Chinese Go player Ke Jie puts a stone against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo during their first match at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, Zhejiang province, China May 23, 2017.  In the first of three planned games in the eastern water town of Wuzhen, the AlphaGo program held off China's world number one Ke Jie in front of Chinese officials and Google parent Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) chief executive Eric Schmidt. The victory over the world's top player - which many thought would take decades to achieve - underlines the potential of artificial intelligence to take on humans at complex tasks. Wooing Beijing may be less simple. The game streamed live on Google-owned YouTube, while executives from the DeepMind unit that developed the program sent out updates live on Twitter (TWTR.N). Both are blocked by China, as is Google search. Google pulled its search engine from China seven years ago after it refused to self-censor internet searches, a requirement of Beijing. Since then it has been inaccessible behind the country's nationwide firewall. The ceremonial game - the second time AlphaGo has gone head-to-head with a master Go player in a public showdown - represents a major bridge-building exercise for Google in China, following a charm offensive in recent years. It has announced plans to bring some services back to the country, including its app store Google Play. In March it also said Chinese users would be able to access the Translate mobile app, marking its most recent success launching a previously banned service. Like AlphaGo, Translate also uses DeepMind's artificial intelligence software. Beijing is pushing to become a major player in artificial intelligence. Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc (BIDU.O), launched an AI lab in March with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. Go, most popular in countries such as China, South Korea and Japan, involves two contestants moving black and white stones across a square grid, aiming to seize the most territory. Its origins date back thousands of years. The board game is favored by AI researchers because of the large number of outcomes compared to other games such as western chess. According to Google there are more potential positions in a Go game than atoms in the universe.  AlphaGo made history when it beat a top South Korean professional player last year.

MUMBAI: If one is even a tiny bit of a Luddite, the mere thought of using online mechanisms to carry out day-to-day transactions ought to be terrifying. Losing humanity to Facebook and its kind was bad enough. Now, Paytm! MobiKwik! Some new combination of familiar words, that's no doubt in the works even as you read this! A terrifying prospect especially in a world of sluggish connections and viruses that make the one devouring mankind in World War Z look like a harmless heat rash, easily cured with thanda Dermi Cool talc. Fortunately for some, we're already quite used to yielding to this tidal wave of technological marvels meant to make our lives simpler, happier and more efficient, particularly in 2017 AD (After Demonetisation). However, can you imagine what it must feel like for a person who recently held a smartphone for the very first time, an individual who has just about grasped Google Search? A few months ago Brand Equity spoke with women in rural India who are part of Google and Tata Trust's 'Internet Saathi' program, a long-term initiative to promote digital literacy in the hinterland. It covers 300,000 villages, by employing women and training them to use the internet. In turn, Google's unlikeliest power-users teach others the Internet ropes. The women we spoke with were, by then, comfortable handling a smartphone and had mastered basics like Search and selfies. They shared with their desire to learn how to use payment apps; "mujhe Paytm sikhna hai", they told us. As it turned out this task was far more daunting. When we caught up with them again, we made some interesting discoveries. For starters, once cash is back, Paytm is kind of out. Parvati Khushwa, who lives in a city called Dholpur in Rajasthan (population - 126,142), has not used any of the payments apps yet as there's no shortage of cash now. However, people in her village often ask about mobile banking apps. That's why she's still keen to learn, so she can teach those interested. Just like Khushwa was before cash flow improved. A millennial by age, Laxmi Rani of Patahensal in West Bengal has downloaded Paytm and SBI's Buddy but the apps are dormant. She is afraid she may do something wrong, losing money in the process. With cash on the other hand, naturally, one feels more in control and secure. Also, she's very confused as different people keep recommending different apps. If it's any consolation, she hasn't offloaded the apps she's downloaded thus far. Rani wants to learn and hopes to put the apps to good use, one day. For their part, banks and the independent ewallet players are trying to these apps less intimidating. With wallets like SBI's Buddy, banks' pedigrees and extensive footprints help by providing a sense of accessibility, familiarity and security. Meanwhile ewallet players have introduced multilingual interface, some accommodating up to 11 languages including Gujarati, Bengali, Oriya, Punjabi, Tamil and Telugu. Speaking the same language is a business imperative if e-wallets want to make any kind of impact outside big cities. Breaking entry barriers, changing behaviours and making the use of e-wallets seem like child's play or at least not so threatening are the other major hurdles. One way to ease people in to this shift is through collaboration and tie-ups with programs like Internet Saathi, which has achieved a reasonable degree of success. MobiKwik did just that earlier this year. Meanwhile, after a recent fund raise of Rs 9000 crore from Japanese conglomerate Softbank, Paytm's parent One97 plans to invest Rs 10,000 crore over the next 3-5 years in bringing 500 million customers on board. A significant number will come from towns like Dholpur and Patahensal. Which brings us to the big question; once women like Laxmi, no longer petrified of Pay-whatchamacallit, come on board, can the cash-rich ewallet-wallahs retain these new users when their offline wallets are again full of laxmi?

Waymo, the company created by Google that makes self-driving car technology, could be spun off into its own firm, one analyst wrote. By Avi Salzman May 23, 2017 4:05 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has signed a deal with Lyft to test its self-driving cars. Photo: Getty Images Alphabet, the parent company of Google, also owns other kinds of companies that it lumps together as “other bets.” Investors tend to downplay what those companies could be worth, as they’re often early-stage investments with minimal revenue. But one of those bets is already shaping up as a game-changer, writes Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak. Waymo, Google’s self-driving car company, recently signed a deal with Lyft to test out its vehicles. Eventually Waymo could be worth $70 billion, Nowak estimates, and be spun off into its own company. That’s a lofty value, given that Nowak doesn’t expect Waymo to generate positive operating profits until 2022. (In total, Alphabet is currently worth about $590 billion when including net debt.) Waymo has various potential ways of making money from self-driving cars, including by using them to gather data on their occupants and sell them things. MORE FROM BARRON’S NEXT Google’s Plan for the Post-Typing World Google Made E-mail Free; Are Cars Next? 2 Stories That Show Why Self-Driving Won’t Come Easily Companies often spin off subsidiaries to allow those companies to follow their own strategies and better determine how to fund themselves (taking out debt for instance). A spinoff also brings in new shareholders who might be more interested in investing directly in self-driving technology as opposed to buying shares of a large company like Alphabet. Generally, the larger company holds onto a stake in the new company after the spinoff so it benefits from the spinoff too. There’s another important reason why Alphabet may one day want to spin off Waymo. Although researchers expect self-driving cars to be safer than human-driven vehicles, Waymo’s vehicles are likely to be involved in crashes that result in substantial liability. If Waymo has 84,000 self-driving vehicles on the road by 2022, its vehicles could be involved in several fatal crashes. “Even assuming Waymo’s cars are involved in 90% fewer crashes than the average human driven car would still involve five per year (roughly one every 10 weeks),” Nowak wrote. “One could argue that even in the event Waymo’s cars are an order of magnitude safer than today’s human driven cars Alphabet may not want to test the U.S. court system for the precedent.” Big Picture: Alphabet, parent company of Google, may eventually want to spin off its self-driving car division.

Lest you fret about the gross invasion of privacy involved, rest assured that the Chocolate Factory promises the info will be anonymised. (Stop laughing, anonymity researchers. We're sure Google means what it says, namely that its solutions will “match transactions back to Google ads in a secure and privacy-safe way, and only report on aggregated and anonymised store sales to protect your customer data”.) So what exactly is Google offering a waiting and grateful world? If it can see your device when you're shopping – the capability it introduced in 2014 called “store visit conversions – it will measure purchases rather than the number of people entering a store. Five billion store visits (Google's measurement claim) doesn't go far enough, which is the reason for the new program. Basically, the cookie-like we-promise-nobody-can-identify-you identity attached to your device will, in a participating store, be associated with customers that actually flash the plastic. If you've got a loyalty program or collect e-mail address info at the counter (get ready for “what's your e-mail address?” from counter staff), the data can be sucked into AdWords “directly or through a third-party data partner”. If not, fear not: Google's signed partners in the financial sector that mean it can see 70 percent of credit card transactions in the US (thankfully, the program's specific to the US at the moment – perhaps because other countries have privacy regimes harder to navigate). As The Consumerist puts it: “your history of ad viewing is still going to be out there, tied to your credit card spending, without a whole lot you can actually do about it”. ® Tips and corrections 16 Comments MORE Google Privacy Advertising Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Ofcom wants automatic compensation for the people when ISPs fail Watchdog proposes fines for everyday repairs, installations and appointments are missed 30 Comments Ofcom chisels away at BT Openreach's cold, dead hands We WILL make you open up infrastructure access, vows regulator 31 Comments Ofcom pressuring BT to slash wholesale prices for superfast broadband Charges for 40Mbps packages to be cut by 40 per cent 35 Comments Ofcom splashed 11% more cash on legal costs with £4.9m war chest Spending fluctuates on how 'companies respond to our decisions' 2 Comments Blighty watchdog Ofcom has a butcher's hook, clocks spectrum for 5G Now all we need is some international standards, and a use case... 16 Comments Ofcom smacks Sky for breaching broadband switching rules Could be in line for a multi-million pound fine 22 Comments Whitepapers Secure Mobile Development Best Practices Covering the vulnerabilities hackers might use to launch an attack, and remediation tips that you can use to build security into your app. Blending Cloud-native and Conventional Applications This IDC InfoBrief, sponsored by Red Hat, reviews ten lessons from early adopters for successful integration of cloud native and traditional applications.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares115 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually. If you don't see the most recent version on Google Play, feel free to pull it down via APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Voice Developer: Google Inc.

Ryne Hager MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK. darrsil Does this fix the voicemails not updating in the Google Phone app? This broke after the Voice redesign. Jeremy Couch This is all I want to know too! I guess I'll try it and report back. Jeremy Couch It's still missing. I'll restart and check again but doesn't look like good news. Ryne Hager Nah, it is still missing. abqnm First being able to finally f*n type to assistant and, and now this, the second major release for Google Voice, all in one week? I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Looks like battery, which is a little redundant. WitnessG Is it part of O or is it a rooted feature cause I think it looks nicer than the regular battery icon. Roh_Mish Nope. Rooted feature. davidofmidnight Now if they would put some effort into accurate transcriptions... Adam Margeson Put some effort into? You should hear the quality of their source material. They've come a *long* way, especially the last couple years. Santos Chavez They have, I've had Google Voice for years and it used to be laughably horrible, but it's vastly improved since then. Even the recent Spanish transcription that was added gets 90% of what was said right. andy_o wth, finally added Spanish? Is it recognized automatically? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ That third blurred out face looks so familiar... Ryne Hager He's just some dick from AP comments. hp-fourtwenty multiple account control!!!!!!!!! Adam Margeson Except they've got it in their terms of use that you only have a single Google voice account. jcopernicus Been there since the last major update, and it's broken if you DONT want an account signed in, as it will randomly try to go through the setup. gvanmeter I hope they fixed photos getting turned sideways after being sent and the lack of 3gppp video support. jcopernicus Still no voip? oh Erick Wright Would be nice if we can make this the default SMS app mama1nana I wonder when Google will allow Google Assistant to send GV sms.

Now in its second developer preview, Android O brings a number of performance improvements and new features. While many of these may just be small tweaks, collectively, they’ll make Android a lot more pleasant to use on the whole. We’ll keep this post updated as new features are discovered and announced in versions of Android to come. If you have a recent Nexus or Pixel device, you can try out Android O for yourself by signing up for the beta program. The usual caveat applies: this is beta software that could very well crash more often and be slower than a stable build. Install at your own risk. Picture-in-picture video Android is getting proper support for picture-in-picture video – essentially a floating video window that will help make sure you never get any work done. PiP as seen on Android TV Though some manufacturers like Samsung have already added this feature, the feature is normally limited to just a few apps. Official Google support means much wider compatibility to come – and hopefully less performance overhead as well. A bunch of notification improvements Android O is changing notifications in a number of important ways, so we’ve grouped the most notable ones together: You can Snooze notifications and have them appear at a later time so you can focus on the task at hand without forgetting whatever you’re getting notified about. Notification channels allow developers to essentially have different notification categories within their apps. For example, in a news app, users could choose to only receive notifications on specific topics. Users can also modify properties such as alert tones, priority and whether notifications show up on your lock screen for each notification channel. Developers can set background colors to help differentiate their notifications from the crowd. Notification badges/dots are exactly what they sound like, a little badge telling you there are unread notifications in a particular app. Unlike iOS, however, Android O doesn’t tell you how many unread notifications you have – only that you have them. Instead, you can long-press on an app icon to view your unread notifications. Thankfully, you can also turn off the feature altogether if, like me, you find notification badges to be more distraction than they’re worth. Messaging notifications can now show more text before you need to enter an app. Android Go Android Go is Google’s new Android fork that promises smoother performance and lower data usage on affordable devices, particularly in developing nations. It’s basically a lighter version of Android O with several optimizations to the kernel and Google’s native Android apps. It also emphasizes power-optimized apps in the Play Store. Android Go will be the default OS for any device with 1GB of RAM or less, though it’s possible we’ll see it appear on devices with more memory in the future. Speed and power improvements As with every version of Android, Google is touting speed and battery improvements with Android O: Google is claiming much faster boot times. The Google Pixel, specifically, can boot twice as fast in O over Nougat. New Background execution limits mean Google is cracking down on apps that abuse their ability to run in the background. Before you worry that Android is becoming iOS, Google is providing alternate means for developers to run background tasks with less performance overhead. This should help improve battery life too. New Emoji Android O is introducing a dramatic overhaul to Emoji – for better or for worse. Gone are the iconic gumdrop blobs, replaced by quasi-circular emoji that are closer to the graphics used by other platforms. Credit: Emojipedia If you ask me, that makes Android lose some of its charm, but at least it will help avoid the confusion caused by some Google emoji looking completely different to the ones on other devices. The redesign also includes all-new emoji – including a bearded person, hijab-clad woman, breastfeeding, dinosaurs, and more – as part of the upcoming release of Emoji 5.0 (part of Unicode 10). You can view the full list of Emoji on Emojipedia. Machine Learning Copy and Paste You’d think copy and paste is a simple enough feature that it doesn’t need updating, but Google’s found a way to improve it with machine learning. Basically, Android O will be clever enough to recognize exactly what you might want to copy and paste with a touch. The company has noticed that most of what people copy and paste are things like business names and addresses, so rather than clumsily selecting tiny text with a couple of cursor knobs, Android’s AI will automatically select what it thinks you’re trying to get at. Of course, you can always modify your selection later, but it should make things go a bit faster. Moreover, Android is smart enough to recognize what kind of selection it is. If you’re copying an address, a floating toolbar will suggest a shortcut to paste the location directly into Google maps. More fingerprint gestures Android O’s developer documentation explains that accessibility services will be able to respond to directional swipes on the fingerprint sensor. While it seems to be meant for accessibility apps, we’re likely to see some apps take advantage of it for custom gestures. Autofill within apps Using autofill on the Web is second nature to save some time inputting things like credit card numbers and addresses, but that doesn’t help you if you need to input this within an app. Android O introduces an Autofill Framework that should solve this issue. It also seems users can set specific apps to manage how forms are filled. Adaptive Icons Icons on Android O can be designed to support a variety of shapes – including squares, circles, and squircles – which should help deal with the style discrepancies among various manufacturers. This is done by giving icons two layers – a background and foreground – so that only the background gets cut off depending on the manufacturer. The two layers also allow for sleeker animation effects, like a pulse, bounce, or parallax. Kotlin Support Google announced native support for the Kotlin programming language at I/O, and developers rejoiced. It’s a relatively young language that is meant to deal with some of Java’s annoyances. Several apps have been using Kotlin code in a patchwork of sorts, but this is the first time you can natively develop Android apps from start to finish with Kotlin. That should hopefully result in more stable code, faster fixes, and a lower threshold for new developers as Kotlin surely moves towards becoming the dominant language for Android in the years to come. Proper color management One of the more subtle reasons macOS and iOS have been so popular with visual artists is that Apple takes color management seriously. Android O brings proper support for wide-gamut displays and media thanks to native support for color profiles like AdobeRGB, DCI-P3 and more. This should also help colors remain a bit more consistent across devices, and allow Android to finally take full advantage of the many wonderful displays out there. Multi-Display Support Android O improved multi-display support substantially, by allowing you to move apps from one panel to another. Apps can specify which display an activity should run on. There aren’t too many scenarios where you’ll use an Android device in a multi-display setup, but it will come in handy from time to time, especially if you use a tablet with a keyboard like the Pixel C. Android TV gets its first major launcher redesign Android TV has pretty much looked the same since it first launched, but in O it’s been significantly redesigned to make it easier to get to the content you want to watch. The idea is that you have different ‘channels’ represented as rows in the launcher. By default there is a row for launching your various apps, and an AI-powered ‘Watch Next’ row that picks out specific shows and videos you might want to watch. Beyond that, apps can create individual channels within the homescreen featuring specific content, with the user’s permission. All this means you should be able to get you your shows more quickly, without having to enter and search within individual apps. Bluetooth 5 Support Android O brings full support for the Bluetooth 5.0 spec. Keep in mind, this is just on the software end, and both your smartphone/tablet and your paired device will need the proper hardware for Bluetooth 5 to work (the Galaxy S8 is currently the only phone with Bluetooth 5). Still, if all those pre-requisites are met, there are plenty of benefits, including twice the transfer speed and four times the range of its predecessor. Perhaps the most practical advantage, however, is the ability to connect two pairs of headphones at once for listening to music with friends. It’s about time. Wi-Fi Aware could make local multiplayer a breeze Wi-Fi Aware allows devices to easily communicate without an internet connection or even being connected to the same access point/router. Nor would you have to turn on Wi-Fi manually. It literally means your device is aware of other nearby devices, somewhat like StreetPass on the Nintendo 3DS. It could make local multiplayer a lot easier to set up on Android, as you wouldn’t have to go through complicated pairing procedures or laggy internet connections. That being said, Wi-Fi Aware needs special hardware support, which Google says it’s working with manufacturers to establish. Turn on Wi-Fi automatically when you get home One of my favorite little announcements from Google I/O was the ability for Android O to turn Wi-Fi on automatically when you arrive to trusted locations, If you tend to turn Wi-Fi off when you’re out and about to conserve battery, this will make your life a lot easier. It’ll also save you precious data should you forget to turn it back on when you get home. Any major features we missed?

As long as you have an internet connection, then Dr Google will see you now. With the amount of information that is freely available online nowadays, there are few subjects where a lack of knowledge will leave you completely in the dark. There are a whole host of medical websites used by two thirds of patients to seek advice about the various health issues they experience through life, according to reports. In recent times, part of a trip to your GP will inevitably include a quick online search before or after for health information – colloquially known as asking "Dr Google". Dr Phil Needham, of Stapenhill Surgery, has suggested that doctors should get involved with the process with looking at symptoms and conditions online. He said: "I'm not completely computer literate, but I think being able to go online together as patient and GP can be quite interesting and useful. Care has to be taken though, there is all sorts of rubbish and nonsense online. There is the classic case of looking on Google after having sore legs and being told that you have cancer." READ MORE: Staffordshire's police and crime commissioner vows to go further on mental health Dr Needham also claimed that alternative solutions or explanations for medical issues can be found that may have not been found before if doctors use these online sources. He said: "Problems could arise, I don't want to see doctors constantly using medical sites. Having a patient present an issue, and straight away they're on the computer looking it up, it doesn't look great. It's worth remembering that doctors aren't expected to remember everything. "We are taught to always run things past other doctors, and I think this can help with that. Altogether, if this is used the right way, it's a very good resource. I would definitely say that it's more positive than negative." Searching online before an appointment can have a positive contribution to a GP consultation These comments came from Dr Needham after a study undertaken by a team of researchers from Belgium concluded that "searching online before an appointment can generally have a positive contribution to a GP consultation." This study, which has been published in the British Journal of General Practice, gathered information on 718 Flemish patients aged between 18 and 75. More than half of the patients studied suggested they had more confidence in their GP after searching for additional information online. The report read: "The large majority of the Flemish population would still visit the doctor after online information retrieval and the patient's confidence in their GP is rarely affected. "On the contrary, it may lead to a better mutual understanding of symptoms and diagnosis, therefore an open attitude toward the patient and their online search behaviour is recommended. GPs often overestimate the possible anxiety caused by an online information search." Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, the chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs commented on the study, saying: "We encourage all of our patients to take an active interest in their own health. "We would certainly advise caution about patients using 'Dr Google' to diagnose themselves - searching the internet is no substitute for a discussion with a GP as we are highly trained to take into account the physical, psychological and social factors affecting a patient's health and wellbeing when making a diagnosis. If a patient has consulted a reliable site and is still worried about their health, they should seek advice from their GP practice or local pharmacy."

When calling for medical information, there are two possible numbers to call, 999 and 111, but how do these differ? Emergency services constantly make the point that 999 is for life-threatening situation. But it is also emphasised that what you believe to be a life-threatening situation may not seem so to someone else. Always use your own initiative, if you believe you are in a life-threatening situation or see somebody else to be in one, and need emergency medical care, don't be afraid to call 999. 999 is for when someone is seriously ill or injured, and their life is at risk. The NHS has published this online as a handy guide to calling 999. Medical emergencies can include: Loss of consciousness An acute confused state Fits that are not stopping Persistent, severe chest pain Breathing difficulties Severe bleeding that cannot be stopped Severe allergic reactions Severe burns or scalds Call 999 immediately if you or someone else is having a heart attack or stroke, in situations like these, every second counts. 111 is the non-emergency number where you can receive medical advice fast, but if it's not a 999 emergency. Fast, easy, free and available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. You will speak to a health advisor, who will ask you a series of questions to assess your symptoms and then advise you on what treatment is needed and what treatment could be needed. According to the NHS, 111 should be used in the following situations. Call 111 if: You need medical help fast but it's not a 999 emergency You think you need to go to A&E or need another NHS urgent care service You don't know who to call or you don't have a GP to call You need health information or reassurance about what to do next If the incident is less urgent, contact your GP or local pharmacist. *Read more of today's top news stories here.

She says it is a necessary step: What we are being told is that it’s an ongoing investigation, an active operation … Until we can be reassured there is no continued activity … that it is entirely safe … then it is right that we are at this heightened state of alert. Rudd says the decision to raise the threat level was “intelligence-driven”, but she is reluctant to say whether the attacker, Salman Abedi, was on a watch list: We do know that he was known, up to a point, to the intelligence services. I can’t be drawn on [how]. She says the intelligence services “do a remarkably good job”, adding that they have “foiled 13 plots since 2013”: We need to give them the space they need to continue their investigation. Rudd says officials are very aware that there are a lot of large public events this weekend, including the football cup finals in England and Scotland, and says the police “will provide additional support”: I am reassuring people by saying we need to carry on with our way of life but we need to be aware … staying alert, reporting anything that they see, being a bit more vigilant than normal.

Although UK journalists had Salman Abedi’s name, the UK government and Greater Manchester police declined to confirm it more than two hours after it appeared in the US press. Earlier in the day, the government indicated it might not release the name at all on Tuesday because the investigation was continuing.

Sturgeon said: While raising the UK terror threat level to critical has been judged a necessary response to the despicable attack in Manchester, we must not allow terrorism to triumph. I urge the people of Scotland to be vigilant but not alarmed and, as far as possible, to go about their business as usual. Police Scotland have already visibly increased their presence in locations such as transport hubs and city centres as a precaution. Security arrangements for upcoming public events, including this weekend’s Scottish Cup final, are being thoroughly reviewed and the public should anticipate additional safety measures such as full body and bag searches.

The elevation to the highest notch means “not only that an attack remains highly likely but a further attack may be imminent”. What it also means is that soldiers will be immediately deployed to Britain’s streets to support the police. In an operation codenamed Temperer, military officials will patrol key sites and public events. This will include an extra armed presence at the FA Cup final at Wembley and the Premiership rugby final at Twickenham this weekend.

Updated at 2.13am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.54am EDT 01:54 Alan Travis The decision to raise the official threat level to critical and to deploy troops under Operation Temperer, meaning that an attack is expected imminently, is the first time for a decade that it has been set at its highest level. The last time troops under Operation Temperer were deployed was immediately after the terrorist attacks in Brussels last year, but they were only used covertly as backup for the visible armed police presence at railway stations and airports. It means that up to 5,000 armed troops can be deployed at transport hubs and other crowded public places in order to release the armed police for other duties. The threat level has only twice before been raised to critical since the system of official threat levels was introduced on 1 August 2006. It was raised for three days from 10 August 2006 at the time of the transatlantic airliner plot, and on 30 June 2007 when the security services uncovered a plot to bomb a nightclub on London’s Haymarket. This was a plot that culminated in the attack on Glasgow airport.

'Go sing with the angels': families and friends pay tribute to Manchester victims Read more Updated at 1.55am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.11am EDT 01:11 Jason Burke In recent years a shift has occurred: attacks on “lifestyle” targets have become increasingly common. Why this shift, and why are such targets so apparently attractive to a terrorist? One reason is that the more obvious targets – the military bases, embassies, government offices, airports and so on – are better protected than they were a decade ago. Terrorist targets are often determined by what is feasible, not by what fits a master plan. Another reason for the shift is that al-Qaida, now relatively weaker than before, and Islamic State, which has become pre-eminent among jihadis, differ on tactics and strategy, even if their aims coincide. The veterans of al-Qaida prioritise building support for their extremist project and try to strike targets that they believe potential sympathisers will regard as legitimate. They may justify some attacks as being in line with their reading of Islamic law which calls for fair retaliation – in their case for Muslim casualties of western military actions. Others can be justified by deeming citizens of western nations collectively responsible for the acts of their governments. But even al-Qaida would probably consider killing teenagers at a concert to be beyond the pale. Not Isis however. The group relies on escalating brutality to terrorise target populations, whether in the west or the Middle East.

Updated at 1.56am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.43am EDT 00:43 Killer had recently visited Libya – reports There are reports that Salman Abedi, named as the perpetrator of the attack, had visited Libya recently, with some saying he returned to the UK only days before he killed 22 people at the Manchester Arena. The Times reports that he spent time in Libya, citing an unnamed school friend: He went to Libya three weeks ago and came back recently, like days ago. Abedi was British, but his family is from Libya. The Guardian understands that his father, Abu Ismail Abedi, is thought to be in Tripoli. The Sun reports that Salman Abedi may have used trips to Libya to travel to Syria. This has not been confirmed. The Guardian has one of the first pictures of Abedi, taken during an Islamic class at the Didsbury mosque: Salman Abedi.

Brewster had attended the Ariana Grande concert with her sister Claire and niece, Hollie Booth. They were both injured in the attack and are being treated in hospital. Friends of Brewster have paid tribute to her on on social media. Her uncle, Paul Dryhurst, earlier described how she had been caught up in the blast: Kelly has shielded Hollie and Claire from the damage. The three were walking out in single file, with Claire in front, Hollie behind her, and Kelly behind her. When the bomb has gone off, the impact has broken Claire’s jaw and broken Hollie’s legs. They are both currently in hospital having nuts and bolts removed from all places.

The teenager was the subject of a massive social media campaign to find her after she could not be contacted in the wake of the explosion. Her mother, Charlotte Campbell, confirmed overnight that Olivia had died, in a public Facebook post dedicated to “my darling precious gorgeous girl”. She spoke to the media on Tuesday about her desperate attempts to make contact with her daughter: I’m at home phoning everybody: hospitals, police, the centres that the children have been put in. Her dad’s in Manchester looking for her. I’ve got friends looking for her. I’ve got people I don’t even know looking for her, people messaging me, saying we’ve got her photo, looking for her, we’ll get in contact if we see her. And I’m just hearing nothing. Her phone’s dead… They’ve basically told me to stay put and wait for a phone call. I daren’t leave the house just in case she somehow gets home.

The move came in the wake of the suicide bombing of Manchester Arena, which killed 22 people and injured 59 more. The perpetrator has been identified as Salman Abedi, 22, a Mancunian of Libyan descent. He walked into the lobby of the arena on Monday evening as thousands of people were exiting an Ariana Grande concert, detonating an improvised device that murdered and maimed many. Among those he killed were eight-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos; Georgina Callander, 18; and John Atkinson, 28. Overnight, the names of two more victims have been revealed: Kelly Brewster, 32, and Olivia Campbell, who was 15. Her mother Charlotte Campbell paid tribute to her “darling precious gorgeous girl”. Several people remain missing, many of them teenagers, with family and friends continuing to share their names and pictures on social media. In messages posted online, Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, but this has not been confirmed by officials investigating the blast. There are reports today that Abedi had recently returned from a trip to Libya. A 23-year-old man was arrested on Tuesday morning in south Manchester, and is believed to be Ismael Abedi, the brother of the perpetrator. All parties have suspended campaigning for the 8 June general election. The prime minister, Theresa May, condemned the attack as: Appalling, sickening cowardice, deliberately targeting innocent, defenceless children and young people who should have been enjoying one of the most memorable nights of their lives. A vigil held in Manchester’s Albert Square on Tuesday evening drew thousands in solidarity with those killed and wounded.

Google makes its money by putting its services on devices of any type, and this move furthers the company's strategy. Google already has Android Pay, which offers one-touch purchasing for all Android devices. But the company rightly realized that there are hundreds of millions of users that store credit cards with Google but don’t use Android Devices. This is Google taking advantage of data they already have to improve functionality. IMAGE: Bloomberg News All in all, Google should have access to nearly 2 billion users across Android and Google properties, with more than 2 billion Android devices in use every day and a few hundred million Google accounts with credit cards. (Some people might have multiple devices.) As Google continues to train its users on the benefits of one-touch payments, it has the opportunity to skim a small percent off of an ever-growing volume of transactions from its user base. In the past, retailers have given little attention to instant pay technologies like Apple Pay and Android Pay. But the bottom line is that consumers will spend more if they are presented with a positive shopping experience. Line-busting techniques like one-touch payment options can help brands enjoy enhanced opportunities to address the need for convenience and create one seamless, personalized process, online and offline. The less shoppers are waiting the more inclined they are to continue shopping. For giants like Apple and Google, mobile wallet functions are a great notch on their belts for enhancing expectations around the consumer experience. For retailers, the opportunity to increase conversion both online and offline is needed, since mobile conversion is often one third of what it is on desktop. Additionally, there’s no downside to putting more efforts into these areas. If more users turn to Google and Apple devices in place of a traditional wallet, it only increases the time they spend on their devices. This furthers the virtuous adoption cycle and allows companies such as Google to continue selling ads and services. Apple is trying to catch up in this area, but I would expect further investment from both parties in the years to come. At the end of the day, the easier it is for shoppers to buy products, the more money they will spend a stores and the more time they will spend on their phones.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares115 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually. If you don't see the most recent version on Google Play, feel free to pull it down via APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Voice Developer: Google Inc.

Ryne Hager Nah, it is still missing. abqnm First being able to finally f*n type to assistant and, and now this, the second major release for Google Voice, all in one week? I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar?

Intelligent Machines He Built the Xbox—Can He Make a Microsoft Product Out of Quantum Computing? Todd Holmdahl says that starting from behind won’t keep Microsoft from winning the race to commercialize quantum computing. by Tom Simonite May 24, 2017 Microsoft executive Todd Holmdahl has led teams to invent profitable new computing hardware products before. His latest project is his first with a chance of hauling in a Nobel Prize in physics as well as new revenue if it succeeds. Holmdahl previously oversaw the hardware design of the Xbox and Xbox360 consoles, which rake in billions for Microsoft each year. Late last year he was appointed the leader of a swelling band of mathematicians, physicists, and engineers trying to add mighty computers powered by quantum physics to Microsoft’s menu of cloud computing services. Holmdahl speaks about quantum computing like a tech executive would a new line of business, not a speculative physics or R&D project. “I am personally competitive, and my whole history is producing products,” he says. “We have line of sight to a commercial product.” What problem would you like quantum computers to solve? Tell us in the comments. A quick glance at competing projects in quantum computing makes that kind of talk surprising. Google, IBM, and even some startups have already demonstrated prototype hardware capable of crunching data (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies: Practical Quantum Computing”). Microsoft isn’t yet close. Holmdahl’s crew is chasing a different approach to quantum hardware based on manipulating a subatomic particle called the Majorana fermion, which the physics community isn’t 100 percent sure has ever been seen. It’s named after the man who predicted its existence, Italian physicist Ernesto Majorana, who in 1938 emptied his bank account, caught a ferry, and disappeared without a trace. While Google and IBM work on their next prototypes, Microsoft’s physicists are trying to build the first device that can conclusively isolate and encode a single digital bit of data with the particle Majorana predicted. Yet Holmdahl resists the suggestion that this means his company is unlikely to be first to market. “I think we actually will be,” he says. Finicky hardware Quantum computers are built out of devices known as qubits, which represent data using physics only apparent at very tiny scales. Tech companies and investors have sunk millions into the technology, because at the quantum scale, particles and information can do things that are flat out impossible in our human-sized reality. This means some calculations that would take centuries on a conventional computer can be done in seconds on a quantum computer. Google and others hope to use quantum computers to power up machine learning, and renting them out to solve problems in chemistry and materials science (see “Chemists Are First in Line for Quantum Computing’s Benefits”). The catch is that although qubits can be built in various ways—the most advanced are based on superconducting metal circuits or metal ions floating inside magnetic fields—they are all unreliable because quantum states are so delicate. This month IBM announced the biggest chip made by the companies in the race for a general-purpose quantum computer—a chip with just 17 qubits. To do useful work, a quantum computer would likely need many thousands or millions of the devices. Subscribe to The Download What's important in technology and innovation, delivered to you every day.

Incorrect email format Manage your newsletter preferences Microsoft’s project is a giant bet on the idea that qubits based on the elusive Majorana fermion will be much more reliable, and thus easier to build into large collections that can do useful work. A theory known as topological quantum computing predicts that data written into the particles, by a device called a topological qubit, will be resilient to perturbations that would wipe out anything stored by a regular qubit (see “Microsoft’s Quantum Mechanics”). “Once we can find a way to realize qubits in this topological way, then we know they can support computation,” says Xie Chen, an assistant professor of theoretical physics at CalTech. “The issue is, can we even build one qubit?” Right now, she says, experimental physicists are mostly but not sure the necessary particles have even been seen. Huge gamble When Holmdahl joined Microsoft’s project late in 2016, so did two leading experimental physicists trying to clear up that uncertainty. Charlie Marcus, at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark, and Leo Kouwenhoven, at Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands, will keep working in their university labs but are getting teams of Microsoft engineers and new equipment to work on the company’s quantum quest. Recommended for You Curiosity May Be Vital for Truly Smart AI The World’s Largest Wind Turbines Have Started Generating Power in England StarCraft Pros Are Ready to Battle AI Why Google’s CEO Is Excited About Automating Artificial Intelligence Google Thinks It Has Cracked the VR Adoption Problem Kouwenhoven has made some of the most promising potential sightings of Majorana fermions yet, at the ends of carefully designed semiconductor nanowires. He and Microsoft’s other physicists are now working on alternative structures they think will allow undisputable detection and manipulation of the particles—and become the first working topological qubits. Instead of using tiny wires, they rely on growing flat sheets of semiconductor material. Holmdahl says that method fits with established electronics manufacturing techniques, so that when—or should that be if?—the company builds its first topological qubit, it can ramp up to big devices faster than groups working with the more finicky qubits that exist today. “We effectively have a road map that allows us to go from a few qubits to a few thousand qubits,” says Holmdahl. Read Next Microsoft’s Quantum Mechanics Can an aging corporation’s adventures in fundamental physics research open a new era of unimaginably powerful computers? Microsoft also has a research group at its Redmond, Washington, campus working on how to use those qubits when they become available. One of its activities is figuring out just how many qubits would be needed to do useful work in areas such as machine learning or chemistry simulations. Krysta Svore, who leads the group, says one recent result has the potential to slash that number—for both Microsoft and its competitors. Her researchers figured out how to cut the number of qubits needed to perform a crucial operation to quantum algorithms. “It promises that you might be running large algorithms sooner,” says Svore. The fact that Microsoft publishes such results openly, helping the field advance, is one reason Scott Aaronson, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, is supportive of the company’s project, even though he’s unsure if it will pan out. “Microsoft is taking a huge gamble,” says Aaronson. “There's at least a plausible hope that topological quantum computing could leapfrog over superconducting [qubits] and ion-trap quantum computing once it works at all—but it's also true that superconducting and ion-traps are way ahead.” Asked to say just when he thinks Microsoft can build its first topological qubit to make the competition really interesting, Holmdahl, who is 52, initially demurs. But he can’t resist at least narrowing it down. “I’m going to be retired shortly,” he says. “I think it will be before then.” Cut off? Read unlimited articles today.

And for years, Google was fine with that. Weeks after Google hired him in 2007 to work on a global photo database called Street View, Mr. Levandowski, then 27 years old, registered a startup to sell a sensor system to Google for the same project, according to public records and former employees of both companies. Quotes in the article Toyota Motor Corp TM ▲ 108.08 +0.58 +0.54% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 68.68 +0.23 +0.34% For the next four years, Mr. Levandowski split his time between his day job at Google and the startup, 510 Systems LLC, an hour away in Berkeley, Calif., where he directed employees to develop technology related to his Google projects, including self-driving cars, according to former 510 Systems employees. After Google discovered the side business, instead of reprimanding Mr. Levandowski for a potential conflict of interest, it ultimately bought 510 Systems for about $20 million. Now Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Uber are embroiled in a legal fight over driverless-car technology, with Mr. Levandowski playing a starring role. The two firms, along with several other companies, are locked in a race to automate cars, a contest that could affect the future of transportation. A look back at Mr. Levandowski’s nine years at Google shows an employee who sometimes operated at the edge of what a typical company would accept—even one like Google that encourages entrepreneurialism among its workers. While Google’s approach helps it create new businesses, it also can spark disagreements between the company and its employees over who owns certain technology. Alphabet accuses Mr. Levandowski of stealing its driverless-car technology and bringing it to Uber, which he joined as its head of its driverless-car project last year after earning more than $120 million at Google. Alphabet has filed two arbitration claims against Mr. Levandowski and is suing Uber for allegedly conspiring with him. © Eric Risberg/Associated Press Last week, the judge handling the civil lawsuit asked federal prosecutors to investigate Alphabet’s allegations that Mr. Levandowski stole the trade secrets. Load Error Uber, a ride-hailing company, denies wrongdoing and is contesting the accusations in court. It isn’t clear how Mr. Levandowski has responded to the arbitration claims, which are private. Uber declined to make him available for an interview and he didn’t respond to requests for comment. This account of Mr. Levandowski’s tenure at Google and simultaneous work for his own companies is based on interviews with a dozen former 510 Systems and Google employees, and on court filings and other public records. Google encourages employees to spend 20% of their work time on side projects of their choosing that benefit the company, and it has created a so-called incubator for employees to found startups inside the company. Some eventually leave to start their own ventures, such as social-media firms Instagram and Pinterest Inc. Even Google’s co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, have launched their own outside companies in recent years, including firms developing flying cars and an airship. Mr. Levandowski’s outside companies benefited Google for years. Technology developed by 510 Systems helped Google create its own maps and avoid paying for third-party data. When Google launched its self-driving car program in 2009, one of its first vehicles was a Toyota Prius that Mr. Levandowski and 510 Systems engineers had rigged up for a TV show. The employment agreements signed by many Google employees bar them from starting outside companies that conflict with Google’s interests, such as online advertising. It isn’t known when Google learned about Mr. Levandowski’s initial side project, 510 Systems, or whether his employment agreement permitted his activities there. Mr. Levandowki started other businesses later in his Google tenure, public records indicate, including an online game for betting on stock-market trends and a California factory building prefabricated housing. Two of the other later startups led to Alphabet’s claims against Mr. Levandowski and Uber. Mr. Levandowski, who stands 6 feet 6 inches tall, was born in Brussels and came to the U.S. in the early 1990s, at age 14. As a teenager in Marin County, north of San Francisco, he created a digital map of his school and started a company to provide technical support for local businesses’ websites. He caught the bug for robots as an industrial-engineering student at the University of California, Berkeley, where he made one with Lego pieces that could sort Monopoly money. He also began experimenting with driverless vehicles, organizing classmates to enter a 2004 Defense Department competition to race autonomous cars across the Mojave Desert. To save money, the team built a driverless motorcycle, dubbed Ghostrider. It crashed within seconds but is now displayed at the Smithsonian Institution. Around 2006, before he joined Google, Mr. Levandowski was part of a digital-mapping project called VuTool, which used sensor technology developed for the Defense Department race. Google’s Mr. Page was looking for a similar tool for its burgeoning maps service. He believed Google’s mission to “organize the world’s information” needed a lot more data from streets, according to employees who worked on the project, which became Street View. Google’s team was struggling with an expensive high-resolution camera. Sunlight streaked through images. VuTool was moving faster by using off-the-shelf parts and a system built by Mr. Levandowski and a few classmates that combined information from multiple sensors. Google hired Mr. Levandowski and the VuTool team in the spring of 2007. A few weeks later, Mr. Levandowski registered 510 Systems, named after Berkeley’s area code. He soon began selling his sensor-fusion system to Google via a middleman. The black-and-yellow box became the brains of the Street View system. It synchronized information from multiple sensors, including cameras, satellite data and the cars’ wheels, so images gathered as the vehicles drove through neighborhoods would precisely match where they were taken. During 510 Systems’ first several months, Google was its only customer. Former 510 Systems employees say the transactions occurred through a middleman that branded the devices, sold them to Google and eventually manufactured them directly. Google bought more than 100 over the first year. Former 510 Systems employees said they kept quiet about their high-profile customer, giving Google the code name Aspen. Mr. Levandowski told few employees at 510 Systems about his Google job, although some figured it out because he often wore Google apparel, the former employees say. Fellow engineers on Google’s Street View team knew of Mr. Levandowski’s connection to 510 Systems, a former Google employee says. Alphabet lawyers have suggested Google executives initially didn’t know they were buying technology from one of their own employees. “You did not disclose to Google your involvement with 510 Systems…before Google discovered your involvement with them, correct?” an Alphabet lawyer asked Mr. Levandowski in a deposition last month, according to a transcript. Mr. Levandowski declined to answer, invoking his Fifth Amendment rights. At 510 Systems, Mr. Levandowski appeared sporadically, often scheduling meetings with managers late at night, former employees say. He brought on his stepmother, Suzanna Musick, as chief executive to help manage the dozen or so employees. Former employees described Ms. Musick, a former consultant, as a competent manager but unschooled in the technology. Ms. Musick didn’t respond to requests for comment. By 2008, 510 Systems’ devices were helping Google offer street-level images for dozens of U.S. cities. Then Google halted its purchases. It had reverse-engineered the system and built its own, according to employees of both companies. By that time, 510 Systems was selling its sensor systems to surveying firms and later to Microsoft Corp. Through the middleman, 510 Systems sold Google camera rigs similar to the Street View ones for about 20 small planes Google used to take aerial images for its maps. Mr. Levandowski’s passion for robots hadn’t faded. In 2008, he was asked to make a driverless vehicle to deliver a pizza for a Discovery Channel show. He formed another startup, Anthony’s Robots LLC, and assembled a few 510 Systems engineers to modify a Toyota Prius to make it drive on its own. Weeks later, the car—emblazoned with 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots decals—drove over San Francisco’s Bay Bridge with a police escort and pizza inside. Months later, in 2009, that car became a seed vehicle for Google’s driverless-car project, a bold new venture for a company based on internet search and advertising. Over the next year, Mr. Levandowski quietly shifted 510 Systems’ focus toward driverless cars, pulling 510 Systems engineers onto driverless-car projects. 510 Systems quietly began supplying Google with self-driving technology, including a modified sensor-fusion box and a system that connected computers to a car’s steering wheel, gas and brakes. Photographs viewed by The Wall Street Journal show three of Google’s self-driving vehicles at 510 Systems’ headquarters in late 2010. The companies’ unusual relationship hardly registered with 510 Systems employees. “Amongst ourselves we said, ‘That’s a little strange, isn’t it?’” said former 510 Systems software engineer Ben Discoe. “But that was extent of it. We liked our jobs.” At last month’s deposition, an Alphabet lawyer asked Mr. Levandowski: “You used confidential information from Google to help develop technology at 510 Systems, correct?” Then, “You brought Google Street View source code to 510 Systems…correct?” Mr. Levandowski invoked the Fifth Amendment. Two former 510 Systems employees said in interviews Mr. Levandowski often would return from a day at Google and suddenly have answers to engineering questions the 510 Systems team had been struggling with. One day in early 2011, 510 Systems employees awoke to an email from Mr. Levandowski calling a companywide meeting. At the headquarters, they lined up to sign a nondisclosure agreement at a desk manned by Mr. Levandowski. Then he announced Google was buying 510 Systems and Anthony’s Robots for its driverless-car program. The 510 Systems team gathered at Google headquarters that afternoon for barbecue, beers and rides in self-driving cars. The mood soured when the deal’s details came out. Mr. Levandowski had sold the company for about $20 million, just below the threshold at which employees would have shared in the proceeds. Google eventually hired about half of the company’s 50 or so employees. Mr. Levandowski signed a noncompete agreement that for two years barred any outside involvement in a variety of areas, including sensors, robotics and driverless cars. The relationship between Google and 510 Systems “was completely tangled,” says Mr. Discoe, the former 510 Systems software engineer. “I guess the decision to be bought or not be bought was basically: Are we going to untangle this or are we just going to give up and merge it?” More than five years later, the most valuable piece of the acquisition is 510 Systems’ lidar system, a laser sensor crucial to driverless cars because it allows them to effectively see their surroundings. The system was the predecessor to the lidar that Waymo, Alphabet’s recently renamed autonomous-vehicle unit, now uses on its most advanced driverless cars. That lidar, one of Waymo’s most valuable technologies, also is at the center of the claims Alphabet has filed against Mr. Levandowski and Uber. Alphabet has alleged that Mr. Levandowski continued his side dealings in violation of his noncompete agreement. In August 2012, a year after the 510 Systems acquisition, a new business making lidar was founded at 510 Systems’ former headquarters, a building owned by Mr. Levandowski, Alphabet alleges. Public records show the new company, Odin Wave LLC, was originally registered by Mr. Levandowski’s personal lawyer. That lawyer didn’t respond to requests for comment. At the time, Mr. Levandowski ran the lidar team at Google. Mr. Levandowski quit Google in January 2016, days after launching his own driverless-car venture, Ottomotto LLC. Alphabet alleges that when he left, he took 14,000 confidential files about Google’s lidar system, and some top engineers. Mr. Levandowski then merged Ottomotto with the lidar business housed at the former 510 Systems headquarters, Alphabet alleges. In August, Uber bought the new company for $680 million in stock. Court documents show Mr. Levandowski received more than $250 million.

Apple launched its smartphones pretty much every year in September. Google, on the other hand, just likes to play with our feelings, making it difficult to realize when new devices or updates will be released, by throwing launches all over the calendar. Google has ditched the Nexus brand over the new Pixel brand which was launched early in October and it’s making his appearance as the new Apple’s iPhone competitor who launched the month before. It’s unusual for Apple to have a new competitor in such a short time. We just hope that Google sticks to a regular schedule from now on. iPhone 7 It was launched in September 2016 with not so many changes, the reason is probably to keep all the good stuff for 2017. But it does have some new interesting things added, like a better processor, camera set-up and the most exciting, waterproofing! Rumors about 2017 There will be some changes regarding the iPhone’s style. It’s said to be the FIRST OLED display iPhone ever! The style shell will be made from either curved glass or clear Zirconia ceramic and the Touch ID Home key will be hidden under the display glass. How amazing is that? How amazing is that? By Samsung’s exploding Galaxy Note 7, the iPhone has never received so much attention on the market since its iPhone 7 release in September. But things are not the same now. Google’s Nexus line is soon to be forgotten and replaced by the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones with Android Nougat. Similarities Both declare to have the best cameras. Both declare to be the smartest smartphones ever built. Both have conservative designs. Both will definitely receive updates when they’re ready. And, of course, they are both quite expensive. It is indeed, a very difficult choice to make when it comes to buying one of these two devices. However, the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera is otherworldly, an excellent choice for those who are in love with photography. For various PC problems, we recommend to use this tool.

Both designs are simple, clean and tidy and attract the eye. Apple’s elegance is outstanding, being thinner and a little bit lightweight, with a familiar overall aesthetic with the metal surround and black panel.Google’s Google’s style, however, strive for an industrial appearance with the brushed metal look and glass back panel design with the Touch ID fingerprint scanner incorporated on the back of the device, while Apple’s is incorporated in the Home key. In this area, Google could have done better! While Google’s Pixel only offers IP53 splash proofing to protect your device, Apple offers for the first time on an iPhone, full IP67 water and dust resistance. The final battle: Battery life The iPhone 7’s battery life doesn’t compare to its larger Plus model sibling. The same thing goes for The Pixel and Pixel XL. But how does Pixel compare to the iPhone 7? Well, Pixel has around 20% more longevity in the battery department than Apple’s device, especially with heavy use. Based on these facts, it’s up to any of you to form an opinion and choose what you think suits you better!

This Android’s new update is only available for: Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X and Nexus Player. VOLVO united its forces with Google and made the partnership public this week, offering access to a lot of apps and services. As you might know, Project Treble is the most important Android update which is also trying to accelerate the process by making better „Android Distribution Numbers” posts. How to download the app Google includes a similar feature for its Android users, just like for its Windows phones. The software that’s in charge of the graphics processor can be updated through Google store for Android, without receiving a new firmware. But in order to do that, you are required to own a Google smartphone. Rumors It said that Google is currently testing three phones – Pixel 2 and Pixel 2XL and a new device code named Taimen. Of course, Project Treble won’t solve the Android’s fragmentation. Android O provides an easy way for you to fill the form’s gaps. Lowe’s has provided access to Google map 400 navigation through Tango devices that can transfer you directly to your shopping list. The OS was launched in February 2016 but no one knows exactly if and how it will take to reach the point to commercial products. There is a unique version of the Playstore, owned by Android Go to provide users with new versions of part of the most widely usable apps. Backup your data, save your space The Google Pixel 2 is more likely to have Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5, which protects your phone by surviving a 1.6-meter drops onto rough surfaces. But just in case, before you manage to update your device, you should backup your files. Google will also force Android apps to consume less space and most importantly, use less RAM.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures. Anthrox give it some time today is the first lunch of software outside of play and play music. software is complex you have many different teams with different goals the family support might be coming after other feature they need to do first makapav Humbug excuses. Just like how after 7 years of phone launches, it's still a difficult problem to solve. Or 15 messaging apps later... Yuri Vidal US Only... =( Kunal God dammit Google!

  You are here: Home > Business > Technology, Media and Telecom Chinese confident about AI Wei Jia 0 Comment(s)Print E-mail China.org.cn, May 24, 2017 Adjust font size: From applications that are already a part of many people's everyday lives, such as Siri, smart TVs and Google translation, to more futuristic incarnations like self-driving cars and robots at the beck and call of their human masters, artificial intelligence, or AI, is shaping up to be a revolutionary force likened to the steam engine and electricity. A fleet of Baidu self-driving cars during a road test in November, 2011 [Photo/VCG] Partly fueled by apocalyptic movies like Terminator, however, are the concerns over the rise of machines. Even Elon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, once compared developing AI to "summoning the demon." That fear is not dominant among Chinese people. In The Age of Artificial Intelligence: Impact and Implications published on May 22 by Jinri Toutiao, China's top news and information mobile application that uses AI technology to offer personalized content, the index of Chinese confidence about AI is 83 out of 100, which means an optimistic and rational attitude to the next big thing in technology. When asked whether they support the development of AI, 51.3% answered in the affirmative, 28.68% chose "supportive with reservations," while 15.77% said the pace should be slowed and more investments made in preparation for AI gone out of humans' control. A mere 2.4% staunchly opposed AI. As for their biggest fear over the advent of AI, more than half cited social crisis caused by AI becoming its own master. Still, people are eager to see AI in the driver's seat; the report shows that Chinese view self-driving cars being developed by Google as the hottest AI product. Baidu, China's leading search engine, is also betting on autonomous driving. Ramping up its challenge to Google and Tesla, Baidu opened up its driverless car technology for auto makers to use in April. By 2020, the company expects to have polished technology that allows its self-drive cars to navigate highways and open city roads. Baidu is actually the top name on the most watched AI company list for Chinese speakers in the report, followed by such tech giants as Google, Alibaba, Xiaomi and Huawei. According to the report, automobiles are only the third most promising industry for AI application, the first and second places going to finance and digital sectors. On the more immediate survey of the AI-related topic you care most about, "Which jobs would be taken over by AI" understandably took the top place. According to a survey by AI Era, an AI-focused think tank, there were about 200 AI startups in China as of September 2016. Most of them were formed after 2010 and 70% of those companies engaged in research in visual and voice recognition, with some of the breakthroughs in facial recognition technology made by Chinese companies. The momentum of AI growth in China is boosted by the government's ambition. The Chinese government has identified AI as a field of strategic importance and in the country's latest five-year plan (2016-2020), intelligent manufacturing and robots are among the key innovation projects. With a bright future of AI in China all but certain, it's necessary to take the confidence in the technology with a pinch of salt and address the real concern over the wider ramifications of the technology as is reflected in the Toutiao report. The rapid automation of factories and warehouses, for example, has rendered large numbers of employees redundant. How to blunt the impact of AI applications for the vulnerable, both on the factory floor and beyond, should be pushed higher up on every tech-driven government's agenda.

Most economists and budget experts dismiss that promise as fancifully unrealistic. ___ Trump budget keeps pledges: Cuts for poor, more for military WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise Tuesday, proposing a $4.1 trillion budget plan that would upend Washington in a big way. But he drew rebukes, even from some Republican allies, for the plan's jarring, politically unrealistic cuts to the social safety net for the poor and a broad swath of other domestic programs. ___ Only on AP: CEO pay climbed faster last year, up 8.5 percent NEW YORK (AP) — The typical CEO at the biggest U.S. companies got an 8.5 percent raise last year and made $11.5 million in salary, stock and other compensation, according to a study by executive data firm Equilar for The Associated Press. It's their biggest raise in three years, but pay notably lagged for CEOs at companies where shareholders' protests about executive compensation have been loudest. ___ US says Fiat Chrysler used software to cheat emissions tests DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government says Fiat Chrysler used software on nearly 104,000 Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees that makes them emit fewer pollutants during emissions tests than in real-world driving. The company disputes the charges. ___ Fox News finds itself in an unaccustomed spot — out of first NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News Channel isn't used to losing to its cable news rivals, but was beaten last week by MSNBC. In a more youthful demographic prized by advertisers, Fox finished third to MSNBC and CNN for the first time in 17 years. Fox is trying to establish a new prime-time lineup following Bill O'Reilly's firing ___ Google helps advertisers track spending in physical stores SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google says its new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. Still, privacy advocates are worried. ___ Ford's new CEO promises a fit — but fun — company DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) — Ford's new CEO, Jim Hackett, revealed a little about his plans — and a lot about himself — when he talked to media after his appointment. He spoke of the importance of the company's core auto business, inspiration from his former football coach — University of Michigan legend Bo Schembechler — and the need for a little fun on the job. ___ Target, states reach $18.5 million settlement on data breach NEW YORK (AP) — New York's attorney general is announcing that 47 states and the District of Columbia have reached an $18.5 million settlement with Target Corp. to resolve the states' probe into the discounter's massive pre-Christmas data breach in 2013. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman's office says the agreement announced Tuesday is the largest multistate data breach settlement to date. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Gains for health care companies also contributed. Auto parts companies are falling after weak results from AutoZone and weak home sales hurt homebuilders. ___ Nokia and Apple settle long-running legal disputes HELSINKI (AP) — Nokia and Apple have settled their numerous legal disputes after signing an agreement to work together. Nokia, once the world's No. 1 cellphone maker and now a networks provider after selling its ailing mobile phone sector to Microsoft in 2014, described the pact as "meaningful." ___ Computer beats Chinese champion in ancient board game of go WUZHEN, China (AP) — A computer has defeated China's top player of the ancient board game go, earning praise that it might have finally surpassed human abilities in one of the last games machines have yet to dominate. Google's AlphaGo is due to play Ke Jie two more times this week as well as other top-ranked Chinese players. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91.

Like us on Facebook. Like The Denton Record-Chronicle's Facebook Page SAN FRANCISCO -- Google already monitors online shopping -- and now it's keeping an eye on physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. The internet company said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. Mining credit-card data Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with "incredibly smart people" to ensure it's not invasive. He described the program as "secure and privacy safe." But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. "The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully," Copic said. Google already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. The Mountain View, California, company touted the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. Digital dossiers Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It's all done in a "double-blind" way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can't be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. Google's tool won't work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown -- although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

This surprisingly powerful machine, built by researchers at Google’s DeepMind artificial intelligence lab, also captured so many imaginations in China, the birthplace of Go, where Google says more than 60 million people watched that match from across the internet. Now AlphaGo is playing a Chinese grandmaster here in Wuzhen, China, an ancient city near the heart of the country’s tech industry. The match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie, currently ranked number one in the world, seems like the perfect PR opportunity for a company that hopes to expand its presence in China in the years to come. But it hasn’t quite worked out that way. Related Video AlphaGo Wins First Go Game in China with New AI Architecture On Tuesday, AlphaGo won the first game of this best-of-three match, a litmus test for the progress of artificial intelligence since last year’s tournament. But the audience was limited. Chinese state television did not show the event live after pulling out of the broadcast just days before, according to two people involved with the event. Meanwhile, local internet service providers, which are beholden to Chinese authorities, blocked other Chinese-language broadcasts about half-an-hour into the game. Local news outlets did cover the event, but many readers said the stories avoided using the name Google, apparently under restrictions imposed by authorities. The English-language broadcast from Wuzhen was not affected. The atmosphere surrounding the match couldn’t be more different than the vibe of the contest in Korea, where AlphaGo was the lead story on practically every news broadcast and in every newspaper for more than a week. Dozens of journalists were on hand to cover the event in Wuzhen, but so much of the expected energy was missing, partly because Ke Jie had little chance of winning the match against an improved AlphaGo—and partly because coverage of the event was curtailed by unseen forces. Google chairman Eric Schmidt (right). Noah Sheldon for WIRED The reasons for the apparent crackdown on publicity are unclear, and Google declined to publicly comment on the situation. But it’s no secret that, like so many other American internet companies, Google has a complicated relationship with China. More than a decade ago, the company began offering various online services in the country, agreeing to obey China’s stringent censorship laws. But in 2010, after Chinese hackers burrowed into Google’s internal systems and apparently lifted information on Chinese human rights advocates from Gmail service, the company moved its Chinese-language servers to Hong Kong and lifted all censorship. In return, Chinese ISPs blocked Google’s service. Since then, the internet’s most powerful company hasn’t really had an online presence in the country.

But in China, the politics are never simple. Services like Facebook and Twitter are also unavailable here. Though some American internet companies, such as LinkedIn, have agreed to offer services that obey local laws, the Chinese internet is dominated by local companies, including giants like Alibaba, whose headquarters lies only about 50 miles from the city hosting this week’s Go match. The other subtext: Google and the leading Chinese internet companies are part of a worldwide battle for top AI talent. Engineers at Chinese internet giant Tencent have even built their own version of AlphaGo, a machine that also very much represents the future of AI. Noah Sheldon for WIRED Google worked closely with local authorities in arranging this week’s event in Wuzhen, a historic “watertown” criss-crossed by canals, stone bridges, and traditional Chinese buildings adorned with elaborate wood carvings. The match was sponsored by the Chinese Go Association and the sports authority in Zhejiang Province, which surrounds Wuzhen. “Thanks so very much for having us, for letting us come,” Google chairman Eric Schmidt said during a speech just before the match kicked off. In the weeks before the first game, Chinese state media actively promoted their coverage of the event. But state media pulled out two days before the match, according to two people involved in the event, who requested that their names not be shared—an indiction of how complex the political landscape in China can be to navigate, even for one of the world’s biggest companies. This made for a strange day as the match’s first game played out. Google was holding the event in what seemed like the ideal place—the conference hall that also hosts China’s World Internet Conference, a yearly gathering of major internet companies and personalities. But the game wasn’t really available to locals over the internet itself. When a reporter asked DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis about the restrictions on live video of the event, he said he didn’t know anything about the ban. But he noted just how much media had shown interest in the match. Sixty million people in China watched the match in Korea. Now they couldn’t really watch the one in their home country. In the end, the dynamic isn’t all that surprising, considering the messy relationship between company and country. What’s surprising is that this event is actually happening at all. Go Back to Top.

"I see Uber as one of the stupidest businesses in history," said Mr Douglass. "The probability of this business not going bankrupt in a decade is like 1 per cent." Pointing to the high-cost owner-driver model of Uber's supply side and the almost "valueless" user base, Mr Douglass described the San Francicso-based business's capital-raising style as a "ponzi scheme". SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link I think there's a 99 per cent chance that business will collapse, said Hamish Douglass. Photo: Bloomberg "They've got no advantage over anyone else when it comes to autonomous driving technology. They tried to steal it from Google, they've ended up in court. That whole side of the business is falling apart. It's constantly losing money and it's capital-raising strategy is a ponzi scheme. "All they do is keep increasing their private market valuation and someone always says, I'll put some money up, because next time they raise, it'll be at a higher price." Advertisement The court case Mr Douglass refers to involves allegations by Waymo, the self-driving car division spun off by Google's parent company, that Uber has used stolen trade secrets to develop its own autonomous driving vehicles. The case is currently being heard in San Francisco. "Some of the smartest investors in the world like to show off how they got access to Uber, but I think there's a 99 per cent chance that business will collapse."

Mr Douglass discussed Magellan's heavy exposure to technology businesses, and spent time discussing the onslaught of Amazon on the retail and technology sector. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link After slamming Uber, Douglass praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. Photo: Getty Images Mr Douglass heaped praise on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his ability to grow Amazon to a $US430 billion business after only raising a total of $US150 million. "He's a hero of mine and I think Warren Buffett is right," said Mr Douglass. "He's the businessman of our generation." The probability of this business not going bankrupt in a decade is like 1 per cent. Hamish Douglass Despite his admiration for Amazon's founder, the asset manager remains wary of just how clear the business's rate of return is. Separating the different arms of Amazon - Prime, its content and expedited delivery subscription service; marketplace; and Amazon Web Services.- have kept the asset manager on the side. "I only buy things when I have a clear view of the rate of return," says Mr Douglass. "I've got teams trying to model exactly what that is for Amazon and we haven't got it yet. It's proven hard to work out a proper valuation." But the reach of Amazon's disruption is certain and Mr Douglass mimicked a scenario where he and his "Internet of things connected house" discussed his weekly groceries. "My house is going to tell me when I've run out of detergent and it's going to offer me the Amazon brand cheap product," he said. "While Proctor & Gamble have thirty feet of their products lining Walmart and a 60 per cent market share, Bezos will assault that model. "We are in a time when it doesn't work for investors to think three-to-six months ahead. The disruption in our markets is seriously deep."

And then just a few months ago, they were already piloting the product with some companies, so we knew they were pretty serious about it. Now comes the announcement that it is finally available for purchase, although the price tag may cause some to have second thoughts about doing so. In case you need a refresher on what the Jamboard actually is, it’s Google’s first ever cloud-first whiteboard. It has a 4K display board with touchscreen capabilities and lets you write, illustrate, and collaborate with your team wherever they may be. Everything that’s drawn and written there will automatically be saved to your G Suite cloud so that you can access it anytime and from whatever device you’ve given access to your documents. And of course you need to be on a G Suite plan to access files from your Drive. During the testing phase with companies like Whirlpool, Pinterest, and Dow Jones, the companies agreed that the digital whiteboard helped establish better collaboration among team members. They were also able to give suggestions that Google was able to implement, like better range for secure Wi-Fi network configurations and the importance of high-speed touch in a product like this. The Jamboard is finally available for purchase and you can even choose from three colors: cobalt blue, carmine red, and graphite gray. When you buy one, it already comes with two styluses, an eraser, and even a wall mount. The catch of course is that it costs $4,999. And you also need to pay a $600 annual management and support fee. But if you buy it before September 2017, you get $300 off that management fee for the first year and a discount on the rolling stand.

It seems as though today was the day as the PayPal application has been updated with support for Android Pay.   The update came a bit as a surprise today, as neither Google nor PayPal gave us an official “It’s Here” blog post. Regardless, the update is now live in the Play Store for everyone to download and enjoy. If you want to get everything set up between Android Pay and PayPal, you’ll need to make sure that the two services are linked. In order to do so, you’ll need to perform a few, painless steps. After logging into your PayPal account, you’ll need to open the Settings of the updated application. From there, you’ll see a new “Android Pay” option in the Settings list, which will be marked with a “new” tag to give you a reference point to look for. After tapping that, you’ll be guided through the process to get Android Pay and PayPal connected. You will be guided to create a pin-code which will be used when you’re checking out, then you’ll be asked to fund the account to make sure that your purchase is covered. After everything has been completed, you should see a PayPal Discover card appear in your Android Pay application. If that’s the case, then everything’s done and you’re ready to use your PayPal account to make purchases where Android Pay is available. If you want to download the latest version of PayPal, hit the button below. Once downloaded, give it a try and let us know how it works out there in the “real world”.

Credit: Krisztian Bocsi/Bloomberg Most Popular Google says it wants to rid marketers of their obsession with the last click before consumers buy things. Instead it aims to provide insights about how earlier ad dollars perform in areas like TV, digital video, store visits and search. The tech titan separately said it's capable of showing local store hours, directions and inventory levels immediately after commericals on YouTube. A test last year, Google claimed, motivated nearly a million people to visit Wendy's and place an order for a square-shaped hamburger. (Or some nuggs.) The announcements were among a flurry made Tuesday in San Francisco at Google Marketing Next, an annual event to promote the company's plans for ad products, analytics and its DoubleClick ad platform. To help marketers sift through the search giant's many updates and new offerings, we've compiled several key takeaways from the event. Au revoir, last click? Email campaigns, digital ads, TV spots and store visits are among the many tools that marketers use to reach consumers. More often than not, whatever "touched" a consumer most recently before a purchase gets the credit. That's the last-click paradigm, a reference to a shopper's click on an ad online. The search giant's new offering, dubbed Google Attribution, joins the effort to pull off something more sophisticated. The product uses machine learning, Google said, to assign a weighted value to every different touchpoint along consumers' paths to purchase. The goal is to make sense of ad dollars' effectiveness across different channels and devices. If a consumer's last action before buying something is a Google search, for example, an earlier email campaign may also get its share of the credit. Such so-called multi-touch attribution has been around for years, but Google said its product will be more accurate and faster than existing efforts. It's also free in the version designed for small and medium-sized businesses. "It creates a prediction model that learns by weighting a set of touchpoints on how likely a user is to purchase something," Babak Pahlavan, senior director of product management for analytics measurement at Google, said. "The presence and absence of marketing touchpoints across channels and across campaigns will either decrease or increase the likelihood of a conversion." The service is in beta, but the company plans to release it widely later this year. Google also announced a product called Attribution 360 that does the same things plus some, with an annual price starting at $150,000. That's aimed more at agencies that roll out large campaigns. Clients can inform its results by uploading marketers' own first-party data as well as data from Google's AdWords and DoubleClick. YouTube ads get location extensions Google's YouTube said ads on the platform can now culiminate in details such as local store hours, directions and product in stock. When asked how directions and store hours added up to actual store visits to Wendy's, Dischler backpedaled and said those figures were generated by Wendy's using Google data. "From [Wendy's] perspective, this is a very exciting result," he said. The service will likely make more sense with car dealerships and retailers that sell electronics, Dischler said. In-market audience debuts on search Google's empire was built on the proposition that people searching for something online are prime candidates to see an ad for something related. On Tuesday, Google said it is improving that proposition by letting marketers buy search ads that appear only for "in-market" shoppers, meaning they've previously searched for suggestive terms like "spacious SUV" or "SUV with best gas mileage," for example. The company said it will analyze trillions of search queries across its users to better surface people who are close to pulling the trigger and making a purchase. Google also threw out a lot of different stats. Here are the most interesting three: Each day, Google analytics processes half a trillion data points across devices The company has measured more than 5 billion store visits across 17 countries in the last 30 months. Google's partnerships have captured information about approximately 70% of all credit card transactions in the U.S. In this article: A.I.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today detailed how families can use their Google account to stay connected and in sync with one another. Google already allows people to share media via Google Play Music, Google Play Movies & TV, and Google Play Books. Moving forward, families can take advantage of Google Calendar, Keep, and Photos to manage appointments, tasks, and libraries. For example, the shared Google Calendar lets families keep track of group plans and other events, while Google Keep makes it possible to capture and share ideas with other family members. Shared albums in Google Photos requires only a few taps to push those weekend snapshots to everyone, while YouTube TV allows up to six people to maintain their own cloud-based DVR for online television shows. Google says the new family tools are rolling out to Google Calendar, Keep, and Photos in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New, Zealand, Russia, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. starting today. YouTube TV is available in select markets around the U.S. Families, as defined by Google, support up to six members per household. more info at Google » Related Google Photos Debuts Suggested Sharing, Photo Books Google today made it easier to share photos with others.

BUSINESS Technology Google's artificial intelligence machine AlphaGo just beat the world's No. 1 Go player Google's A.I. defeats "Go" game champ Google's A.I. defeats "Go" game champ Associated Press A computer defeated China's top player of the ancient board game go on Tuesday, earning praise that it might have finally surpassed human abilities in one of the last games machines have yet to dominate. Google's AlphaGo won the first of three planned games this week against Ke Jie, a 19-year-old prodigy, in this town west of Shanghai. The computer will also face other top-ranked Chinese players during the five-day event. AlphaGo beat Ke by a half-point, “the closest margin possible,” according to Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, the Google-owned company in London that developed AlphaGo. AlphaGo has improved markedly since it defeated South Korea's top competitor last year and is a “completely different player,” Ke told reporters. “For the first time, AlphaGo was quite human-like,” Ke said. “In the past it had some weaknesses. But now I feel its understanding of go and the judgment of the game is beyond our ability.” Go players take turns putting white or black stones on a rectangular grid with 361 intersections, trying to capture territory and each other's pieces by surrounding them. Competitors play until both agree there are no more places to put stones or one quits. The game, which originated in China more than 25 centuries ago, has avoided mastery by computers even as they surpassed humans in most other games. They conquered chess in 1997 when IBM Corp.’s Deep Blue system defeated champion Garry Kasparov. Go, known as weiqi in China and baduk in Korea, is considered more challenging because the near-infinite number of possible positions requires intuition and flexibility. Players had expected it to be at least another decade before computers could beat the best humans due to go's complexity and reliance on intuition, but AlphaGo surprised them in 2015 by beating a European champion. Last year, it defeated South Korea's Lee Sedol. AlphaGo was designed to mimic such intuition in tackling complex tasks. Google officials say they want to apply those technologies to areas such as smartphone assistants and solving real-world problems. AlphaGo defeated Lee in four out of five games during a weeklong match in March 2016. Lee lost the first three games, then won the fourth, after which he said he took advantages of weaknesses including AlphaGo's poor response to surprises. Following Lee's surprise victory, “we went back to try and improve the architecture and the system,” said Hassabis. “We believe we have fixed that knowledge gap but of course there could be many other new areas that it doesn't know and that we don't know either.” Go is hugely popular in Asia, with tens of millions of players in China, Japan and the Koreas. Google said a broadcast of Lee's 2016 match with AlphaGo was watched by an estimated 280 million people. Players have said AlphaGo enjoys some advantages because it doesn't get tired or emotionally rattled, two crucial aspects of the mentally intense game.

BUSINESS Technology Google starts tracking offline shopping — what you buy at stores in person Google claims to have access to roughly 70% of U.S. credit and debit card transactions. (May 23, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) Google claims to have access to roughly 70% of U.S. credit and debit card transactions. (May 23, 2017) (Sign up for our free video newsletter here http://bit.ly/2n6VKPR) Associated Press Google already monitors online shopping — but now it's also keeping an eye on what people buy in physical stores as it tries to sell more digital advertising. The Internet giant said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' bricks-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items bought or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. Mining credit card data Google says it has access to roughly 70% of U.S. credit and debit card transactions through partnerships with companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a physical store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with “incredibly smart people” to ensure it's not invasive. He described the program as “secure and privacy safe.” But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” Copic said. Google’s opportunity The Mountain View, Calif., company — a division of Alphabet Inc. — already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. Google unveiled the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting is an opportunity for Google not only to flaunt its new tools, but also to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube. Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn't prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. Digital dossiers Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It's all done in a “double-blind” way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can't be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. When it first described the tracking program to the Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a person who had clicked a digital ad run by the merchant. On Tuesday, though, Google executives emphasized that it won't be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google's tool also doesn't work for cash payments or the 30% of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown — although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

Google is keeping an eye on what you're buying offline in addition to monitoring your online shopping in its latest attempt to sell more digital advertising. The offline tracking of most credit and debit card transactions will help Google to automatically inform merchants when digital ads appearing on its vast marketing network translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store.(Matt Rourke/AP File Photo) By The Washington Post Google has begun using billions of credit-card transaction records to prove that its online ads are prompting people to make purchases - even when they happen offline in brick-and-mortar stores, the company said Tuesday. The advance allows Google to determine how many sales have been generated by digital ad campaigns, a goal that industry insiders have long described as "the holy grail" of online advertising. But the announcement also renewed long-standing privacy complaints about how the company uses personal information. To power its multibillion-dollar advertising juggernaut, Google already analyzes users' Web browsing, search history and geographic locations, using data from popular Google-owned apps such as YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and the Google Play store. All that information is tied to the real identities of users when they log into Google's services. The new credit-card data enables the tech giant to connect these digital trails to real-world purchase records in a far more extensive way than was possible before. But in doing so, Google is yet again treading in territory that consumers may consider too intimate and potentially sensitive. Privacy advocates said few people understand that their purchases are being analyzed in this way and could feel uneasy, despite assurances from Google that it has taken steps to protect the personal information of its users. Google also declined to detail how the new system works or what companies are analyzing records of credit and debit cards on Google's behalf. Google, which saw $79 billion in revenue last year, said it would not handle the records directly but that its undisclosed partner companies had access to 70 percent of transactions for credit and debit cards in the United States. "What's really fascinating to me is that as the companies become increasingly intrusive in terms of their data collection, they also become more secretive," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. He urged government regulators and Congress to demand answers about how Google and other technology companies are collecting and using data from their users. Google said it took pains to protect to protect user privacy. "While we developed the concept for this product years ago, it required years of effort to develop a solution that could meet our stringent user privacy requirements," Google said in a statement. "To accomplish this, we developed a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous." The announcement comes as Google attempts to weather an outcry from advertisers over how their ad dollars are spent. Google is working to move past an advertising boycott of YouTube, its lucrative video site, after news reports that ads for mainstream brands were appearing alongside extremist content, including sites featuring hate speech and violence. Google for years has been mining location data from Google Maps in an effort to prove that knowledge of people's physical locations could "close the loop" between physical and digital worlds. Users can block this by adjusting the settings on smartphones, but few do so, privacy experts said. This location-tracking ability has allowed Google to send reports to retailers telling them, for example, whether people who saw an ad for a lawn mower later visited or passed by a Home Depot. The location-tracking program has grown since it was first launched with only a handful of retailers. Home Depot, Express, Nissan and Sephora have participated. "Google - and also Facebook - believe that to get digital dollars from advertisers who are still primarily spending on TV, they need to prove that digital works," said Amit Jain, chief executive of Bridg, a start-up that matches online and offline behavior. "These companies have to invest in finding the identity of the consumer at the moment when that shopper is at the cash register." Tuesday's announcement gives Google a clearer way to understand purchases than just location and allows it to understand purchase activity even when consumers deactivate location tracking on their smartphones. Google executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people's names and other purchase information, including the time stamp, location and amount of the purchase, into anonymous strings of numbers. The formulas make it impossible for Google to know the identity of the real-world shoppers, and for the retailers to know the identities of Google's users, said company executives, who called the process "double-blind" encryption. The companies know only that a certain number of matches have been made. In addition, Google does not know what products people bought. "Through a mathematical property, we can do double-blind matching between their data and our data," Jerry Dischler, vice president of product management for AdWords, Google's online advertising service, said in an interview. "Neither gets to the see the encrypted data that the other side brings." The tech giant declined to describe its mathematical formulas in anything more than broad terms, citing the patent application. It said the work was based on a 2011 research paper by three MIT scientists, which was funded by Google and Citigroup. Dischler described the modeling as a "revolutionary" step forward for Google and advertisers. He added that users who signed into Google's services had consented to Google sharing their data with third parties. But the company would not say how merchants had obtained consent from consumers to pass along their credit-card information. Google said that it requires its partners to use only personal data that they have the "rights" to use, but it would not say whether that meant the consumers had consented. In the past, both Google and Facebook have obtained purchase data for a more limited set of consumers who participate in store-loyalty programs. Those consumers are more heavily tracked by retailers and often give consent to share their data with third parties as a condition of signing up. Tuesday's initiative enables Google to use transaction data from a much wider swath of consumers than ever before, but the lack of detail on how personal data was being handled caused concern for privacy advocates. Paul Stephens, of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, aconsumer-advocacy group based in San Diego, said only a few pieces of data can allow a marketer to identify an individual, and he expressed skepticism that Google's system for guarding the identities of users will stand up to the efforts of hackers, who in the past have successfully stripped away privacy protections created by other companies after data breaches. "What we have learned is that it's extremely difficult to anonymize data," he said. "If you care about your privacy, you definitely need to be concerned." Such data providers have been the targets of cybercriminals in the past. In 2015, a hack of data broker Experian exposed the personal information of 15 million people.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares115 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually. If you don't see the most recent version on Google Play, feel free to pull it down via APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Voice Developer: Google Inc.

Ryne Hager Nah, it is still missing. abqnm First being able to finally f*n type to assistant and, and now this, the second major release for Google Voice, all in one week? I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Looks like battery, which is a little redundant. WitnessG Is it part of O or is it a rooted feature cause I think it looks nicer than the regular battery icon. Roh_Mish Nope. Rooted feature. davidofmidnight Now if they would put some effort into accurate transcriptions... Adam Margeson Put some effort into? You should hear the quality of their source material. They've come a *long* way, especially the last couple years. Santos Chavez They have, I've had Google Voice for years and it used to be laughably horrible, but it's vastly improved since then. Even the recent Spanish transcription that was added gets 90% of what was said right. andy_o wth, finally added Spanish? Is it recognized automatically? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ That third blurred out face looks so familiar... Ryne Hager He's just some dick from AP comments. hp-fourtwenty multiple account control!!!!!!!!!

Name: Subject: Message: PayPal’s latest update lets it play nice with Android Pay Newsby Williams Pelegrin5 hours ago 1 74 7 Google promised that support for PayPal in Android Pay would arrive “within the next few weeks” when it made the announcement back in April. It has been more than a few weeks, but better late than never as PayPal updated its app to support Google’s mobile payment service. The process is relatively straightforward, but there are a few steps involved. When you open the PayPal app, tap the Settings icon on the top right corner. You then tap the Android Pay settings and this is where you link your account to Android Pay service. From here, you can set your in-store PIN number, select your “top-up” amount, and where you prefer to draw that amount from. See also: Mobile payment service Alipay coming to the US 2 weeks ago To PayPay’s credit, it is transparent about what happens behind the scenes. When you link your PayPal account to Android Pay, PayPal creates a Discover card to use in Google’s mobile payment service. This creates a small conundrum, since your ability to use PayPal through Android Pay at certain terminals will depend on whether they accept Discover cards. Another thing to keep in mind is you are not limited to whatever you choose as your top-up amount. PayPay will automatically withdraw from your bank account to make up for any differences between your top-up amount and how much something costs. The update should be live in the Play Store, though some folks have said they have not seen the option for Android Pay within the app’s settings, so it might be a bit until you see the update on your end.

The development aims to showcase the link between online advertising and in-store purchases. Google has also announced store measurement will be linked to YouTube to measure store visits on the back of people having seen video. The mapping technology has been used since 2014 to measure store visits resulting from internet activity, but will be extended to video for the first time in Australia. It will also be linked to store sales measurement allowing retailers to gauge and predict exactly what customers will buy. “The digital and physical worlds are merging,” Jerry Dischler, Google’s vice president for product management at AdWord said. “We have shown that online advertising is driving consumers into stores. We have measured over five billion store visits globally in 17 countries that were the result of ad clicks. So we measure from a click on a search ad or a display ad all the way through a store visit.” The system not only measures what people are looking for, but can also show them store inventory. It is linked closely to Google Maps, but also monitors WiFi networks and other systems for activity to build a clearer picture of consumer behaviour. “On top of that we also have five million human raters where if we are uncertain whether people are in a store location we ask them and we feed that into a deep neural network and use that in order to get 99% precision knowing someone is in a store,” Dischler said. Google said the new systems will continue to protect privacy, but will give retailers a better picture of the pre-sale behaviour of consumers.   Simon Canning Simon is Mumbrella's marketing and advertising editor.

It's traditionally a software event, so iOS 11, macOS 10.13, tvOS 11 and watchOS 4 should get mentions; but there are strong rumours that we'll see some new hardware too. New Macs, new MacBooks... and maybe a new voice-controlled speaker. Wait, what? Following the success of the Amazon Echo and Google Home, it's widely believed that Apple is going to join the rush of companies producing hub speakers that respond to voice commands. And these devices are not limited to playing music: they can search for information online, tell you the weather or the latest sport scores, set alarms, control smart-home appliances and buy things for you (the last one being right up Amazon's street, of course). Now bear in mind that some reports don't agree with this rumour at all. Tim Bajarin writes: "After talking with Apple executives, I've come away with the impression that they're more interested in turning Siri into an omnipresent AI assistant across devices, rather than designing a single device specifically to serve as a Siri machine." Let's hope Bajarin is wrong, because the rumours suggest the Siri Speaker could be a fascinating product. Here's what we're expecting from Apple's much-anticipated Siri Speaker. Name Siri Speaker seems the best and most widely tipped option at the moment: it's simple and it leverages the brand of Apple's famous and (relatively) popular voice control tech. But there are some other options: Apple Home: All Home-related brands face the problem that Apple has an app called Home - one which controls HomeKit-compatible smart-home devices. Apple may be able to tie the branding together, however. Beats Home: Based on Apple's acquisition of Beats iHome iSpeaker Siri Home Design Google Home and Amazon Alexa have both gone with a cylinder design, and it's believed that Apple is thinking along those lines too. Google Home This belief is mostly based on an Apple patent spotted in May 2017: 'Electronic device with radially deployed components'. It's possible, of course, that this refers to a different product Apple has in mind, or is a deliberate attempt to confuse rivals (not an unknown strategy), or was an olde design that it's since moved on from. Features Notorious (and often reliable) Apple leaker Sonny Dickson has claimed that the Siri Speaker may feature Beats technology, following Apple's acquisition of the company in 2014, and could run a modified version of iOS. It may even feature a touchscreen (a feature notable for its absence from the Amazon Echo and Google Home - although Amazon's Echo Show does include a screen). Like its competitors, the Siri Speaker is likely to offer a range of voice-controlled interactions, from weather conditions to turning on the (HomeKit-enabled) lights. Since it's a speaker, of course, we also imagine music - namely Apple Music and possibly Spotify - will be a big part of the package. Release date The internet hive mind says WWDC 2017, although this may be optimistic. The patent referred to in the previous section has only just been granted (it was applied for in 2015) and there's usually a longer wait than that between patent and product - it's not impossible but would be an impressive turnaround. What's more, when Apple launches a new hardware product we generally expect to see leaked components and factory-line photos from the Asian supply chain: Apple's manufacturing base is so vast and complex that it's simply impossible to keep it sealed up. (Software is different. Even these days Apple often manages to spring surprises there) And we've not seen a dicky bird. Still, WWDC 2016 was when Apple opened Siri up to third-party developers, and it would make sense for this year's conference to see the use of Siri SDK in an upcoming speaker. Previous launch timings make it plausible that Apple could announce the Siri Speaker at WWDC 2017, then release the product in September or thereabouts. UK price As it's not been officially announced yet, we've not got UK or indeed any pricing for the Siri Speaker. Furthermore, this is a new area for Apple, so we haven't got any similar or predecessor product to base our comparisons on. But we can make an educated guess based on the rival devices out there already. Apple has to be competitive, and will most likely price its product close to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. The Echo is priced at £149.99/$179.99, with the cheaper Echo Dot available for £49.99/$49.99, while Google Home is £129/$129. With this in mind, we'd expect the Siri Speaker to cost somewhere in the region of £150 in the UK, or $180 in the US. OUR VERDICT We love the concept and if half the rumours are true this is going to be fascinating product; but it's obviously far too early to offer a verdict. Check back for our review once the Siri Speaker launches. Tags: Apple Share this article Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on Macworld UK and thought you should see it too.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares115 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually.

Ryne Hager Nah, it is still missing. abqnm First being able to finally f*n type to assistant and, and now this, the second major release for Google Voice, all in one week? I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Looks like battery, which is a little redundant. WitnessG Is it part of O or is it a rooted feature cause I think it looks nicer than the regular battery icon. Roh_Mish Nope. Rooted feature. davidofmidnight Now if they would put some effort into accurate transcriptions... Adam Margeson Put some effort into? You should hear the quality of their source material. They've come a *long* way, especially the last couple years. Santos Chavez They have, I've had Google Voice for years and it used to be laughably horrible, but it's vastly improved since then. Even the recent Spanish transcription that was added gets 90% of what was said right. andy_o wth, finally added Spanish? Is it recognized automatically?

Tech giant Google has just made some key announcements at Marketing Next - its annual event where the company unveils its latest innovations for ads and analytics with insights and trends across mobile, analytics, video and platforms. With machine learning as the underlying theme, the highlight this time is 'Google Attribution' - a powered-up version of an existing product that will help advertisers measure the impact of marketing across devices and channels all in one place- for free. An attribution model helps determine how credit for sales and conversions is assigned to the various touch-points in a customer's purchase journey. Explaining that attribution effectively needs to answer the core question of 'Is my marketing working?', Babak Pahlavan, senior director of product management for Google Attribution 360 suite and measurement, in a separate conference spoke about how the new product aims to do away with the globally prevalent 'last click attribution model' which does not give credit to interactions (like display, video, search, social or email), that precede the final click before a conversion. "Existing attribution products are difficult to set up, they lose track of the customer when devices are switched, and they aren't well integrated with other marketing tools which makes it difficult to take action," said Pahlavan, claiming that the entire workflow that could usually take months, has been simplified down to a few minutes with this new product.. So, as Google Analytics, AdWords and DoubleClick Search get united into a single platform, advertisers - in select markets initially, will be able to incorporate Google Attribution data into their automated bidding plans. A paid version-'Attribution 360' which can also provide minute-by-minute analysis of TV campaigns, among other things will be available at the enterprise level for sophisticated requirements. Measurement extended to YouTube video ads In select markets, Google will expand its 'Store Visits' technology to video and enable customers to find local stores directly via YouTube video ads that have location extensions (TrueView), with advertisers subsequently being able to note how video ads are driving foot traffic into their stores. Jerry Dischler, vice-president of product management at Google, said, "Our research suggests that more than 50% of all internet users look for videos related to the product or service before purchase", adding that fast food chain Wendy's had nearly a million visits as a result of a YouTube campaign in Q4'2016. While this feature was already available for search, shopping and display ads, Google says YouTube ads will help marketers get a better understanding of the full path to purchase. Closing the loop "With our Store Visit measurements, we've measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries that were the result of ad-clicks", said Dischler and sharing that Google will now be rolling out store sales measurement at the device and campaign levels, allowing tracking of in-store revenue in addition to the store visits delivered by Search and Shopping ads. Here, foot traffic is measured by combining location data from users (who have opted to share location) on Google's apps and websites with Google's mapping tech. The company has additionally partnered with payment service providers, to track about 70% of debit and credit card transactions in the US and has also enabled advertisers to link their loyalty card data to AdWords He added, "Advertisers who want more detail can link their loyalty data to Google ad clicks," Dischler added, asserting that all these tools follow privacy norms with 'anonymised and aggregated' results. 119SHARES Follow Shweta Mulki Search Tags Google Babak Pahlavan Jerry Dischler:;Google Analytics Google Attribution Adwords © 2017 afaqs!     Related Articles Do these ads make you want to use Google Maps?

Yes No View Results  Loading ... Follow @LethHerald on twitter By Michael Liedtke, The Associated Press on May 23, 2017. This Wednesday, April 26, 2017, photo shows Google's web address, in Philadelphia. Google is keeping an eye on what youâ€šÃ„Ã´re buying offline in addition to monitoring your online shopping in its latest attempt to sell more digital advertising. The offline tracking of most credit and debit card transactions will help Google to automatically inform merchants when digital ads appearing on its vast marketing network translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Google plans to unveil the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday, May 23, 2017, in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) SAN FRANCISCO – Google already monitors online shopping – and now it’s keeping an eye on physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. The internet company said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants’ brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won’t be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. MINING CREDIT-CARD DATA Google says it has access to roughly 70 per cent of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice-president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with “incredibly smart people” to ensure it’s not invasive. He described the program as “secure and privacy safe.” But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” Copic said. GOOGLE’S OPPORTUNITY Google already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. The Mountain View, California, company touted the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting was an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn’t prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. DIGITAL DOSSIERS Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It’s all done in a “double-blind” way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can’t be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. When it first described the tracking program to The Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a consumer who had clicked on a digital ad run by the merchant. On Tuesday, though, Google executives stressed that it won’t be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google’s tool won’t work for cash payments or the 30 per cent of U.S. card transactions that Google can’t currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company’s tracking and control what types of ads they are shown – although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings. 000000 000000 Leave a Reply Click here to cancel reply.

To CNNMoney business culture gadgets future startups To CNNMoney Google expands ad tracking in the real world by Heather Kelly   @heatherkelly May 23, 2017: 9:18 PM ET Google Lens makes your camera smarter than you Next time you see an ad on Google, the company might be able to tell if you went out and bought it in a brick-and-mortar store. A new Google (GOOG) feature can tell when someone who clicked on an ad in search results made a credit or debit card purchase at a corresponding physical store. The tool will give advertisers a better idea of how successful their online ad campaigns are. How does Google know if you bought something at Subway or Aldo? It works with the credit and debit card companies to match up in-store purchases with your online identity. The company has partnerships with companies that account for 70% of credit and debit card purchases in the U.S. Related: Google fights to win back advertisers The credit card companies provide Google with encrypted information about purchases, which Google software then compares to Google profiles of people who viewed relevant ads. Google cannot actually see any of the encrypted data, so it does not have access to identifiable payment information, like the person's name or what they bought. The matches are tallied up in aggregate to protect privacy. That means Google can tell a restaurant their ads resulted in 1,000 people going there to eat and how much they spent, but not share any personal information about individual diners. For all its futuristic investments like self-driving cars, internet-beaming balloons and thermostats, Google is still an advertising company. It relies on ad sales for the majority of its revenue. Last quarter, ads made up $21.4 billion of Alphabet's $24.8 billion in sales. Making the connection between online ads and in-person purchases could be huge for the company, which is competing against companies like Facebook (FB, Tech30) for the same ad buyers. Related: Google starts to prove it's not just a one-trick pony Google is also adding another real-world tool to get more customers into physical stores. It will show information for local stores on YouTube ads, such as hours and driving directions to the nearest store or chain location. In order to know what stores you're close to, YouTube will rely on information from your location history. The company has been using this feature on Search and Maps since 2014. Google announced the tools on Tuesday at its annual advertising and marketing conference in San Francisco. The YouTube feature is well timed. Earlier this year, some advertisers pulled out of YouTube ads after they were shown alongside extremist videos. If the idea of Google tracking real world purchases, even in aggregate, unsettles you, there are ways to opt out. You can log out of your Google Account before using search, or turn off your search history so that it's not saved. You can also use cash to buy your frosty and fries. For the local ad information tool, you can turn off your location history.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET Light Bulbs by Ry Crist 23 May 2017 4:46 pm BST @rycrist Ikea's "Tradfri" line of smart lighting starter kits had us intrigued when we tested the system out recently, but a lack of integrations with popular smart home platforms kept us from recommending them outright. Tuesday, Ikea moved to address that shortcoming by announcing that the Tradfri line will add support for Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit and the Google Assistant later this year. Enlarge Image Ikea's Tradfri smart lighting starter kits are on sale now -- systems like the one on the bottom that include the Gateway hub will work with Alexa, Siri and the Google Assistant later this year. Tyler Lizenby/CNET "Making our products work with others on the market takes us one step closer to meet people's needs, making it easier to interact with your smart home products," Ikea product manager Björn Block says in the release. Adding support for all three major smart home voice control platforms -- Siri, Alexa and the Google Assistant -- would be a significant step forward for the Tradfri line, which markets itself as a simple plug-and-play smart lighting solution designed to compete with established names like Philips Hue. Though the two-bulb Tradfri starter kit actually costs $10 more than the two-bulb Philips Hue White starter kit, Ikea might have an advantage with its Tradfri bulbs -- they're brighter than the Hue bulbs, come in a variety of shapes and sizes (including panels that can be incorporated into Ikea furniture), and start at just $12 a piece -- or $18 for bulbs that offer multiple color temperature settings. Still, Philips Hue White LEDs aren't that much more expensive at $15 each, and they already work with all three of those voice platforms, along with other notable third-party services like SmartThings and IFTTT. Ikea clearly realizes that it has some catching up to do -- adding Siri, Alexa, and the Google Assistant into the equation would certainly help them hit the ground running. There's some question of when and how it will all happen, though. Syncing up with Alexa should be simple enough, thanks to Amazon's open developer tools designed to help third parties build their own Alexa skills for the voice assistant. Google is working to help developers put its voice assistant to work, as well. HomeKit compatibility will be the toughest hurdle because Apple places strict hardware and software demands on its device partners in order to ensure the security of the platform. It's unclear if the existing Tradfri Gateway hub that controls Tradfri bulbs was designed to meet Apple's standards from the get-go. If it wasn't, then Ikea may need to tweak the hardware and re-release the product, as manufacturers like August and Ecobee have already had to do. Ikea's team hasn't responded to my questions about the announcement just yet, but I'll update this post if and when I hear back. Ikea claims that support for all three voice assistants will be live by this fall. Once that happens, expect us to revisit those Tradfri starter kits with an updated review.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 25 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares115 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually.

I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar?

In-market audiences will allow businesses to expand their reach amongst those who have already searched within their category of products and services. Google explains how in-market audiences uses the power of machine learning: “It analyzes trillions of search queries and activity across millions of websites to help figure out when people are close to buying and surface ads that will be more relevant and interesting to them.” Google Attribution Another machine learning innovation that was recently announced is Google Attribution. It brings together data from AdWords, Analytics, and DoubleClick to give businesses a better look into whether or not their marketing is working. Google Attribution will measure data at all stages of the customer journey — from the first touch point to the last click before a purchase. It will then use data-driven attribution, powered by machine learning, to determine how much credit to assign to each stage. Currently, Google Attribution is only available in beta to a limited number of advertisers. The company says it will be rolled out to more advertisers in the coming months. Store Sales Measurement Lastly, Google announced store sales measurement at the device and campaign levels will be coming to AdWords. This will allow businesses to measure in-store revenue earned from online ads. That means businesses will soon be able to use AdWords to track both store visits that were generated from online ads, and how much revenue was earned from those visits.

First, Google AdWords is launching a new beta which allows advertisers to use AMP pages as landing pages. If you’re interested in participating in the beta you can sign up here. Second, Google is speeding up ads served across the entire Google Display Network with AMP technology. As of today, Google says a “significant” number of ads on AMP pages from the Google Display Network will be automatically converted into the new AMP ad format. Google’s new AMP ads are said to load 5 seconds faster than regular ads while still looking the same. So when an AMP page loads, the content and ads should load at the same speed. Between speeding up search ads, landing pages, and ads on the pages themselves — marketers can now deliver an overall faster experience for customers on mobile.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 319 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares533 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares477 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future.

Surprise: we can't. Ke Jie, the 19-year-old professional who currently holds the title as the best Go player on the planet, kicked off his three-match exhibition against Google's AlphaGO AI earlier this week. And the signs weren't good: earlier in the year AlphaGo, under the online moniker "Master", flogged Ke Jie in some speed Go matches and everyone else as well. Someone Is Destroying Online Go, And Nobody Knows Who It Is Right now, there's a player lurking in the depths of the online Go scene that is laying waste to some of the best players in the world. It's called Master, and nobody knows who it is. Read more The Mystery Account Destroying Online Go Was Google's In an update posted on Twitter earlier this morning, Google has admitted that the mystery account "Master", as well as a second account "Magister", was their world-beating AlphaGo bot all along. Read more In an indication of just how much a mark AlphaGo has impacted the world of professional Go, Ke tried deploying some of the moves AlphaGo showed off during its online rampage in January. It's certainly a far cry from the big game Ke was talking last year, where he believed Lee Sedol would wallop AlphaGo 5-0. AlphaGo's victory over Ke, however, was a fairly tight-knit affair. The two were evenly matched in the opening exchange, until AlphaGo's (playing as white) machine learning opted to take Ke's (black) corner in the 42nd move. And Demis Hassabis, a co-founder of AlphaGo's creator Deepmind, told reporters that AlphaGo didn't really have a statistical lead until after the 50th move. But once it took hold, humanity was buggered. AlphaGo slowly extended its advantage until Ke opted to resign, just over four hours after the match began. Another Deepmind employee added during the post-match press conference that AlphaGo was configured primarily to win, rather than maximise the size of its victory, and it played moves to minimise any risk of a comeback. You can go through the match below via the recorded livestream, or move by move here. Ke told reporters afterwards that AlphaGo was "like a god of a Go player", compared to last year when the AI was "still quite humanlike". To make matters even more depressing, Stephanie Yin, a 1-dan professional Go player, added that Google's AI played moves that professionals couldn't anticipate. "Some of the moves that AlphaGo played are not based off our human studies. Those moves completely overthrow the basic knowledge of Go." Ke will have two more chances later this week to restore humanity's reputation against machine learning later this week. The second match will kick off around 12.30 PM on Thursday AEST, with the third and final match kicking off the same time on Saturday.

Reply 0 Chris Jager @chrisjager MOD May 24, 2017, 12:22pm Yeah, but AlphaGO is only a badass at playing Go. That's all it does. Ke Jie can kick its arse at everything else. So can you and me. Humanity wins. Reply -1 Zambayoshi @zambayoshi May 24, 2017, 12:26pm Just as with anything where there is a finite number of possible moves, the AI can calculate the probability of winning based on any given move being made. Instead of thinking several moves ahead, the AI can analyse virtually the whole game in advance. Making moves is merely cutting down on the number of calculations required for possible future moves. The AI can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead. Reply 0 PsychoSmiley @psychosmiley May 24, 2017, 1:04pm And that's why something like StarCraft sounds like a much better candidate for an AI system to flex their muscle. We know there is bots out there that can do some pretty nice micro work in SC but to have a system that looks at the interface and has to play like a person would be a really great test given how complex the interactions and thought processes are in that game.

While Labelle's work has been noted in the queer webcomics community for its frank and powerful portrayals of everyday life for trans youth, the artist has recently become a victim of a targeted attack from online trolls, who have sent her death threats and doxxed her personal information such as her address in an attempt to scare her. What's The Best Burger You've Ever Had? Alex Walker 23 May 2017 11:15 AM I was only recently informed that, by luck or (most likely) by virtue of some promotion, burgers will be arriving in our office today. So for this week's Off Topic, it seems more apt than ever to ask people to dive into their memories. Memories about burgers, of course. Want Kotaku's email newsletter?

AdWords gets Google Optimize & Google Surveys 360 integrations Advertisers will be able to create landing page tests down to the keyword level and deploy consumer surveys to remarketing lists. Ginny Marvin on May 23, 2017 at 6:27 pm More New Google Surveys 360 and Google Optimize integrations in AdWords were among the news announced at Google Marketing Next on Tuesday. Optimize With the Optimize integration, advertisers will be able to create and test landing pages tailored for specific campaigns, ad groups or keywords. For example, a travel site could customize a landing page for the query “family friendly hotels” with a family-centric image of kids playing in a pool and test it against an image of the hotel’s exterior. Tailor/test landing pages targered at keyword level via Optimize in AdWords. Coming in months. #GoogleMarketingNext pic.twitter.com/er5S20Suem — Ginny Marvin (@GinnyMarvin) May 23, 2017 Optimize came out of beta at the end of March. The testing and personalization solution ties in with Google Analytics. Users can drag and drop page elements in a visual editor without having to use developer resources or edit raw HTML. Also on the landing page front, a new landing page report section will be added to the new AdWords interface (which, by the way, is rolling out to many more advertisers now and will be available to everyone by year end) where advertisers can get data on bounce rates, conversion rates and mobile friendliness. New landing page area coming to AdWords UI + Optimize integration for landing page testing via AdWords pic.twitter.com/W7C03fxiYQ — Ginny Marvin (@GinnyMarvin) May 23, 2017 Google Surveys 360 Google Surveys 360 is an paid enterprise-level solution that’s part of the Analytics 360 product suite. Google has a panel of more than 10 million online respondents and fields a million surveys weekly through the Surveys program. With the Surveys 360 and AdWords integration, marketers can target surveys to their remarketing lists to learn more about why those consumers reacted to their marketing efforts, including ads and landing pages. Google does have a free version, Google Surveys, but at this point the integration is for the paid version.

The human side of the equation was Ke Jie, a 20-year-old Chinese player who is unofficially considered to be the best in the world at the ancient board game (though go has no official leaderboard like chess.) He attempted to outsmart AlphaGo through an unorthodox playstyle, but he was shocked to find that the program adapted to his moves and broke out some unsual techniques of its own to claim the first win in the series. "I was deeply impressed," Ke Jie said through an interpreter to Technology Review. "There was a [technique] that quite shocked me, because it was a move that would never happen in a human-to-human go match." © AFP 2017/ Ed Jones Having a Go: China Plans to Challenge Google's AI in Strategic Board Game The game took place at the Future of Go Summit in Zhejiang, China. It has been the subject of controversy, as Google has been banned in China. The state-owned television outlet China Central Television canceled plans to telecast AlphaGo and Jie's series at the last minute. In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue chess computer defeated then-top chess player in the world Garry Kasparov, albeit under controversial conditions. Having conquered the world's most famous strategy game, deep learning computer scientists set their sights on the second most popular. But go is a different beast entirely. Games are often measured by "game tree complexity," or the number of possible games that could be played. The game tree complexity of chess is 123, meaning that the number of possible chess games is a number with 123 digits. The game tree complexity of go, meanwhile, is 360. That doesn't mean it's three times as complex as chess, that means it's 237 times as complex as chess. © Sputnik/ Varvara Gert'e Google's Artificial Intelligence Detects Cancer Faster Than Doctors Before Google and AlphaGo, no go program was a match for a professional go player. In 2015, AlphaGo defeated European Go champion Fan Hui 5-0, the first time a computer program had beaten a professional player before without a handicap.  However, Hui was only a 2 dan (go pros are measured by their dan rank, with 1 being the lowest and 9 the highest.) In 2016, AlphaGo played a more distinguished player: 9 dan Lee Sedol, a South Korean prodigy considered by many to be one of the top five players in the world. AlphaGo beat Sedol 1-4. After the set, the Google team upgraded AlphaGo to rectify the error that cost it the one game it lost. AlphaGo then took to the internet, playing against the Korea's top-ranked players and winning every single one — including against Ke Jie, who AlphaGo defeated three times. However, human players have been found to play significantly worse online, leading to the most recent set between the human and mechanical champions. "After humanity spent thousands of years improving our tactics, computers tell us that humans are completely wrong," said Jie after his online loss to AlphaGo. "I would go as far as to say not a single human has touched the edge of the truth of Go." Jie, and other humans despairing at AlphaGo's seeming surmounting of human players, can take solace in the fact that humans will probably always remain better at Seven Minutes in Heaven and Calvinball © AP Photo/ Virginia Mayo, File Google’s DeepMind Breaks Ground With Best Artificial Intelligence Speech Generator Yet. ...

Google is adding an option to disable all network media notifications on Chromecast and Google Home devices Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 9:51am PDTMay 23, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares213 Chromecast Google Google Home News The addition of Chromecast network notifications probably seemed like a good idea at the time. They allow you to control media even if you aren't the one who started playback. However, you see those notifications on your device even if you're not watching or listening to the content, and you can end up with multiple cast notifications on a busy network. Google is finally making these notifications optional with a toggle that turns off all the network notifications for your Chromecast or Google Home. Previously, you could only disable the notifications on a per device basis. So, each person on your network had to go into their Google settings and turn off the notifications. According to Google's Chromecast support page, there's a toggle in the Google Home app that can disable the notifications for all content at the network level. Casting to the device will no longer produce a media notification for anyone on your network. Here's now you do it... or how you will eventually. Open the Google Home app. In the top right corner of the Home screen, tap Devices to see available Chromecast devices. Scroll to find the device card for the Chromecast you'd like prevent sending cast notifications. In the top right corner of the device card, tap the device card menu. Under Device info, turn "Let others control your casted media" off. Google seems to have jumped the gun a little adding this to the support page. No one on the AP team has this option in settings yet, even those of us in the preview program. Give it a few days and the toggle will probably appear.

This usually saves me when my remote isn't nearby to pause something I'm watching Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bdc26dc659652bf4327d7529629202ff2b4029b31075a2365de69c6365283112.gif Paul_Werner Aw, she looks so sad. It's OK, hopefully Google will fix it... someday. LOL Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I strangely have the exact opposite problem. If I start playing some music on my Google Home and stop it later (or it stops itself), I'll still have a streaming notification sitting on my phone hours later. Sadly because there is no other interface I'll have to leave that device enabled, but I can finally switch off my SHIELD and Chromecasts! Bartek Juszczak I've been on both sides of that. Sometimes the notification is there for hours when it shouldn't be an you can't swipe it away. Other times the notification of the app that's casting disappears for no reason and this one half saves me though not too much cause all you can do is pause. It's all just quite broken Bartek Juszczak Yeah the casting system is still a bit of a broken mess. With a Chromecast Audio I still can't say "Ok Google, play music on my chromecast", it just doesn't work with audio. With Google Play Music I still can't start playback on my computer. Apps disconnect and casting breaks all the time. Notifications get stuck. Different track name is displayed to what's playing etc. Unable to do anything but pause and play via the notification, should be able to skip tracks, change volume etc etc. Sometimes it all *barely* works.

YaKillaCJ The real issue is Google needs to fix the connection issues. Even on stable and great networks, Casting disconnect. Networks where UPnP devices wouldn't skip a beat. We really should have advanced options to refresh rates and option to disable sleep while casting for example. Also part of the issue is the lack of ability to use Casting while offline. I shouldn't have to be online for casting local content. All I'm saying is to fix the real issues and they wouldn't have to try and force annoying notifications to everyone. 4Ui812 I turned this shit off on my phone as soon as they added it. I kept shutting off other people's cast by accident thinking I was the one who started it. boop Seem like it's broken on O anyway Ryan It should have been an "opt in" feature. I cant say how many times my girlfriend would break casting before we figured this out. Bartek Juszczak It shouldn't have been. This means that if my grandparents get chromecasts/cast devices, it will be super easy for them, either of them can pause or control any chromecast at any time, it's super convenient and if it's not on by default they'll never know it exists. What it should be is a pre-selected option during the initial cast device setup "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing." Ryan "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing.", So opt in then? And odds are your grandparents were more likely to constantly just be shutting eachothers casts off like everyone else. Bartek Juszczak Opt-in as in not on by default but can be turned on? This would be preselected as on, if you just quickly skip through the setup it would be on. If you pay more attention you can untick it. Opt in would mean most people wouldn't have it, either because they skipped through setup quickly or because it's unticked by default, so if they're not familiar with it it feels safer to leave it off. And no, a lot of people do use it as intended and not to switch each other's stuff off. Though if the notification said who's casting, had next, previous and volume control buttons, it would be far more useful. YaKillaCJ I disagree. I see it as a nuisance, invasion of privacy, and lacks useful functionality. The very idea is that the device that started the casting is the remote. Not every connected device becomes a remote. I can see and understand its use case but it should definitely have been opt in. Cory S I live alone, so the most annoying thing about these notifications for me is they aren't consistent. I never know if I pull my phone out of my pocket if the damn thing will be there or not. nxtiak I wish we can ADJUST the volume. I have Google Home playing to my Chrome Audio in my kitchen, sucks that I can't adjust the volume of it using this notification. neoKushan It's not just the volume, all you can really do with the notification is pause and stop. I find this incredibly frustrating, if I've got the app installed I should be able to have full control, or at the very least next/previous - you know, basic media controls for your media notification. Cliff Robertson Oh boy. The notifications I blocked months ago will have a setting to turn it off... Shane Hull Blocked it how? trwnh Thank God. Finally. Richard Branches https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9718c51c9544e88fcd9c489ee5cca7dd7feaef70a61d54217bdbdbd76015224e.gif whispy_snippet The thing is, I actually like the feature on my home network. I'd prefer to keep it on. But what DOES annoy me is when I get two cast notifications for something I'VE cast. Has this been addressed yet?

In the first of three planned games in the eastern water town of Wuzhen, the AlphaGo programme held off China's world number one Ke Jie in front of Chinese officials and Google parent Alphabet's chief executive Eric Schmidt. The victory over the world's top player - which many thought would take decades to achieve - underlines the potential of artificial intelligence to take on humans at complex tasks. Wooing Beijing may be less simple. The game streamed live on Google-owned YouTube, while executives from the DeepMind unit that developed the programme sent out updates live on Twitter. Both are blocked by China, as is Google search. Ke Jie competes against Google's artificial intelligence (AI) program AlphaGo Credit: Rex Google pulled its search engine from China seven years ago after it refused to self-censor internet searches, a requirement of Beijing. Since then it has been inaccessible behind the country's nationwide firewall. The ceremonial game - the second time AlphaGo has gone head-to-head with a master Go player in a public showdown - represents a major bridge-building exercise for Google in China, following a charm offensive in recent years. It has announced plans to bring some services back to the country, including its app store Google Play. In March it also said Chinese users would be able to access the Translate mobile app, marking its most recent success launching a previously banned service. Like AlphaGo, Translate also uses DeepMind's artificial intelligence software. A screen shows referees judging after the match featuring Ke Jie against AlphaGo  Credit: EPA Beijing is pushing to become a major player in artificial intelligence. Chinese search engine giant Baidu Inc, launched an AI lab in March with China's state planner, the National Development and Reform Commission. Go, most popular in countries such as China, South Korea and Japan, involves two contestants moving black and white stones across a square grid, aiming to seize the most territory. Its origins date back thousands of years. The board game is favoured by AI researchers because of the large number of outcomes compared to other games such as western chess. According to Google there are more potential positions in a Go game than atoms in the universe. AlphaGo made history when it beat a top South Korean professional player last year. Game over!

The internet company said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. MINING CREDIT-CARD DATA Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with "incredibly smart people" to ensure it's not invasive. He described the program as "secure and privacy safe." But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. "The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully," Copic said. GOOGLE'S OPPORTUNITY Google already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. The Mountain View, California, company touted the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting was an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn't prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. DIGITAL DOSSIERS Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It's all done in a "double-blind" way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can't be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. When it first described the tracking program to The Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a consumer who had clicked on a digital ad run by the merchant. On Tuesday, though, Google executives stressed that it won't be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google's tool won't work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown - although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

See Offers Nation & World Posted Yesterday at 8:08 PM Updated May 23 increase font size Google’s latest tool tracks you from computer or phone to purchases in stores If you click on an online ad, then use a card to buy the product at a physical site, it can let merchants know. By MICHAEL LIEDTKEAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article SAN FRANCISCO — Google already monitors your online shopping – but now it’s also keeping an eye on what you’re buying in physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. Google’s computers will be trying to connect the dots between what people look at after clicking on an online ad and what they purchase with their credit and debit cards at one of the advertiser’s brick-and-mortar stores. For instance, if someone searching for a pair of running shoes online clicked on an ad from a sporting goods store but didn’t buy anything, an advertiser might initially conclude that the ad was a waste of money. With the new tool, Google says it will now be able to tell if the same person bought the shoes a few days later at a physical store. MINING CREDIT-CARD DATA Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By scanning this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. But it could also deepen worries among privacy watchdogs, who are already concerned about the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. The Mountain View, California, company already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. Google unveiled the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting is an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn’t prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. Google is also introducing new ways to help merchants drive more traffic to their physical stores, such as by displaying locations of nearby stores when watching ads on YouTube, something Google already does for non-video ads. Other tools are aimed at giving merchants a better understanding of how digital ads appearing across a variety of devices are affecting their sales. Most of these new analytics draw upon Google’s inroads in “machine learning” – a way of “training” computers to behave more like humans – to interpret the data. Google’s search engine and Chrome web browser are a rich source of data about people’s interests and online activities that it can feed into machine-learning systems. Just last week, Google unveiled new ways that machine learning can help people identify flowers or pull up restaurant reviews just by pointing a camera. Now, Google is showing how it plans to use machine learning to make more money. Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. Google’s new tool won’t work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can’t currently access. Shoppers remain anonymous, meaning they aren’t identified by their names, according to Google. Google gives its users the option to limit the company’s tracking and control what types of ads they are shown – although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

The program beat Ke in the first of three planned matches. Peng Peng/AP Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook In the first of three matches with the world's No. 1 Go player, a Google artificial intelligence program claimed victory Tuesday. It won the round by just a fraction of a point in Wuzhen, China, but the win was enough to leave its grandmaster opponent impressed and thoroughly confounded by the result. Last year, after Google's AlphaGo dispatched human grandmaster Lee Sedol in the notoriously complex board game for the first time, 19-year-old Ke Jie expressed confidence that he wouldn't share the same fate, according to The New York Times. After all, Ke had defeated Lee several times himself. By the match's end Tuesday, Ke felt markedly different about his nonhuman competitor. "Last year, it was still quite humanlike when it played," Ke said. "But this year, it became like a god of Go." His statement feels rather apt considering that, like a god, AlphaGo is its own greatest instructor. Last year, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel broke down the basics of the program developed by Google's DeepMind lab: "It started by studying a database of about 100,000 human matches, and then continued by playing against itself millions of times. "As it went, it reprogrammed itself and improved. This type of self-learning program is known as a neural network, and it's based on theories of how the human brain works. "AlphaGo consists of two neural networks: The first tries to figure out the best move to play each turn, and the second evaluates who is winning the match overall." DeepMind has further developed the architecture of the program since it defeated Lee last year. Also like a god, AlphaGo has been demonstrating its influence far and wide among the game's top players — including Ke, who Wired notes adopted some tactics from AlphaGo. The program played many of the world's top players under the pseudonym "Master" in online matches earlier this year, according to the magazine, and its unorthodox playing style affected Ke's. In a blog post last year, DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis explained what attracted his lab to the ancient game of Go, which has been around since at least the days of Confucius: "[A]s simple as the rules are, Go is a game of profound complexity. There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible positions — that's more than the number of atoms in the universe, and more than a googol times larger than chess." It doesn't hurt that the game originated — and remains very popular — in China, with which Google has a fraught relationship. Roughly seven years ago, the California-based tech giant pulled out of the country, citing discomfort with Chinese censorship requirements. Although Reuters reports that Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet, watched the match in person in China, The Times notes that "there was no obvious live video of the event" available to viewers on the Chinese mainland. Chinese officials don't allow access to Google-owned YouTube, where the match was livestreamed, or to Google search. Yet Google continues to have designs on the massive Chinese market, announcing recently that it intends to bring some of its products back to China, according to Reuters. For now, though, skittish onlookers watching the next two matches between Ke and AlphaGo on Thursday and Saturday might do well to remember Geoff's reassurance: "This program will not lead to a dystopian future in which humanity is enslaved by killer robots.

When Ikea launched its new line of smart lightbulbs in March, the concept seemed promising enough (cheap smart home products from a well-known brand with a high-tech pedigree), but the execution fell short: the bulbs could only be controlled via Ikea's remote or base station. The Swedish home furnishings giant will now rectify that oversight by letting Google Home, Apple HomeKit, and Amazon Alexa devices control the bulbs, according to MacRumors. Ikea's announcement, in Swedish, indicates that the rollout will happen this summer and early fall. Related The Best Smart Light Bulbs of 2017 The Best Smart Light Bulbs of 2017 To add the HomeKit, Google, and Amazon compatibility, Ikea will issue an update to its Tradfri smartphone app as well as the internet-connected gateway, both of which allow you to control the light coming from individual Tradfri bulbs. (Swedish speakers and Ikea watchers will note that the Tradfri name, which means "wireless," breaks from the company's tradition of naming products after Swedish geography). The update is good news for people who want to dabble in home automation but aren't interested in opening their wallets wide. Not only is Ikea's Tradfri lineup cheap compared to offerings from established smart bulb maker Philips (dimmer kits start at $20 and individual bulbs go for $12), but thanks to Google Home and Amazon Echo, it'll soon respond to voice commands like "Alexa, set the lights for bedtime," or "Ok, Google, turn on the floodlights." In addition to bulbs, Tradfri can also control Ikea's LED-equipped cabinet doors, so you could potentially ask Google, Siri, or Alexa to create a mini light show in your living room. Like many other home automation products, Ikea's lights use the Zigbee standard, so enthusiasts can integrate them with the vast ecosystem of Zigbee products like garage door openers and lawn sprinklers.

 Google's AlphaGo takes on Chinese Go master in best of three matches Reuters May 23, 2017, 2:50 AM 63 facebook linkedin twitter email print Chinese Go player Ke Jie puts a stone against Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo during their first match at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen Thomson Reuters By Cate Cadell BEIJING (Reuters) - Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo took on the Chinese world number one of ancient board game Go on Tuesday, the second time it has gone head-to-head with a master Go player in a public showdown. In the first of three planned games at an event in the eastern Chinese water town of Wuzhen, AlphaGo, which is part of Google's DeepMind project, competed against Ke Jie, currently ranked as the top player in the world. Google and its parent Alphabet Inc's services are largely banned in China. AlphaGo, which made history when it beat a top South Korean professional player last year, will go up against Ke Jie in two more matches slated for Thursday and Saturday this week. Go, an ancient Chinese board game, is favored by AI researchers because of the large number of outcomes compared to other games such as western chess. According to Google there are more potential positions in a Go game than atoms in the universe. [http://bit.ly/2q5eogo] The high-profile AlphaGo match comes amid a Chinese government push to compete internationally in artificial intelligence. Baidu Inc, China's leading search firm which is developing projects parallel to Google in search and autonomous driving, in March launched an AI lab in cooperation with China's National Development and Reform Commission. Google pulled its search engine from China seven years ago after it refused to self-censor internet searches, a requirement of the Chinese government. It has since been rendered inaccessible behind the country's firewall, maintaining only a limited presence through a joint venture in the country. It previously announced plans to bring some services back to the country, including its app store Google Play. In March Google announced Chinese users would be able to access the Translate mobile app, marking its most recent success launching a previously banned service. Like AlphaGo, Translate also uses DeepMind's artificial intelligence software. (Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Read the original article on Reuters. Copyright 2017.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About May 24, 2017 Google Home Meets ESP8266 10 Comments by: Adam Fabio May 23, 2017 [Luc Volders] is building his own smart house with the help of Google Home and an ESP-8266. Inspired by the house computers from the TV show, Eureka [Luc] created an IoT ecosystem using a mix of off the shelf devices and open source software. There are about a thousand ways to create a DIY smart home these days. All of them involve setting up a command receiver (like Amazon’s Echo or Google Home), some sort of cloud connection, and an end device controller. This can get complex for the beginner. [Luc’s] article is great because he walks is through each step tutorial style. He even keeps things simple by programming the ESP8266 using BASIC with ESP-BASIC. [Luc] uses If This Then That (IFTT) as his cloud service. IFTT is the glue between Google’s cloud service and the ESP8266 connected to his home WiFi network. Speaking of which, [Luc] shows how to set up port forwarding on the router so all accesses to port 8085 go to the ESP8266. Not exactly strong security – but it’s better than opening the entire home network. You don’t need a real Google home device for this hack. You can build your own with a Raspberry Pi. Once that is set up you can do everything from turning on lights to watering your lawn. Posted in home hacksTagged ESP8266, google home, home automation, smart home Post navigation ← Arise, Chicken, Arise! Run From the Sound of Footsteps in Blind Game of Tag → 10 thoughts on “Google Home Meets ESP8266” Jacob Abercrombie says: May 23, 2017 at 5:19 pm Wait….this has been done, literally hundreds of times. Using IFTTT isn’t something new, getting it to work natively would be newsworthy (IFTTT usually causes some lag, where native integration would eliminate the need to go to an external web server to turn on the lights). Even a simple search on this site shows tons of articles where an esp8266 is used to control a relay, which is essentially what this is. Am I missing something here?

A decent desktop of the era could transcribe several recordings (this was PDA days) of doctor dictation at a time. So, faster than real time. Just…there was this latency between the doc speaking the info and the final transcription into an html-like insurance form clone we created.

Google’s AlphaGo won the first of three planned games this week against Ke Jie, a 19-year-old prodigy, in this town west of Shanghai. The computer will also face other top-ranked Chinese players during the five-day event. AlphaGo beat Ke by a half-point, “the closest margin possible,” according to Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, the Google-owned company in London that developed AlphaGo. AlphaGo has improved markedly since it defeated South Korea’s top competitor last year and is a “completely different player,” Ke told reporters. “For the first time, AlphaGo was quite human-like,” Ke said. “In the past it had some weaknesses. But now I feel its understanding of go and the judgment of the game is beyond our ability.” Go players take turns putting white or black stones on a rectangular grid with 361 intersections, trying to capture territory and each other’s pieces by surrounding them. Competitors play until both agree there are no more places to put stones or one quits. The game, which originated in China more than 25 centuries ago, has avoided mastery by computers even as they surpassed humans in most other games. They conquered chess in 1997 when IBM Corp.’s Deep Blue system defeated champion Garry Kasparov. Go, known as weiqi in China and baduk in Korea, is considered more challenging because the near-infinite number of possible positions requires intuition and flexibility. Players had expected it to be at least another decade before computers could beat the best humans due to go’s complexity and reliance on intuition, but AlphaGo surprised them in 2015 by beating a European champion. Last year, it defeated South Korea’s Lee Sedol. AlphaGo was designed to mimic such intuition in tackling complex tasks. Google officials say they want to apply those technologies to areas such as smartphone assistants and solving real-world problems. AlphaGo defeated Lee in four out of five games during a weeklong match in March 2016. Lee lost the first three games, then won the fourth, after which he said he took advantages of weaknesses including AlphaGo’s poor response to surprises. Following Lee’s surprise victory, “we went back to try and improve the architecture and the system,” said Hassabis. “We believe we have fixed that knowledge gap but of course there could be many other new areas that it doesn’t know and that we don’t know either.” Go is hugely popular in Asia, with tens of millions of players in China, Japan and the Koreas. Google said a broadcast of Lee’s 2016 match with AlphaGo was watched by an estimated 280 million people. Players have said AlphaGo enjoys some advantages because it doesn’t get tired or emotionally rattled, two critical aspects of the mentally intense game.

At Google, there's another way to air your grievance: submitting your complaint to an employee-run message board that's curated into a weekly email. The list, called "Yes, at Google," is a grassroots effort to collect anonymous submissions at Google and parent Alphabet Inc. and communicate them across the company, according to five current employees who receive the emails. "Yes, at Google" tracks allegations of unwelcome behavior at work in an attempt to make the company more inclusive, said the employees, who did not want to be named because they were not authorized to speak about internal company matters. Since starting in October, more than 15,000 employees - 20 percent of the company's workforce - have subscribed, according to two of those people. Google management is aware of the list. "We work really hard to promote and preserve a culture of respect and inclusion," a Google spokesperson said in a statement. "Our employees have numerous ways to raise issues - both negative and positive - with us, including through grassroots transparency efforts like this one. We take concerns seriously and take appropriate measures to address them." This is a great initiative, and adds a ton of accountability into the reporting process for these matters. I wonder if you could complain if your brand new headquarters has every amenity from a huge gym to a massive wellness centre (...what even?), but no daycare.

Updated: May 24, 2017 @ 12:53 am Full Forecast News Sports Obituaries Opinion Buy & Sell AP Business Highlights By The Associated Press May 23, 2017 Updated 7 hrs ago 0 ___ Why Trump's budget plan wouldn't likely accelerate growth WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration's budget plan for 2018 assumes that a mix of sharp spending and tax cuts can both shrink the deficit and fuel economic growth of 3 percent a year — a level it hasn't achieved in more than a dozen years. Most economists and budget experts dismiss that promise as fancifully unrealistic. ___ Trump budget keeps pledges: Cuts for poor, more for military WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise Tuesday, proposing a $4.1 trillion budget plan that would upend Washington in a big way. But he drew rebukes, even from some Republican allies, for the plan's jarring, politically unrealistic cuts to the social safety net for the poor and a broad swath of other domestic programs. ___ Only on AP: CEO pay climbed faster last year, up 8.5 percent NEW YORK (AP) — The typical CEO at the biggest U.S. companies got an 8.5 percent raise last year and made $11.5 million in salary, stock and other compensation, according to a study by executive data firm Equilar for The Associated Press. It's their biggest raise in three years, but pay notably lagged for CEOs at companies where shareholders' protests about executive compensation have been loudest. ___ US says Fiat Chrysler used software to cheat emissions tests DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government says Fiat Chrysler used software on nearly 104,000 Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees that makes them emit fewer pollutants during emissions tests than in real-world driving. The company disputes the charges. ___ Fox News finds itself in an unaccustomed spot — out of first NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News Channel isn't used to losing to its cable news rivals, but was beaten last week by MSNBC. In a more youthful demographic prized by advertisers, Fox finished third to MSNBC and CNN for the first time in 17 years. Fox is trying to establish a new prime-time lineup following Bill O'Reilly's firing ___ Google helps advertisers track spending in physical stores SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google says its new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. Still, privacy advocates are worried. ___ Ford's new CEO promises a fit — but fun — company DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) — Ford's new CEO, Jim Hackett, revealed a little about his plans — and a lot about himself — when he talked to media after his appointment. He spoke of the importance of the company's core auto business, inspiration from his former football coach — University of Michigan legend Bo Schembechler — and the need for a little fun on the job. ___ Target, states reach $18.5 million settlement on data breach NEW YORK (AP) — New York's attorney general is announcing that 47 states and the District of Columbia have reached an $18.5 million settlement with Target Corp. to resolve the states' probe into the discounter's massive pre-Christmas data breach in 2013. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman's office says the agreement announced Tuesday is the largest multistate data breach settlement to date. ___ Stocks claw back more lost ground with 4th straight gain NEW YORK (AP) —U.S. stocks continue to recover part of the ground they lost last week as banks rise in tandem with interest rates. Gains for health care companies also contributed. Auto parts companies are falling after weak results from AutoZone and weak home sales hurt homebuilders. ___ Nokia and Apple settle long-running legal disputes HELSINKI (AP) — Nokia and Apple have settled their numerous legal disputes after signing an agreement to work together. Nokia, once the world's No. 1 cellphone maker and now a networks provider after selling its ailing mobile phone sector to Microsoft in 2014, described the pact as "meaningful." ___ Computer beats Chinese champion in ancient board game of go WUZHEN, China (AP) — A computer has defeated China's top player of the ancient board game go, earning praise that it might have finally surpassed human abilities in one of the last games machines have yet to dominate. Google's AlphaGo is due to play Ke Jie two more times this week as well as other top-ranked Chinese players. ___ The Standard & Poor's 500 index picked up 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite inched up 5.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,138.71. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 34 cents to $51.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 28 cents to $54.15 a barrel in London. Wholesale gasoline remained at $1.66 a gallon and heating oil finished where it started, at $1.61 a gallon. Natural gas sank 11 cents, or 3.3 percent, to $3.22 per 1,000 cubic feet.

Google's been offering family group options (and pricing) for a few of its services, but managing those groups was done individually for each service. Not so anymore. The new Google family group page is where you can see what family group you're a member of - or create one if you aren't in any. Keep in mind that a family group can have a maximum of six members, and you can only be in one of these at a time. Oh, and switching is only allowed once every 12 months, so make sure your family group is actually your family's group before diving in. Over there you'll see that family groups are now supported for YouTube TV, Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos, alongside Google Play Music (which includes YouTube Red) and the Play Store. Family features for Google Calendar, Keep, and Photos will be rolling out starting today in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States. Google Calendar brings a shared family calendar to the table, Keep lets the whole family stay in the loop through shared lists, reminders, and notes, while Photos lets you easily send images and videos to your family group.

We like this definition. The Reimagined Digital Whiteboard for Collaboration in the Cloud Kennesaw, GA (PRWEB) May 23, 2017 Applied Global Technologies (AGT), a full-service audio visual (AV) integrator that designs, installs and manages collaboration environments, today announced it has partnered with BenQ to sell Google Jamboard, a digital, interactive whiteboard for collaboration in the cloud. The 4K Ultra High Definition (UHD) touch-enabled device is aimed at enhancing collaboration in the enterprise workplace. In development of Jamboard, Google set out to redefine meetings, raising the bar on collaborative team creativity and benefiting from the same real-time collaboration found in G Suite. The 55-inch Jamboard fits right into today’s new digital workplace, transforming meetings into an engaging and effective experience, boosting productivity and ultimately improving the bottom line. “We are always looking for ways that we can use technology to help our clients succeed. Naturally for us, as an AV integrator, we typically look towards visual collaboration tools to achieve that goal,” says Mark Cray, CEO of AGT. “Jamboard super charges idea sharing, brainstorming, creativity and planning. Google has done a great job marrying the efficiencies and productivity of tools like digital whiteboarding and G-Suite with an elegant and powerful hardware device.” The fully integrated Jamboard comes in three colors- Carmine Red, Graphite Gray, and Cobalt Blue-and retails at the very competitive price point of $4,999, which includes two styluses and an eraser. A wall mount is also included in the purchase price for a limited time product launch promotion, or end users can purchase a rolling stand for an introductory price of $1,199 (MSRP 1,349) so they can jam on the go between huddle spaces, meeting rooms or offices. An annual $600 software subscription will be reduced to $300 for purchases made before Sept. 30, 2017. Jamboard is available now in the US from AGT in partnership with BenQ.

Forums Join   Google Fiber Arrives in Parts of Huntsville by Karl Bode Tuesday May 23 2017 18:00 EDT Google Fiber today opened the doors to new gigabit broadband customers in Huntsville, Alabama. Announced in February of last year, Google's Huntsville launch is unique in that Google Fiber will be using the city's looming municipal broadband network, which will invite numerous ISPs in to compete under an open access model. Construction of the outer fiber loop was finished up last year, and the city is still in the process of extending fiber to individual homes and businesses across the city. According to a Google Fiber blog post, customers in North Huntsville can sign up via the company's website. New customers can sign up for symmetrical 100 Mbps broadband for $50 per month, symmetrical gigabit broadband for $70 per month, 100 Mbps broadband and TV service for $140 per month, or gigabit broadband and TV service for $160 per month. Users interested in home phone service can add $10 per month to any of those packages. In a statement, Google Fiber was quick to highlight how Huntsville's municipal broadband efforts make this launch relatively unique, and should make this deployment a little quicker than past launches (since much of the infrastructure is already in place). "While we continue the process of building Google Fiber networks in cities like Kansas City, Austin, Nashville, and others, we’re always looking to new approaches to get people connected," said Google Fiber. "Leasing the infrastructure in Huntsville rather than building from scratch allows us to bring Google Fiber to even more people, and even faster."Huntsville Utilities tells local news outlets it has divided its service area into six sections, and chose the north Huntsville region because it's one of the smaller with about 14,000 residents. Neither Huntsville Utilities nor Google Fiber gave any indication about which neighborhood will launch next, though interested users can keep an eye on the Google Fiber Huntsville website. tags: Fiber · competition · business · bandwidth · municipal · consumers · Google · Google Fiber · gigabit News Jump »Google Fiber Arrives in Parts of HuntsvilleSprint CEO Hypes Looming Mergers, Warns of Price HikesForum Topic: Comcast Quietly Launches First 4K DVRVerizon To Launch New Streaming Video TV Service This SummerSenators Ask FCC Why Agency Is 'Manhandling' ReportersWave Broadband Acquired for $2.36 Billion Tuesday Morning Links New Jersey the Latest State to Push new Broadband Privacy RulesT-Mobile Fees are Going Up, Unless You're on T-Mobile OneCable ISPs Refuse to Put Dedication to Net Neutrality in Writing----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 6 comments xrobertcmx Premium Member join:2001-06-18 White Plains, MD xrobertcmx Premium Member Yesterday 9:03 pm The Pricing is Off We pay $76 total for 100/100+TV with FIOS.

The 100Mbps tier would be prefect if it was priced at $30 or even $40. They're kind of doing what the incumbents do with this pricing, making the "value" tier cost just enough to push most people into paying for the more expensive option, even if they don't really need it.

Why can't we have nice things like that in the United States? I don't need more speed as much as I need a lower bill. We already pay more than almost anyone else in the World. Why the fuck does internet access have to keep outpacing inflation? My first cable connection was $30/mo in 2003. Adjust that for inflation and it's roughly $40 today.

(Photo: Marco Della Cava, USA TODAY) 42 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE SAN FRANCISCO — Google already monitors online shopping — and now it's keeping an eye on physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. The Internet company said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. Related: Coming soon to Google Maps: Advertising Google says it has access to roughly 70% of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with "incredibly smart people" to ensure it's not invasive. He described the program as "secure and privacy safe." But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. "The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully," Copic said. Google's opportunity Google already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. The Mountain View, Calif., company touted the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting was an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn't prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. Digital dossiers Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It's all done in a "double-blind" way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can't be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. When it first described the tracking program to The Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a consumer who had clicked on a digital ad run by the merchant. On Tuesday, though, Google executives stressed that it won't be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google's tool won't work for cash payments or the 30% of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown — although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings. 42 CONNECTTWEET 4 LINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Read or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2rR2WRS
Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Pogue The most important announcements from Google's big developers' conference David Pogue May 23, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share If this is May, it must be time for Google I/O. That would be Google’s 10th annual developers’ conference. Like most devcons these days, its primary audience is software writers. But the opening keynote unveiled lots of developments that even non-nerds can understand: new features coming soon to Google products. CEO Sundar Pichai opened his keynote speech with an observation: That Google (GOOG, GOOGL) may have begun life as a search company, but it’s now become an artificial intelligence (AI) company. Examples were everywhere. Google Lens, Assistant, Photos For example, he announced a new technology called Google Lens, which you can think of as Shazam for the whole world. For example, you can point the camera at a flower, a building, a painting, a book cover, a restaurant storefront. The app recognizes what you’re looking at, and instantly gives you information: identification of the flower, ratings for the restaurant, and so on. Or you can point the camera at a marquee of a rock concert; Google Lens offers buttons for Play Music, Buy Tickets, or Add to Calendar. Google Lens is part of Google Assistant, Google’s broader voice-assistant technology. Assistant is built into every Android phone, and is now available as an iPhone app. And you can now type questions and commands to Assistant instead of speaking them, if you prefer. Google Photos, the company’s free, unlimited-storage online photo gallery, has always been able to identify who is in each photo. Now, if it spots, say, your brother in a photo, it offers to send that picture to him. Creepy, but convenient. Google Home Google announced improvements in its Google Home device, too (basically Google’s version of the Amazon Echo). For example, proactive notifications. If the Home learns something that you might find important—a traffic delay for an upcoming appointment, or a flight delay—its ring glows to get your attention. When you say “OK Google, what’s up?”, it tells you. Second, free phone calls. You can say “OK Google, call mom,” and the Home acts as a futuristic speakerphone. It can call any land-line or mobile number in Canada or US for free. (This is not the same thing that Amazon added to its Echo last week—free calls between Amazon Echos or Amazon apps. This is free phone calls to phone numbers.) Finally, Google Home can now send certain of its responses to a nearby screen, like your phone or TV. If you’ve asked for directions, it can throw a map onto your phone, for example. Android ‘O’ Finally, Google announced the availability of the beta version of the next Android operating system for phones. The promised enhancements are almost comically small: a picture-in-picture mode for videos, redesigned emoji, faster startup, notification dots on app icons (like the iPhone does), color text in notifications. There’s also a slimmed-down version of Android, called Android Go, for underpowered, cheap phones used in third-world countries. It uses far less horsepower and cellular data than the full-blown Android. The most important new feature, Google didn’t even mention in the keynote: a new technology that may let Android phones upgrade to new versions of Android without having to wait a couple of years for the cellular company to get its actually together. (Details here.) Overall, it’s clear that artificial intelligence and machine learning are indeed becoming Google’s new focus. Maybe next year, they should call the conference Google A/I.

Or, to put it slightly less melodramatically, from Android to iOS. The company has launched a new website prodding Android users to wake up and smell the coffee Siri is brewing like a digital hipster. Android and iOS are the only two mobile operating systems that matter Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget Apple vs. Android: Buy the Ecosystem, Not the Gadget You love your Android phone and want to buy a tablet. Everyone tells you the iPad is the best tablet, and it really is the best; but you should still buy an Android tablet. Read More . And while Android has the upper hand in most parts of the world, in the U.S. Apple still reigns supreme. Google has been tempting people to switch from iOS to Android Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google Makes It Easy to Switch From iOS to Android Google just made it much easier to escape the clutches of the Apple ecosystem by switching to Android. And making it easier to switch between the two can only be a good thing for consumers. Read More for a while, but now the roles are being reversed. From iOS to Android to iOS to Android Having already launched an app called Move to iOS to accommodate Android users switching to iOS, Apple has now launched a website too. The goal, to persuade Android users to switch to iOS, is the same, but the methods have changed slightly. Because this feels… friendlier, somehow. On its new Switch from Android to iPhone website, Apple asks (and answers) 10 questions. These are designed to gently persuade the average Android user to make the leap across to iOS. In order to do so, Apple explains how easy it is to switch, and extols the many virtues of iPhones. Apple talks up the camera, the chipset, the regular iOS updates, the user-friendliness, the privacy protocols, the Messaging app, Apple Support, and Apple Stores as reasons to switch. It then reveals the fact that 97 percent of iPhone owners are satisfied (or very satisfied) with their devices. If that little lot isn’t enough to persuade you to switch from Android to iOS, Apple is offering up to $260 in credit when you trade in your current smartphone. Oh, and there’s also the set of five new videos revealing why the iPhone is superior to your crappy Android device. Apple Needs to Stop the iPhone Sales Rot This is an admission that Android is now number one Android Now Powers 9 Out of 10 Smartphones Android Now Powers 9 Out of 10 Smartphones The mobile operating system war is now over. And Android won. Because while Apple still sells shedloads of iPhones, 9 of 10 smartphones sold around the world is now powered by Android. Read More . Apple has recently seemed happy to coast along, knowing it has loyal fans likely to stick with the company through thick and thin. Now, it’s actually putting some effort in, which Apple knows it needs to do to stop the rot. Apple is obviously doing very well, with billions of dollars in the bank, and huge profits swelling its coffers every year. However, iPhone sales are down, with Android in the ascendency, so Apple clearly needs to up its game in order to remain in the lofty position it currently inhabits. Do you currently own an iPhone or an Android? What made you choose one over the other? Have you switched from iPhone to Android? Or from Android to iPhone? Why did you switch?Are Apple’s overtures likely to win you back? Please let us know in the comments below!

I actually like ios and apple products but it's more expensive and too much bugs in it. I expirienced good and bad. I have some good ideas that might help apple in this. 1) full support of ios to android programs + ios programs. 2) First product sale a bit cheaper (some discount to anybody who will change from android). 3) To make easier communication itunes makes things difficult for users. 4) to make easier transmition, receiving of ony required files. 5)bluetooth controls to make better working.

In short, they'd need to completely change their design philosophy. Not likely to happen. Reply Dntgvaf kabtifon May 24, 2017 at 6:03 am The ads actually say 'your phone' so Apple still has issues bringing itself to say 'Android'. Also once you switch it's not your phone anymore, it's an iPhone. So don't fiddle with it, don't change anything, leave it to the Apple gods to decide what's cool and what's not. Voluntary servitude to a once was dictator. Btw more Androids are sold in the US so Apple has lost its upper hand there as well. In fact name one market where Apple outsells Android. Even Japan has flipped. 12% of market share is just 2 points away from where Windows phone was...

AdWords Share By Lauren Johnson| 4 hours ago Share A couple of years ago, Google launched a program called Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, to speed up the mobile web. Now, it wants to do the same with two of its most lucrative sources of revenue: search and display advertising. During the company’s Google Marketing Next event today in San Francisco, Google announced a beta test for AdWords advertisers that plugs the fast-loading pages into search ads. Instead of directing traffic to an advertiser’s site, Google is experimenting with an option that directs users to AMP pages. Johnson & Johnson, eBay and Toll Brothers have experimented with AMP landing pages for organic search results. Here’s a video showing the load time of a Listerine ad with and without AMP. The company also said it’s working to build the technology into Google Display Network, which powers ads across 2 million websites. Google also implied in a blog post that AMP pages address advertisers’ viewability concerns. The company claims AMP-enabled ads load five times faster than the average display ad. According to Google, the median load time for AMP pages is less than one minute, and companies have deployed 2 billion pages across 900,000 domains in 18 months. “When ads load fast, people are more likely to see them,” wrote Jerry Dischler, Google’s vp of product management. “That means media budgets work more effectively, and messaging strategies realize their full potential. Fast-loading ads also create better experiences for users.” Google also made a string of announcements about analytics, including a new product called Google Attribution that pulls and analyzes data across AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search.

Google is keeping an eye on what you’re buying offline in addition to monitoring your online shopping in its latest attempt to sell more digital advertising. The offline tracking of most credit and debit card transactions will help Google to automatically inform merchants when digital ads appearing on its vast marketing network translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Google plans to unveil the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday, May 23, 2017, in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google already monitors online shopping — and now it’s keeping an eye on physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. The internet company said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants’ brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won’t be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data [auth] can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. MINING CREDIT-CARD DATA Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with “incredibly smart people” to ensure it’s not invasive. He described the program as “secure and privacy safe.” But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” Copic said. GOOGLE’S OPPORTUNITY Google already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. The Mountain View, California, company touted the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting was an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube. Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn’t prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. DIGITAL DOSSIERS Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It’s all done in a “double-blind” way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can’t be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. When it first described the tracking program to The Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a consumer who had clicked on a digital ad run by the merchant. On Tuesday, though, Google executives stressed that it won’t be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google’s tool won’t work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can’t currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company’s tracking and control what types of ads they are shown — although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Self-Driving Car Firms Form Tangled Web of Alliances For automakers, forging a partnership with a tech firm or buying a promising startup can give them an edge — or a way to hedge their bets in case in-house efforts are falling behind. by David R. Baker, San Francisco Chronicle / May 23, 2017 waymo/ontheroad (TNS) — In the fierce competition to perfect self-driving cars, almost no one wants to go it alone. Big automakers with autonomous vehicle programs have forged alliances with tech companies that, in many cases, are working on the same thing. Silicon Valley companies, which often prefer designing products to building them, have sought out dance partners with decades of manufacturing experience, even as they fight among themselves over patents and personnel. RELATEDWaymo, Lyft Partner to Bring Autonomous Vehicle Tech Into the MainstreamFederal Ruling Stalls Uber Self-Driving ResearchFlorida Bans Local Uber/Lyft Regulations The last two years have seen a frenzy of deal-making. This month alone, chipmaker Nvidia announced a partnership with Toyota; BMW reported an alliance with both Intel and auto parts supplier Delphi; and the ride service Lyft teamed up with Waymo, the self-driving car division of Google’s parent company, Alphabet. For the automakers, forging a partnership with a tech firm or buying a promising startup can give them an edge — or a way to hedge their bets in case in-house efforts are falling behind. “If they perceive this will get them to where they want to be six months earlier, it may be worth it,” said Ed Hellwig, senior editor at the Edmunds.com auto information service. He also suspects it’s a way for the established car companies to show Wall Street that they’re on top of a change that could soon revolutionize their business. “They’re buying some of these companies and investing, if only to change the public perception that they’re not doing enough,” Hellwig said. See a guide to the increasingly complicated web of alliances. Waymo Google kicked off the heated race to create self-driving cars when it first showed off its bubble-shape autonomous prototype in 2010. Now the Mountain View giant has renamed its self-driving effort Waymo and is forging alliances to bring its technology to market. The most fruitful of those partnerships, so far, is with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which agreed last year to integrate Waymo’s sensors and software into specially made Chrysler Pacifica minivans. Last month, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said his company would add 500 robot Pacificas to the 100 already running tests on public roads. Waymo is also asking for volunteers in Phoenix who want to ride the Pacificas on a regular basis. In December, Honda reported that it was in talks to tap Waymo’s technology, although Honda has its own in-house autonomous driving program. And on May 14, Waymo and San Francisco ride-hailing service Lyft acknowledged their partnership, although few details have been released. Bear in mind, Waymo is locked in a bitter legal fight with Lyft’s much larger San Francisco rival, Uber, whose self-driving program was until recently led by a former Google engineer. Lyft and Uber both want to use robot taxis. Uber Uber has been particularly aggressive in its deal-making, although one of the arrangements led to the courtroom fight with Waymo. That would be Uber’s $680 million purchase in August of Otto, a self-driving truck startup founded by Anthony Levandowski, formerly of Google. (In 2013, Google took a stake in Uber, but that relationship soured some time ago.) Waymo has accused Levandowski and Uber of conspiring to steal trade secrets. Uber has denied any knowledge of the engineer’s alleged misdeeds. August turned out to be a busy month for Uber. The company agreed to sell its China operations to Chinese rival Didi Chuxing — which is also developing autonomous vehicles — in return for an 18 percent stake in Didi. And Volvo agreed to build cars capable of incorporating Uber’s self-driving technology, with the two companies devoting a combined $300 million to the effort. In January, Uber and German auto giant Daimler, the parent of Mercedes-Benz, reached an agreement for the ride service to use Daimler’s self-driving cars on its network. Lyft and GM In addition to the new partnership with Waymo, Lyft has another big ally in the self-driving race: General Motors. The Detroit automaker invested $500 million in Lyft in January 2016, citing a shared vision of on-demand autonomous vehicles. Five months later, GM placed an even bigger bet on self-driving technology, buying San Francisco startup Cruise Automation for $1 billion. Cruise has installed its autonomous technology in a fleet of electric Chevy Bolts now circling San Francisco streets on a daily basis. Ford Not to be outdone, Ford Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields announced last year at the company’s fast-growing Silicon Valley lab that it would start making robot taxis by 2021. And in February, Ford said it would invest $1 billion for a majority stake in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh robotics company stocked with veterans of Google, Uber and Carnegie Mellon University. Ford also joined with Chinese Internet giant Baidu last year to invest a combined $150 million in Velodyne , a Morgan Hill company that makes lidar (the laser equivalent of radar) for self-driving vehicles. Velodyne then used some of that money to open a factory in San Jose. Baidu, meanwhile, is also developing autonomous vehicles. Intel and Nvidia Sensing a huge new market for their goods, chipmakers Intel and Nvidia, both of Santa Clara, have been avidly seeking out partners among the automakers. Intel agreed in March to spend a stunning $15.3 billion for Mobileye, an Israeli company whose software interprets images from the cameras now embedded in many cars. And on Tuesday, Intel joined an alliance with BMW and Delphi, one of the world’s largest auto-parts suppliers, to create a self-driving platform. Delphi already has a pilot project to operate self-driving taxis in Singapore. BMW joined with automakers Daimler and Audi last year to buy digital mapping company Here for $3.1 billion. (Intel announced in January that it would acquire a 15 percent stake in Here for an undisclosed amount.) Nvidia formed a partnership with Toyota this month to develop autonomous driving systems. Nvidia already has a long-running partnership with Audi on self-driving technology and supplies chips to Tesla, which has largely avoided partnerships with its self-driving rivals. In January, Nvidia announced a joint effort with Mercedes-Benz to develop a car together in 12 months. ©2017 the San Francisco Chronicle, Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.   RELATED Waymo, Lyft Partner to Bring Autonomous Vehicle Tech Into the Mainstream Federal Ruling Stalls Uber Self-Driving Research Florida Bans Local Uber/Lyft Regulations DISCUSS We invite you to discuss and comment on this article using social media.

The web interface is great, but if you want to be efficient, you’ll unite your Google Calendar with a tool you’re using anyway. Meanwhile, Thunderbird comes pre-installed with the Lightning Calendar. While you can add network-based calendars to Lightning, this calendar doesn’t natively support read and write access to external calendars. Let’s see how you can fully integrate Google Calendar with Thunderbird. What You Need Google Calendar integration requires two Thunderbird add-ons: Lightning (pre-packaged as of Thunderbird 38) adds a Sunbird-type calendar to Thunderbird. Provider for Google Calendar connects Lightning with Google Calendar for bi-directional read and write access. Note: If all you want is read access to a public calendar, you only need Lightning. First, open the Thunderbird Tools Menu (hamburger icon) and under Add-ons > Extensions check whether you still need to install Lightning. Download the add-on/s you need, expand the cog icon, select Install Add-on From File…, browse to the download location, Open the add-on installation file, and click Install Now. To complete the installation, you’ll have to Restart Thunderbird. With Lightning installed, you should see the Lightning Calendar icon at the top right, next to the Tasks icon. Click the calendar icon to open the Lightning Calendar tab. How to Add a Calendar Per default, you’ll see a Home calendar in Lightning.

Select the latter to add a Google Calendar. Add a Private Google Calendar Choose On the Network > Google Calendar to add your own Google Calendar/s or Google Calendars shared with you. Note: The Google Calendar option is only available after installing Provider for Google Calendar. You can still add public Google Calendars using the iCalendar (ICS) format, which offers read only access (see below). In the following window (Locate your calendar) you either have to provide your Google email address, log into your account, and grant Provider for Google Calendar permission to manage your calendars OR — if you have previously done that — you can pick an existing Google session. Once you’re logged into your Google account, you should see a list of your Google Calendars. Check the calendars you want to add, click Next, wait for the confirmation that Your calendar has been created, and click Finish. You should now see Lightning populated with your Google Calendar events. How to Add a Public Google Calendar As mentioned above, you don’t need Provider for Google Calendar to add public calendars. However, you will need the calendar’s iCal address Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar Awesome Things You Can Automatically Import To Google Calendar A calendar keeps every aspect of your life focused in one place, allowing you to worry less and accomplish more. Here are some useful ways to import important information into your Google Calendar. Read More . Let’s say you just want to view one of your Google Calendars. Open the Google Calendar web interface, expand My calendars, click the arrowhead next to one of the calendars, and select Calendar settings. Now look for the Calendar Address and click the ICAL button. Next, copy the ICAL address, i.e. the link ending in .ics. Note: The ICAL ICS link only works if the calendar is public. In the example above, the calendar is actually private. When you’re back in Thunderbird, select On the Network > iCalendar (ICS), enter the Location, i.e. the ICS link, and click Next. Finalize calendar settings, like name, color, reminders, and associated email address, click Next again, and finally click Finish, if all worked out. Google Calendar Integrated Into Lightning And there you go, you have successfully integrated your Google Calendar How to Sync Your Google Calendar with the Windows 10 Taskbar How to Sync Your Google Calendar with the Windows 10 Taskbar Sync your Google Calendar with the Windows Calendar app wasn't always possible. Since the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, you can even manage your Google, iCloud, and Outlook calendars from the Taskbar. We show you how. Read More into Thunderbird. Editing the calendar works both ways, meaning you can add and edit events via the website or in Thunderbird and they will automatically sync in either direction. The Mozilla Wiki has a thorough page covering Provider of Google Calendar, including a section about bugs and limitations. You can also poke your head into the Google Group discussing further questions. For more details about the Lightning Calendar, read Mozilla’s Lightning Calendar documentation.

Required fields are marked * Comment Name * Email * Mark May 22, 2017 at 4:07 pm One small issue with this add-on: It only has options to Sync every 30mins, 60mins or manually Bit of an issue if you are sharing a calendar with someone and you'd like changes to be instant. I'd like a little more control over that. E.g. every 1-5mins Reply Tina Sieber May 22, 2017 at 8:31 pm You could use an alternative extension that opens the Google Calendar web interface in a Thunderbird tab. This will give you live access to Google Calendar. The drawback is that it doesn't integrate with Thunderbird / Lightning / Tasks. Although you could set up both and enjoy the best of both worlds. Stay tuned as we're updating the article; the new version will include this method. Reply Neelesh January 25, 2016 at 7:55 am Wow, You are cool. Thanks Reply Phil Nolan July 23, 2015 at 5:27 pm Google changed their API and now using Provider F's up Thunderbird. Do not install Provider. Reply Tina Sieber May 23, 2017 at 9:46 pm It seems to work fine now. We just updated the article and I experienced no issues while testing the integration. Reply Mickey C January 6, 2010 at 4:47 am All sounds exactly what i need. can someone just clarify once 2 or 3 people have set this up they can all work from and edit the same calendar?? Or is this a simpler request that thunderbirds could do anyway??? Reply Tina January 6, 2010 at 10:58 am Mickey, you can share a Google or other public calendar with several people through Thunderbird if you set it up as described. I wouldn't know of another way of doing this through Thunderbird. Reply Mickey C January 7, 2010 at 1:40 am Thanks Tina, I'll have a pop at it today and see how it goes. Happy New Year. Reply Mickey C January 7, 2010 at 9:02 am Tina, Thanks again. All works fantastically. Is there away to get alerts set up so the people sharing calendars recieve emails?? Sorry, i won't bombard you to much after this. I'll have a play. Thanks again. M Paul G September 5, 2009 at 8:33 am I was SOOO close but it just would not work. All I got was a blank colander. I then found a walk through that showed me a vital link that was missing. If you are having problems, check out bfish.xaedalus.net/?p=239 Paul Reply Dave July 11, 2009 at 11:11 pm could someone clarify: if I go offline, will all my Google Calendar events still show in Thunderbird after a restart? I'm running Vista and searching for a way to have bi-directional syncing with Thunderbird and GCal AND offline access in Thunderbird. Thanks Reply Rob Wales July 7, 2009 at 9:32 pm I have had to reinstall Jaunty and have lost the calendar functionality. I have TB 2.0.0.22 with lightning and Provider for Google Calendar installed just as I previously did but now File -> new -> calendar is greyed out as are all options under the Calendar menu. Also the Calendar list is empty. Please help Rob Reply Tina July 8, 2009 at 1:56 am Rob, when I view >Mail in Thunderbird the >File >New >Calendar option is greyed out as well. Try to open the calender view through >Go >Calendar or click [CTRL] + [3]. Does that work? Once you are in calender view you should be able to create a new calendar through >File >New >Calendar. Good luck! Reply Rob Wales July 10, 2009 at 7:57 am Hi and thanks but no this doesn't fix the problem. I can get a calendar view which shows nothing in the calendar list and a calendar that shows today only and I can't move to another day or view, nor can I create a new calendar. this is really odd as it was humming along before I had to reinstall the OS. Reply Tina July 11, 2009 at 5:43 am I'm afraid I can't reproduce your error amd I'm running Windows. If you have already tried to entirely reinstall Thunderbird with only the necessary plugins/extensions for the calender and if that didn't work, I would recommend to describe your problem in a Linux or Mozilla forum. Eric Nord July 23, 2009 at 10:31 am Rob I have the same problem - it all worked under Hardy, then I upgraded to Jaunty, and no luck. Tina August 5, 2009 at 4:38 am Thanks for providing a potential solution EEE! Hope it will work for everyone. EEE August 5, 2009 at 4:21 am I had the same problem. To fix it I uninstalled Lightning and Google Calender Provider, then reinstalled lightning-extension using aptitude. Rob Wales August 5, 2009 at 3:18 pm Hi EEE Do you have the command line to install by Apt-get? tia NM March 11, 2009 at 2:38 am awesome, worked like a charm! sure I'll find bugs soon, but for now all is golden! Reply Aibek August 31, 2008 at 7:01 am Public calendars are those that are available to everyone or people you specifically shared them with. When it comes to private ones they are available only to the owner. Reply dovetalk August 30, 2008 at 5:53 am Good info. I have been looking for something like this for a while. What is a bit unclear to me is the difference between "public" and "private" Google calendars for those of calendars that are shared, but only between a select group of people. Does anyone know what the difference is in this case? PS. the link to Provider for GC points to the German add-on site. You may want to change it to https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4631 Reply moe August 29, 2008 at 9:07 am Good stuff. Been using this combo for about a year. If you make an entry in either one (GCalendar or Lightning/T-bird), it instantly updates it in the other. Reply Ramesh @ The Geek Stuff August 28, 2008 at 11:56 pm I use Thunderbird on one of my Linux box to access emails from different sources. I'll try your approach to see how effectively I can get Google calendar into Thunderbird. Thanks for putting this together. ~ Ramesh ~ Reply Ivo September 7, 2008 at 11:50 am Hi Ramesh I am an ubuntu newbi, switching from MS windows to Ubuntu. I would like to install this calendar-synchronisation-feature into my Ubuntu. I suppose I need linux compatible add-ons, other than the ones shown here. I this correct ?? and can you give me a hint how to install them in my Ubuntu-Thunderbird ?? Thank you for helping me out !

Google has rolled out additional family-focused features since then, like Google Play Music family plans and separate cloud DVRs in YouTube TV, and now more features are rolling out. Google is adding easy family sharing to Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos. When it comes to Google Calendar, you can easily have a shared family calendar to help keep your family members in the loop about upcoming events. Similarly, Google Keep allows you to share notes so that everyone can collaborate on a grocery list or other notes or reminders. And then there’s Google Photos, which now lets you easily send photos and videos to your family group. These family-focused sharing features will begin rolling out today in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, the UK, and the US. You can point your browser right here to create a family group with up to six members.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares165 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offers to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Carson Saldanha They were mistaken. Artem Russakovskii Which feature specifically? Pedram Haghzaban This post-call messages for failed calls Duder12 Voicemail features will never matter since carriers don't allow them in the US. Richard Riker strange. minsdk is 23, target is 25. Won't install on N (app is not compatible) even when i'm running v9 already. Any dependancy update needed? because no problem with clock from the preview Carson Saldanha Just to confirm, you're trying to sideload it on a Nexus/Pixel device, right? Artem Russakovskii Are you on arm64? Richard Riker uh...totally overseen that. Corey Kinard Is there any way auto post-call spam messages, sent from (detected) spam callers, could be auto blocked and deleted the same way they plan on doing with the verification codes? Rudresh Is this ever coming to non-Nexel devices?

Carlos Rodríguez Midly related, but SMS backups are coming to Nexus devices on O. If you toggle the switch of and on in Settings > System > Backup, a new option for SMS backup appears, just like on the Pixel. Cheers! Lynxy Dear lord, you're right! I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature?

Name: Subject: Message: Sharing is caring with Google’s simplified family sharing for Photos, Calendar, and more Newsby Williams Pelegrin8 hours ago 1 95 9 As Google continues to add features to its wide range of services, the company knows that you might want to spread the love with family members. As such, the search giant announced a “family group” feature that makes it easier to share pictures, notes, and content subscriptions, among others. Family groups are comprised of up to six people, with the “manager” granted administrative duties. In other words, managers can change payment methods, monitor accounts for those under 13 years old, and allow or disallow certain services for certain people. “Parent” accounts do not have such privileges, but they can approve or deny purchase requests and make other restriction changes. The family group feature will function according to the service being used. In YouTube TV, for example, up to six household members can get their own cloud DVR with unlimited storage. Meanwhile, Google Calendar and Google Keep let you share calendars and notes, respectively, with your family group. Finally, you can send photos and videos to your family group through Google Photos. See also: People are using more apps now than ever before 2 weeks ago There are a few things to consider with the family group feature, the first being that sharing is not automatic in Google Keep and Google Photos. You can head to the source link below to set that up, along with Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, Google Calendar, YouTube TV, and Family Link. Also, you can only be in one family group at any given time. You are more than welcome to leave that group and join another, but you can only do so once every 12 months. If none of that is enough to dissuade you, family sharing for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos begins rolling out today in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures. Anthrox give it some time today is the first lunch of software outside of play and play music. software is complex you have many different teams with different goals the family support might be coming after other feature they need to do first makapav Humbug excuses. Just like how after 7 years of phone launches, it's still a difficult problem to solve. Or 15 messaging apps later... Yuri Vidal US Only... =( Kunal God dammit Google!

Most economists and budget experts dismiss that promise as fancifully unrealistic. ___ Republicans gearing up for major changes to federal pay and benefits Advertisement Trump budget keeps pledges: Cuts for poor, more for military WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump fulfilled a major campaign promise Tuesday, proposing a $4.1 trillion budget plan that would upend Washington in a big way. But he drew rebukes, even from some Republican allies, for the plan’s jarring, politically unrealistic cuts to the social safety net for the poor and a broad swath of other domestic programs. ___ Only on AP: CEO pay climbed faster last year, up 8.5 percent NEW YORK (AP) — The typical CEO at the biggest U.S. companies got an 8.5 percent raise last year and made $11.5 million in salary, stock and other compensation, according to a study by executive data firm Equilar for The Associated Press. It’s their biggest raise in three years, but pay notably lagged for CEOs at companies where shareholders’ protests about executive compensation have been loudest. ___ Congress asks: Are federal employees overpaid? US says Fiat Chrysler used software to cheat emissions tests DETROIT (AP) — The U.S. government says Fiat Chrysler used software on nearly 104,000 Ram pickups and Jeep Grand Cherokees that makes them emit fewer pollutants during emissions tests than in real-world driving. The company disputes the charges. ___ Fox News finds itself in an unaccustomed spot — out of first NEW YORK (AP) — Fox News Channel isn’t used to losing to its cable news rivals, but was beaten last week by MSNBC. In a more youthful demographic prized by advertisers, Fox finished third to MSNBC and CNN for the first time in 17 years. Fox is trying to establish a new prime-time lineup following Bill O’Reilly’s firing ___ Google helps advertisers track spending in physical stores SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Google says its new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants’ brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won’t be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. Still, privacy advocates are worried. ___ Ford’s new CEO promises a fit — but fun — company DEARBORN, Michigan (AP) — Ford’s new CEO, Jim Hackett, revealed a little about his plans — and a lot about himself — when he talked to media after his appointment. He spoke of the importance of the company’s core auto business, inspiration from his former football coach — University of Michigan legend Bo Schembechler — and the need for a little fun on the job. ___ Target, states reach $18.5 million settlement on data breach NEW YORK (AP) — New York’s attorney general is announcing that 47 states and the District of Columbia have reached an $18.5 million settlement with Target Corp. to resolve the states’ probe into the discounter’s massive pre-Christmas data breach in 2013. Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman’s office says the agreement announced Tuesday is the largest multistate data breach settlement to date. ___ Stocks claw back more lost ground with 4th straight gain NEW YORK (AP) —U.S. stocks continue to recover part of the ground they lost last week as banks rise in tandem with interest rates. Gains for health care companies also contributed. Auto parts companies are falling after weak results from AutoZone and weak home sales hurt homebuilders. ___ Nokia and Apple settle long-running legal disputes HELSINKI (AP) — Nokia and Apple have settled their numerous legal disputes after signing an agreement to work together. Nokia, once the world’s No. 1 cellphone maker and now a networks provider after selling its ailing mobile phone sector to Microsoft in 2014, described the pact as “meaningful.” ___ Computer beats Chinese champion in ancient board game of go WUZHEN, China (AP) — A computer has defeated China’s top player of the ancient board game go, earning praise that it might have finally surpassed human abilities in one of the last games machines have yet to dominate. Google’s AlphaGo is due to play Ke Jie two more times this week as well as other top-ranked Chinese players. ___ The Standard & Poor’s 500 index picked up 4.40 points, or 0.2 percent, to 2,398.42.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 43.08 points, or 0.2 percent, to 20,937.91. The Nasdaq composite inched up 5.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,138.71. Benchmark U.S. crude oil added 34 cents to $51.47 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, picked up 28 cents to $54.15 a barrel in London.

Spectators watch a video screen as Go player Ke Jie plays a match against Google's artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, during the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen in eastern China's Zhejiang Province, Tuesday, May 23, 2017. Ke Jie, the world's top-ranked Go player, started a three-round showdown on Tuesday against AlphaGo, which beat a South Korean Go master in a five-round showdown last year. (AP Photo/Peng Peng) tech Computer beats Chinese champion in ancient board game of go Today 04:13 am JST 0 Comments WUZHEN, China A computer defeated China's top player of the ancient board game go on Tuesday, earning praise that it might have finally surpassed human abilities in one of the last games machines have yet to dominate. Google's AlphaGo won the first of three planned games this week against Ke Jie, a 19-year-old prodigy, in this town west of Shanghai. The computer will also face other top-ranked Chinese players during the five-day event. AlphaGo beat Ke by a half-point, "the closest margin possible," according to Demis Hassabis, founder of DeepMind, the Google-owned company in London that developed AlphaGo. AlphaGo has improved markedly since it defeated South Korea's top competitor last year and is a "completely different player," Ke told reporters. "For the first time, AlphaGo was quite human-like," Ke said. "In the past it had some weaknesses. But now I feel its understanding of go and the judgment of the game is beyond our ability." Go players take turns putting white or black stones on a rectangular grid with 361 intersections, trying to capture territory and each other's pieces by surrounding them. Competitors play until both agree there are no more places to put stones or one quits. The game, which originated in China more than 25 centuries ago, has avoided mastery by computers even as they surpassed humans in most other games. They conquered chess in 1997 when IBM Corp.'s Deep Blue system defeated champion Garry Kasparov. Go, known as weiqi in China and baduk in Korea, is considered more challenging because the near-infinite number of possible positions requires intuition and flexibility. Players had expected it to be at least another decade before computers could beat the best humans due to go's complexity and reliance on intuition, but AlphaGo surprised them in 2015 by beating a European champion. Last year, it defeated South Korea's Lee Sedol. AlphaGo was designed to mimic such intuition in tackling complex tasks. Google officials say they want to apply those technologies to areas such as smartphone assistants and solving real-world problems. AlphaGo defeated Lee in four out of five games during a weeklong match in March 2016. Lee lost the first three games, then won the fourth, after which he said he took advantages of weaknesses including AlphaGo's poor response to surprises. Following Lee's surprise victory, "we went back to try and improve the architecture and the system," said Hassabis. "We believe we have fixed that knowledge gap but of course there could be many other new areas that it doesn't know and that we don't know either." Go is hugely popular in Asia, with tens of millions of players in China, Japan and the Koreas. Google said a broadcast of Lee's 2016 match with AlphaGo was watched by an estimated 280 million people. Players have said AlphaGo enjoys some advantages because it doesn't get tired or emotionally rattled, two critical aspects of the mentally intense game. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti) Share Written by Dave Pell May 23, 2017 1. Beauty and the Beast Ariana Grande sings the title track from Beauty and the Beast, and that’s an apt headline for the miserable news of a suicide bombing that killed at least 22 people who were attending Grande’s concert in Manchester. The beauty of young people gathering to enjoy music and community was squelched by the all-too familiar, beastly sound of an explosion. ISIS claimed responsibility and the bomber, a British man, has been named. Here’s the latest from BBC and more from The Guardian. + “Like the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, it’s something so horrific in intent and execution that it boggles the mind.” From The Atlantic: The Horror of an Attack Targeting Young Women. + Manchester, United: From Buzzfeed: People of Manchester are responding to the concert attack with acts of kindness. + Some people complained about the security at the venue, but the bomber exploited a common vulnerability. + From President Trump: “I won’t call them monsters because they would like that term. They would think that’s a great name. I will call them from now on losers because that’s what they are. They’re losers. And we’ll have more of them. But they’re losers—just remember that.” + According to Variety, Ariana Grande hasn’t decided whether or not to cancel her tour. Here’s my message to Ariana: Don’t cancel the rest of the tour. Pick up your mic and keep singing, louder than ever. Beastly acts must be met with more beauty, more community, and more music; not less. 2. Liberty from statue Earlier this week in New Orleans, Mayor Mitch Landrieu gave a speech to address his city’s much-debated decision to take down several statues that were seen by many as Confederate monuments. The speech itself is a monument to unity and diversity. “These statues are not just stone and metal. They are not just innocent remembrances of a benign history. These monuments purposefully celebrate a fictional, sanitized Confederacy; ignoring the death, ignoring the enslavement, and the terror that it actually stood for … Can you look into that young girl’s eyes and convince her that Robert E. Lee is there to encourage her? Do you think she will feel inspired and hopeful by that story? Do these monuments help her see a future with limitless potential? Have you ever thought that if her potential is limited, yours and mine are too?” 3. China grove People in China are starting to eat more like Americans. And there are a lot of them. That means China is in a race to avoid a food crisis. And the country’s “efforts to buy or lease agricultural land in developing nations show that building farms and ranches abroad won’t be enough. Ballooning populations in Asia, Africa, and South America will add another 2 billion people within a generation and they too will need more food.” 4. Cache register Advertisers target you online. Later, you make a related purchase at a terrestrial store. Connecting those two things has long been “described as the ‘holy grail’ of digital advertising.” Now, with the help of some powerful algorithms and the data from billions of credit card transactions, Google is trying to successfully make the link. “Google executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people’s names and other personal information into anonymous strings of numbers.” (And besides, when has a giant tech company ever infringed on your privacy?) From WaPo: Google now knows when its users go to the store and buy stuff. 5. Collude conduct Another day, and another damaging story about President Trump’s interactions with intelligence agencies. On Monday, WaPo broke the news that “Trump made separate appeals to the director of national intelligence, Daniel Coats, and to Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, urging them to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion during the 2016 election.” + Former CIA Director John Brennan testifying before the House Intelligence Committee: “I encountered and am aware of information and intelligence that revealed contacts and interactions between Russian officials and U.S. persons involved in the Trump campaign that I was concerned about because of known Russian efforts to suborn such individuals. And it raised questions in my mind again whether or not the Russians were able to gain the cooperation of those individuals.” + WaPo on the White House budget proposal: Trump proposes dramatic changes to federal government, slashing safety net programs that affect up to a fifth of Americans. 6. Bear calls bull “The environmental ministers of Canada and Mexico went to San Francisco last month to sign a global pact—drafted largely by California—to lower planet-warming greenhouse pollution. Gov. Jerry Brown flies to China next month to meet with climate leaders there on a campaign to curb global warming.” As the Trump administration looks to dismantle the Obama environmental record, California has emerged as a key counterbalance, with Gov Jerry Brown maintaining a environmentally-focused course for state: “Erasing climate change may take place in Donald Trump’s mind, but nowhere else.” From the NYT: California Engages World, and Fights Washington, on Climate Change. 7. Happen stance “Still, she couldn’t shake the gap between what she had been told her entire life, and what she felt—that perhaps the story wasn’t true. She and Matt weren’t especially close, but he seemed like the only person she could ask. When Katie was twelve and Matt sixteen, she cornered him. ‘It’s so weird,’ she said to her brother. ‘I don’t remember any of the things they say he did to us.’ ‘You don’t remember,’ Matt said, ‘because it didn’t happen.'” From Maurice Chammah at The Marshall Project: The Accusation. 8. What the struck “My whole body was just stopped—I couldn’t move any more. The pain was… I can’t explain the pain except to say if you’ve ever put your finger in a light socket as a kid, multiply that feeling by a gazillion throughout your entire body. And I saw a white light surrounding my body—it was like I was in a bubble. Everything was slow motion. I felt like I was in a bubble for ever.” From Mosaic: This is what it’s like to be struck by lightning. (These days, it’s also what it feels like to open a bunch of news tabs.) 9. Knowledge font “Typography can silently influence: It can signify dangerous ideas, normalize dictatorships, and sever broken nations. In some cases it may be a matter of life and death. And it can do this as powerfully as the words it depicts.” Ben Hersch on how fonts are fueling the culture wars. 10. Bottom of the news “The brainchild of CEO Jeff Bezos, there are now two stands on its corporate campus staffed with ‘banistas’ led by ‘bananagers’ who give out bananas to anyone and everyone nearby, whether that’s one banana for breakfast or a dozen.” Amazon has disrupted a lot of industries and markets. And it turns out, that includes bananas. + Butter has been making a comeback. And now it’s getting hip. The Atlantic explores “the science behind butter’s subtle variations, as well as its long history as a vehicle for both ritual worship and female entrepreneurship around the world.” + President Trump briefly visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum during his visit to Israel.

A new Google feature can tell when someone who clicked on an ad in search results made a credit or debit card purchase at a corresponding physical store. The tool will give advertisers a better idea of how successful their online ad campaigns are. How does Google know if you bought something at Subway or Aldo? It works with the credit and debit card companies to match up in-store purchases with your online identity. The company has partnerships with companies that account for 70% of credit and debit card purchases in the U.S. The credit card companies provide Google with encrypted information about purchases, which Google software then compares to Google profiles of people who viewed relevant ads. Google cannot actually see any of the encrypted data, so it does not have access to identifiable payment information, like the person's name or what they bought. The matches are tallied up in aggregate to protect privacy. That means Google can tell a restaurant their ads resulted in 1,000 people going there to eat and how much they spent, but not share any personal information about individual diners. In an early test, fast food chain Wendy's was able to see that just under a million people ended up buying food at their restaurants after viewing Wendy's ads in a Google search. For all its futuristic investments like self-driving cars, internet-beaming balloons and thermostats, Google is still an advertising company. It relies on ad sales for the majority of its revenue. Last quarter, ads made up $21.4 billion of Alphabet's $24.8 billion in sales. Making the connection between online ads and in-person purchases could be huge for the company, which is competing against companies like Facebook for the same ad buyers. Google is also adding another real-world tool to get more customers into physical stores. It will show information for local stores on YouTube ads, such as hours and driving directions to the nearest store or chain location. In order to know what stores you're close to, YouTube will rely on information from your location history. The company has been using this feature on Search and Maps since 2014. Google announced the tools on Tuesday at its annual advertising and marketing conference in San Francisco. The YouTube feature is well timed. Earlier this year, some advertisers pulled out of YouTube ads after they were shown alongside extremist videos. If the idea of Google tracking real world purchases, even in aggregate, unsettles you, there are ways to opt out. You can log out of your Google Account before using search, or turn off your search history so that it's not saved. You can also use cash to buy your frosty and fries. For the local ad information tool, you can turn off your location history. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The advance, which enables Google to tell retailers how many sales they created through their digital ad campaigns, is a step toward what industry insiders have long described as the "holy grail" of digital advertising. If effective, the program could help persuade marketers to choose Google's services over the television advertising that still gobbles up the lion's share of retailers' ad budgets. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Google collects massive amounts of personal data from smartphones and desktop computers. Photo: AP But Google's latest move to tie people's digital trails to their real world behaviours is also likely to renew concerns over whether technology giants and their affiliated companies know too much about people's lives, and whether they disclose enough about how they collect and use that information. Google collects massive amounts of personal data from smartphones and desktop computers, including location information from Google Maps and other apps, the search terms that people use in a Google search, and people's web browsing habits. All of that information is tied to the real identities of users when they log into Google's services. Company executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people's names and other personal information into anonymous strings of numbers. The formulas make it impossible for Google to know the identity of the real-world shoppers, and for the retailers to know the identities of Google's users, Google executives said. The companies know only that a match has been made. In addition, Google does not get a detailed description of the individual transactions, just the amount spent. Advertisement "Through a mathematical property we can do double-blind matching between their data and our data," said Jerry Dischler, vice president of product management for AdWords, in an interview. "Neither gets to the see the encrypted data that the other side brings." Dischler, who said the company had been working on the technology for years, described the modelling as a "revolutionary" step forward for both Google and advertisers. But Google declined to share anything more than basic information about how the program worked. Google would not say how merchants had obtained consent from consumers to pass along their credit card information. In the past, both Google and Facebook have obtained purchase data for a more limited set of consumers who participate in loyalty programs. Consumers that participate in loyalty programs are more heavily tracked by retailers, and often give consent to share their data with third parties as a condition of signing up. (Not all consumers may realise they have given such consent, according to the digital privacy advocacy group Electronic Frontier Foundation). The technology giants introduced the use of what it called "double-blind encryption" in these initiatives. Dischler said that users who signed into Google's services, including Gmail, Maps, Google Search, the Chrome browser, or the Google Play store, had consented, during the setup process, to Google sharing their data with third parties. Tuesday's initiative enables Google to use transaction data from a much wider swath of consumers than ever before. Google declined to disclose the names of the affiliated companies that play a key role in handling consumers' data. Retailers that participate in the program don't provide the transaction data to Google directly. They share it with third-party data brokers that encrypt the information before passing it along. Such data providers have been the targets of cybercriminals in the past. In 2015, a hack of data broker Experian exposed the personal information of 15 million people. The tech giant also declined to describe its mathematical formulas in anything more than vague terms, citing a pending patent. Dischler said the work was based on a 2011 research paper by three MIT scientists. That research was funded by Google and Citigroup. In addition to culling data from loyalty programs, Google and Facebook have used location data in their quest to measure whether consumers who viewed an online ad were influenced to go shopping in a brick-and-mortar store. In these cases, the companies roughly determine a person's location — for example, whether they are inside or near a particular store or shopping centre — from GPS or other signals given off by smartphones.

Google is working to make more user information, such as credit card purchases, available to retailers as part of its efforts to show online ad campaigns lead to purchases in retail stores. By Rex Crum | rcrum@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News Group PUBLISHED: May 23, 2017 at 2:21 pm | UPDATED: May 23, 2017 at 2:22 pm Top of the Order:   Google Going Ga Ga: We already know that Google is everywhere. And whether you like it or not, Google knows a lot about you. That’s because the world’s biggest internet search engine is the first place where millions — if not billions — of people around the world go to get information online, and it’s a conduit for many of those people putting in their credit card numbers to buy stuff. And now, Google wants to use all that information to prove that people still buy things at traditional retailers. On Tuesday, Google said it will start taking the information it gleans from credit card transactions to show retailers just how their digital ad programs turned into actual purchases in stores. For Google, the goal is pretty simple: prove to advertisers that their money is well-spent online, and that they should spend more of it with Google, and less on other ad outlets such as television.

For now, Google is saying all the right things about how its data-gathering formulas are so intricate and secure that there will be no way for the company to know who bought what in the real world, only that a person made a purchase. The program may also get people to actually start reading the consent forms that come with their credit cards, and wherever they purchase anything online. Sure, Google once liked to say, “Don’t be evil,” but between its new information-sharing plans and reports about an in-house security team that goes after employees who leak information to the press, it may be hard for many people to think of Google as just that search engine with the clever doodles on its home page.

And you can expect all the late-night drive-thru windows at Taco Bell and Jack in the Box to start doing a booming business among the weed burners of the Golden State, too. But, just because you’re baked doesn’t mean you should get behind the wheel, no matter how good a bag of Nacho Cheese Doritos Locos Tacos sound. And, even stone-cold sober, they do sound good. Well, maybe you should raise a bong in salute of Oakland-based Hound Labs? The company has raised $8.1 million and begun clinical trials of its portable marijuana breathalyzer test. If it makes it to market, the device would be the first of its kind for sale. And the gadget already went through roadside tests with law-enforcement officials last fall. Bottom of the Lineup: The leading U.S. stock market gauges were able to claim a victory, albeit a mild one. The day was also highlighted by reaction to President Donald Trump’s proposed 2018 federal budget, which some referred to as cruel. Others doubted the likelihood of it stimulating large-scale economic growth. The tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index  edged up by 0.1 percent to 6,138.71. The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.2 percent to end the day at 20,937.91. And the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index also gained 0.2 percent to reach 2,398.42. Quote of the Day: “Life is easier on iPhone.” — Apple (who else?). The company made the claim about life improving with the iPhone on a new web page that Apple put up as part of an effort to attract Android users. As part of the campaign, Apple is offering a trade-in of up to $260 in credit for anyone who switches from an Android phone to an iPhone.

Chinese Go player Ke Jie (left) studies the board as a person makes a move for his software opponent. Photo: Associated Press Google’s artificial intelligence program beats Chinese Go master 1 / 2 Back to Gallery HONG KONG — It isn’t looking good for humanity. The world’s best player of what might be humankind’s most complicated board game was defeated Tuesday by a Google computer program. Adding insult to potentially deep existential injury, he was defeated at Go — a game that claims centuries of play by humans — in China, where the game was invented. The human contender, a 19-year-old Chinese man named Ke Jie, and the computer are only a third of the way through their three-game match this week. And the contest does little to prove that software can mollify an angry co-worker, write a decent poem, raise a well-adjusted child or perform any number of distinctly human tasks. Latest business videos But the victory by software called AlphaGo showed yet another way that computers could be developed to perform better than humans in highly complex tasks, and it offered a glimpse of the promise of new technologies that mimic the way the brain functions. AlphaGo’s success comes at a time when researchers are exploring the potential of artificial intelligence to do everything from drive cars to draft legal documents — a trend that has some serious thinkers pondering what to do when computers routinely replace humans in the workplace. “Last year, it was still quite humanlike when it played,” Ke said after the game. “But this year, it became like a god of Go.” Perhaps just as notably, the victory took place in China, a rising power in the field of artificial intelligence that is increasingly seen as a U.S. rival. Chinese officials perhaps unwittingly demonstrated their conflicted feelings at the victory by software backed by a U.S. company, as they cut off live streams of the contest within the mainland even as the official news media promoted the promise of artificial intelligence. AlphaGo — which was developed by DeepMind, the artificial intelligence arm of Google’s parent company, Alphabet — has already pushed assumptions about just how creative a computer program can be. Since last year, when it defeated a highly ranked South Korean player at Go, it changed the way the top masters played the game. Players have praised the technology’s ability to make unorthodox moves and challenge assumptions core to a game that draws on thousands of years of tradition. In the first game, Ke made several moves that commentators said were reminiscent of AlphaGo’s own style. Wearing a blue tie and thick-framed black glasses, the boyish Ke kept things close in the early going. By AlphaGo’s own assessment, it did not have a big statistical advantage until after the 50th move, according to a DeepMind co-founder, Demis Hassabis. Ke, who smiled and shook his head as AlphaGo finished out the game, said afterward that his was a “bitter smile.” After he finishes this week’s match, he said, he will focus more on playing against human opponents, noting that the gap between humans and computers was becoming too great. He would treat the software more as a teacher, he said, to get inspiration and new ideas about moves. “AlphaGo is improving too fast,” he said in a news conference after the game. “AlphaGo is like a different player this year compared to last year.” Go, in which two players vie for control of a board using black and white pieces called stones, is considered complex because of the sheer number of possible moves. Even supercomputers cannot simply calculate all possible moves, presenting a big challenge for AlphaGo’s creators. AlphaGo instead relies on new techniques that help it learn from experience playing a large number of games. This time, Hassabis said, a new approach allowed AlphaGo to learn more by playing games against itself. In the future, computer scientists hope to use similar techniques to do many things, including improving fundamental scientific research and diagnosing illnesses. AlphaGo’s victory represents a marketing success for Google and Alphabet. The Mountain View software company pulled out of mainland China seven years ago rather than submit to the country’s censorship requirements. But it has continued to express interest in the vast market, which has the world’s largest population of Internet users. Notably, the Go match took place in the city of Wuzhen, where Chinese Internet authorities hold an annual conference on cyberspace regulation. China has been drawn to AlphaGo since its victory last year over a South Korean Go master, Lee Se-dol. Officials responsible for technology development in China responded quickly by creating new artificial-intelligence programs and making more funding available to researchers, according to Chinese computer science professors, marking a sort of Sputnik moment for the country. “AlphaGo truly had a big impact” in China, said Wang Shengjin, a professor at the department of electronic engineering at Tsinghua University in Beijing. “Before, we would be discussing how to apply the technology, but it was hard to be clear exactly how to do it, so AlphaGo gave us a vivid example of that.” Still, China showed some skittishness at game time. Despite huge interest, many Chinese became consternated when it became apparent there was no obvious live video of the event online. A site that follows Chinese censorship orders, China Digital Times, posted a translated notice from the government calling for all websites to block the broadcast. “Anything that demonstrates that something special about China has turned out to be just another artificial intelligence problem that Google is better solving than any other company is additionally problematic,” said Clay Shirky, a professor at New York University Shanghai, “because it threatens the specialness of the culture.” The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s main digital censor, did not respond to a request for comment. While AlphaGo had already racked up an impressive record against humans over the past year, the match against Ke offered a final showdown. Like AlphaGo, Ke had beaten South Korea’s Lee in several recent major competitions. After Lee’s loss, Ke had said publicly on Chinese social media that the program “can’t beat me.” Ke’s tone changed earlier this year, after he lost three online speed games to the program. At that point, he said on Chinese social media that computers seemed to be showing that some of what humanity thought about the game was incorrect. Ke will have two more chances to get the better of AlphaGo with games Thursday and Saturday. Most experts do not give him much of a chance. But last year, his rival Lee surprised, winning one game against AlphaGo out of five after a brilliant and unconventional move stumped the software. Paul Mozur is a New York Times writer.

Google will track what you’re buying offline in addition to monitoring your online shopping in its latest attempt to sell more digital advertising. Photo: Matt Rourke, Associated Press Google wants to connect online ads to physical store purchases 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Google already monitors your online shopping — but now it’s also keeping an eye on what you’re buying in physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. Google’s computers will be trying to connect the dots between what people look at after clicking on an online ad and what they purchase with their credit and debit cards at one of the advertiser’s brick-and-mortar stores. For instance, if someone searching for a pair of running shoes online clicked on an ad from a sporting goods store but didn’t buy anything, an advertiser might initially conclude that the ad was a waste of money. With the new tool, Google says it will now be able to tell if the same person bought the shoes a few days later at a physical store. Latest business videos Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By scanning this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. But it could also deepen worries among privacy watchdogs, who are already concerned about the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. The Mountain View company already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. Google unveiled the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting is an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but also to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube. Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn’t prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. Google is also introducing new ways to help merchants drive more traffic to their physical stores, such as by displaying locations of nearby stores when watching ads on YouTube, something Google already does for non-video ads. Other tools give merchants a better understanding of how digital ads appearing across a variety of devices are affecting their sales. Most of these new analytics draw upon Google’s inroads in “machine learning” — a way of “training” computers to behave more like humans — to interpret the data. Google’s search engine and Chrome Web browser are a rich source of data about people’s interests and online activities that it can feed into machine-learning systems. Just last week, Google unveiled new ways that machine learning can help people identify flowers or pull up restaurant reviews just by pointing a camera. Now, Google is showing how it plans to use machine learning to make more money. Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers can collect identifying data triggered by online clicks and match it with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when a digital ad contributes to an offline purchase. Google’s tool won’t work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can’t currently access. Shoppers remain anonymous, meaning they aren’t identified by their names, according to Google. And the company says it doesn’t share any of its anonymized information with its customers; instead, it tailors ads to individuals who fit demographic profiles sought by advertisers. Google gives its users the option to limit the company’s tracking and control what types of ads they are shown — although in practice, relatively few users change such settings.

Pamela Wade: Lock it, leave it, lose it By Pamela Wade 9:00 AM Wednesday May 24, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Opinion Travel Opinion Travellers' Tips There are many ways to safeguard luggage but they are all risky, writes Pamela Wade. Suitcase with a TSA lock. Photo / 123RF So I'm in the first hotel room of a three-week trip, standing looking at my suitcase, ready to get out the essentials, and there's a bit of a problem. That shiny new TSA-approved, swipe-card operated padlock on the zip? The one standing between me and everything I possess in this temporary travel-world I'm in? Turns out the card to open it is back home on my bedside table, a three-hour flight away. Cue deep sigh, sharp recriminations, embarrassment and then I'm into problem-solving mode. Incredibly, it turns out the hotel - can you believe this? - doesn't keep bolt-cutters at reception, and its central-city location isn't well supplied with DIY stores or helpful back-street workshops. Watcha gonna do? Google, of course. Instantly, Google provides the solution, which is itself instant. Demonstrated in a page full of videos, all I need is a ball-point pen, which I insert into the zip, and push. Voila! The teeth part into a grin even wider than mine, I push the padlocked zip-pulls to one side, and my suitcase lies open, all my stuff accessible. But the case is now unusable, you're thinking? No way: all I have to do is pull on the padlock, and the zip fasteners do their usual business. The case looks and functions as normal. And of course, that's a whole new problem suddenly revealed. Because if I can do it, so quickly and easily, so can anyone else with access to my bag on its solitary travels through any airport. They could take out - or, more sinisterly, put in - anything they want, and leave the bag looking untouched. That expensive padlock is mere decoration. Again, whatcha gonna do? Here are some solutions. • Plastic wrap: low-tech, but effective as a deterrent and pretty much standard if you're passing through Johannesburg. But of course you have to have it done each time, there's queuing involved, it costs about $15, and there's not much chance of all that plastic getting recycled. Add that to your carbon-credit guilt. Also, in the US the Transport Security Administration (TSA) people may well cut it off, even before your case has ended its journey. Continued below. Related Content Memphis: Elvis never left the building My holidays: Ahi Karunaharan The smart way to fly • Duct tape over the zip. Even more low-tech, it looks dorky and will eventually leave a sticky residue, but it may be all that's needed to persuade the thief to pass on to more defenceless bag. But TSA people may remove it. • Chain mail: looking as paranoid as tape, it's a sort of metal netting that you wrap around your bag, and could be a signal to the ill-intentioned that there's something especially valuable inside - the eternal conundrum. Also, it still needs padlock closure: TSA-approved if you're heading to or through the US. Google tells me helpfully that there are apparently only seven master keys for TSA locks, and you can view them on the internet, so determined baddies can make duplicates. If you're not US-bound, of course, you can use a regular padlock. Just be aware that combination locks, with enough time, aren't impregnable either. Someone once opened for me a 3-digit lock in less than half an hour, just by methodically working through the sequences (it was a long, boring bus trip). • Suitcase straps for an extra layer of deterrent protection. Unfortunately, zips can still be opened for opportunistic groping; and the strap catches are also TSA-type - see above. • Devices to lock the padlock to the handle, so it can't be slid along to close the zip again. Of course, the zip can be opened in the first place, leaving your remaining belongings to spill out. • Suitcases with double-toothed zips that claim to be impregnable to ballpoint penetration: these are, naturally, expensive. And you'll still need TSA-approved locks if you're flying through the US. Bit of a theme developing here, isn't there? • Hard-shell suitcases (generally more robust anyway) which don't have zips. Catches seem a bit retro, but they work perfectly well and are impervious to ballpoints. The inbuilt locks will, again, be TSA-type however, so one of those seven keys will still open it. It is, at the very least, ironic that demands of the US Transport Security Administration result in less security for your luggage. Don't be tempted, however, to think that with all those bags swirling through US airports, your more secure non-TSA padlock won't be noticed. These guys are obsessive, and will blithely cut it off, leaving your case unprotected for the rest of its journey. Incidentally, they do open some locks to check suspicious contents: I've arrived home to find an unexpected little billet-doux inside my case from the inspectors. There is no ultimate solution, it seems, other than packing your valuables in your carry-on bag and, for your check-in suitcase, using whichever deterrent you can afford and/or live with. Then cross your fingers. - NZ Herald By Pamela Wade Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Explore destinations Africa Antarctica Arctic Asia Australia Caribbean Central America Europe Middle East New Zealand North America Pacific South America Find destinations   This form requires javascript.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares165 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offers to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Pedram Haghzaban This post-call messages for failed calls Duder12 Voicemail features will never matter since carriers don't allow them in the US. Richard Riker strange. minsdk is 23, target is 25.

Artem Russakovskii Are you on arm64? Richard Riker uh...totally overseen that. Corey Kinard Is there any way auto post-call spam messages, sent from (detected) spam callers, could be auto blocked and deleted the same way they plan on doing with the verification codes?

If you toggle the switch of and on in Settings > System > Backup, a new option for SMS backup appears, just like on the Pixel. Cheers! Lynxy Dear lord, you're right! I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature?

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares477 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

TechGuy22 LOL 4Ui812 Google hangouts ... The only place where people never hanged out . cadtek91 *hung Ryne Hager Dunno, don't remember seeing anyone get hanged either. Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google is making it easier to deploy Chrome browser in the enterprise -2 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav May 23, 2017 at 21:30 GMT10 hours ago Today, Google announced new tools to make it easier for IT admins to deploy and manage Chrome within their organization. Google is calling it the new Chrome enterprise bundle and it will include multiple tools in a single download that IT admins need for a simple, managed Chrome deployment. It contains the latest version of the Chrome MSI, the Chrome Legacy Browser Support (LBS) extension as well as administrative policy templates. The Chrome Legacy Browser Support (LBS) extension allows IT administrators to configure their employees’ desktops so that when someone clicks a link to legacy web applications in Chrome that require older versions of IE due to the use of outdated plugins such as Silverlight and ActiveX, the URL will seamlessly open in a legacy browser. When they’re done with the legacy app and type in other URLs that are not specified by the admin, LBS will switch the user back to Chrome to ensure they remain secure. Google is also now offering support for IT admins 24 hours a day. G Suite customers can make use of this support for free and it is available on a for-fee basis for non-G Suite customers.

Google is keeping an eye on what you’re buying offline in addition to monitoring your online shopping in its latest attempt to sell more digital advertising. The offline tracking of most credit and debit card transactions will help Google to automatically inform merchants when digital ads appearing on its vast marketing network translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Google plans to unveil the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday, May 23, 2017, in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Google helps advertisers track spending in physical stores Last Modified: Tuesday, May 23, 2017 4:33 PM By The Associated Press SAN FRANCISCO— Google already monitors online shopping — and now it's keeping an eye on physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. The internet company said Tuesday that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants' brick-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won't be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. MINING CREDIT-CARD DATA Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google's senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with "incredibly smart people" to ensure it's not invasive. He described the program as "secure and privacy safe." But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. "The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully," Copic said. GOOGLE'S OPPORTUNITY Google already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. The Mountain View, California, company touted the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting was an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn't prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. DIGITAL DOSSIERS Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers rely primarily on log-in information, such as email addresses, to identify the people clicking on ads. It then matches that data with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when digital ads contribute to an offline purchase. It's all done in a "double-blind" way, Ramaswamy said, meaning the personal information that Google has can't be seen by merchants or its credit and debit card partners. By the same token, Google is blocked from seeing personal information held by its partners. When it first described the tracking program to The Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a consumer who had clicked on a digital ad run by the merchant. On Tuesday, though, Google executives stressed that it won't be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google's tool won't work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown — although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Scrolling mobile web pages in Safari is about to… Scrolling mobile web pages in Safari is about to get a whole lot smoother By Jon Martindale — May 23, 2017 10:31 am Subscribe Share Jeffrey Van Camp / Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Scrolling across iOS and Safari should be much more uniform in the future, but not everyone is happy with Google's hand in it. Apple is making changes to the way the Safari mobile browser operates in order to make scrolling smoother, regardless of the website being viewed. As it stands, certain sites can scroll a little differently depending on whether they use Google’s accelerated mobile pages (AMP) system. Although Google’s AMP system is supposed to speed up page navigation and scrolling, it’s not something everyone is happy with. Daring Fireball’s Jon Gruber bashed the system on a Hacker News post. This lead to a member of the AMP team commenting about the scrolling disparity in Safari. They claimed to be aware of the issue and that they had actually spoken to Apple about it. Better yet, the Cupertino, California-based company listened. Instead of taking the AMP team’s suggestion that it make scrolling on AMP sites the same as those on regular sites, it’s pledged to do the opposite. As Engadget explains, the reason is that Google’s AMP scrolling in Safari is actually far closer to how scrolling works in other aspects of iOS, due to a deliberate design decision in Safari made some time ago. That decision is no longer relevant, so Apple is now looking to make scrolling faster and smoother across all websites, regardless of their AMP implementation. This is likely to be a mixed bag of an announcement for iOS users. While a unified scrolling experience is much less confusing for the average user and AMP has its fans, there are others who don’t like the way it operates. AMP currently breaks a few features on Safari, such as auto-scrolling at certain taps and automatically hiding top and bottom bars. Certain developers don’t like the way that Google has control of such an important part of the iOS ecosystem either, but with Apple planning to make AMP-like changes to Safari, they may have to accept that moving forward. Apple is expected to implement the new, AMP-like scrolling officially in the next Safari mobile release.
Digital Trends Home > Computing > Google’s Jamboard to begin competing with… Google’s Jamboard to begin competing with Microsoft’s Surface Hub in May Google's Jamboard will pull your teams together, no matter where they are By Mark Coppock — Updated May 23, 2017 11:32 am Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you You now have another option in enterprise collaborative whiteboards with the Google Jamboard. Microsoft’s Surface Hub collaborative whiteboard has been available for purchase since July 2015, with 55-inch and 80-inch models actually shipping in March 2016. The Surface Hub has sold more units than Microsoft expected, and Google decided to jump into that market with its own whimsically named Jamboard announced in October 2016. The Jamboard was originally expected to cost $6,000 for a 55-inch model when it shipped sometime in 2017. Google announced at its Google Cloud Next ’17 event that the Jamboard will arrive in May 2017, and will actually be priced at $5,000, as Engadget reported. Today, May 23, 2017, Google announced that the Jamboard is available for purchase in the U.S. for $4,999. Google’s whiteboard uses a 55-inch display at 4K (4,096 x 2,160) resolution, with a soft-touch plastic touchscreen panel capable of picking up 16 touch points at once with support for an optional Bluetooth rubber-tipped stylus. That’s a higher resolution than the 55-inch Surface Hub’s Full HD (1,920 x 1,080), but Microsoft’s product supports 100 touch points at a time. The Jamboard is available in three colors; cobalt blue, carmine red, and graphite grey. The Jamboard connects via HDMI and sports a built-in camera, speakers, and wheeled custom stand for customers who don’t opt to mount the whiteboard. Google has also packed in Chromecast support, meaning the Jamboard can easily mirror a remote device’s screen or stream content from YouTube, Netflix, and other Chromecast-enabled apps and services. Customer feedback compelled Google to add additional secure Wi-Fi network configurations, and Google implemented the Nvidia Jetson TXI embedded computer to ensure a more responsive touchscreen experience. Android is at the heart of the Jamboard, although it’s a highly customized version that’s been optimized for the whiteboard’s large display and collaborative features. Add-on functionality includes “jam session” whiteboard spaces allowing users to sketch, draw, type, and scribble with handwriting recognition on or off. Images can be imported, a miniature web browser is available, and Jamboards can connect and communicate to enable multiple users to sketch from multiple locations. Of course, collaboration is at the heart of the Jamboard. Google Hangouts provides chat capabilities, and iOS and Android apps let coworkers view sessions as well as add photos, drawings, and sticky notes. The G Suite productivity apps area also integrated, and a G Suite plan is required to use the Jamboard. Google is offering some add-ons for the Jamboard as well. There is an annual management and support fee that is $300 a year if purchased before September 30, 2017 and $600 a year afterward. A rolling stand accessory is also available to make the Jamboard a more portable solution, and that has a promotional price of $1,199 through September 30, 2017 and then $1,349 thereafter. The Jamboard will be available to G Suite customers in the U.S. first and then will roll out to the U.K. and Canada over the summer with other countries getting the solution over time. With cloud services growing by leaps and bounds, and organizations obviously attracted to digital whiteboard solutions that allow teams to work together across global distances, whiteboard solutions like the Jamboard and Microsoft’s Surface Hub are becoming popular. Now, Google will be able to take Microsoft on directly in this increasingly lucrative space. Updated on 5-23-2017 by Mark Coppock: Indicated that the product is now available for purchase in the U.S. and clarified a few technical points.

I don’t mean that metaphorically, either: the question of where a user in a virtual world is physically, and how they’re interacting with the real world around them, is arguably the key to making the next generation of headsets. It’s something not only big names like Google and Apple are working on, but VR/AR specialists like Occipital. The San Francisco company isn’t new, but you’d be forgiven for not having necessary heard of it. For the past few years Occipital has been working on sensor technology that can map out a space in real-time, without relying on GPS or resorting to adhesive markers or beacons. That resulted in the Structure Sensor, an $379 iPad accessory that turns Apple’s tablet into a room-mapping 3D scanner. Now, the technology has advanced again, now mounted atop a mixed reality headset. Dubbed Bridge, it adopts the same strategy as Google Cardboard, Daydream, and Samsung Gear VR by putting a smartphone at its heart. However, though the iPhone Bridge is designed to accommodate does make use of its camera, the really clever stuff comes from the Structure Sensor mounted on the top and plugged in via Lightning. When I sat down with Occipital, the team was just preparing to ship its second batch of preorders. Sales of the so-called Bridge Explorer Edition had shipped in December to the early-adopters. Now, a new version – complete with 6-degree-of-freedom (6DoF) tracking and a brand new 3DoF controller – is headed out to developers eager to try Occipital’s Bridge Engine. The system is a one-two punch of hardware and software. The former distinguishes itself from other phone-based headsets by virtue of how it integrate’s the iPhone’s own abilities with external sensors. A wide-angle lens atop the phone’s camera can feed live video from the room around you into the headset for augmented reality (and, bluntly, so that you don’t bump into anything). However, Occipital is also using data from its own depth sensor to create a 3D view from that single wide-angle feed. The result is a slightly offset view served up to each eye, helping with binocular vision. In the process, Bridge also adjusts for the iPhone’s offset camera, so that your perceived view of the room around is from where your pupils actually are, not offset like the camera itself is seeing. It’s important, since Occipital isn’t just targeting virtual reality like Gear VR and Daydream. Instead, it’s aiming for augmented reality in the manner of Microsoft HoloLens. Unlike Microsoft’s visor, it doesn’t have fancy transparent displays; however, that keeps the price down – $399 for Bridge, though you’ll need to supply the iPhone 6, 6s, or 7 yourself, versus several thousand for HoloLens – and dramatically increases the amount of space for AR effects. That was put to good use in the demo I tried. Bridge first needs to map the room, a quick process involving turning it to look around the walls, floor, and furniture. From that, it builds up a wireframe of the space, so that not only do you see what the iPhone camera sees, but the Bridge Engine understands what’s a horizontal surface, what’s vertical, and all angles in-between. Occipital’s demo app puts a small robot – Bridget – into the room, which you interact with using the Daydream-style controller. You can point and click to navigate it around, with the ‘bot moving around furniture and other objects rather than just running straight through them. Dropping items into the space similarly acknowledges the real topography; at one point, I accidentally backed the robot into a corner by inadvertently positioning a virtual chair in its way. You quickly stop differentiating between what’s real and what’s digitally created, especially when virtual balls start rolling across real tables and bouncing down under and behind things. It’s pushing the capabilities of a smartphone hard. There was a very small amount of lag visible when I moved my head quickly, though not enough to cause any discomfort. The iPhone’s own screen resolution is another limiting factor; Occipital tells me that, even though some Android devices have higher-resolution displays, there are no current plans to support Google’s OS since the design, connectivity, and camera of each phone varies from the next. Google is, probably, Occipital’s biggest competitor. Back at I/O last week, the company showed off its new WorldSense tracking system, built on the indoor visual mapping technology developed as part of Project Tango. WorldSense works by looking for visual anchors in the world, using those as impromptu markers from which it can figure out where the headset-wearer is looking, and how the different objects related in 3D space. Early feedback suggests it works reasonably well, but Google is still apparently recommending that WorldSense systems – which will be standalone, rather than based on slotting in a phone – be used while sitting down or stationary. In contrast, Occipital’s setup allowed me to move around and, far from bumping into things, my biggest klutz was forgetting that you can’t put down real objects like the Bridge controller on a virtual table in that space. Already being on the market is another tick in Occipital’s column, as is existing Bridge Engine integration with popular platforms like SceneKit for VR and AR, and Unity for VR. I’m told developers have been able to get their existing mixed reality experiences up and running on Bridge in as little as ten minutes. For now, Bridge remains a developer-focused device. After all, you can’t really sell a platform to consumers without apps to use on it. Occipital isn’t saying quite how many devices are in the wild, but tells me that the last preorder phase sold out in a matter of days. The demand, clearly, is there. Now we just need the compelling mixed reality experiences to sell it to the mass market.

Google Phone v10 enables post-call messages for failed calls, prepares for enhanced incoming calls on RCS and voicemail backup [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 1:19pm PDTMay 23, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares165 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Post-call messages 2 Teardown 2.1 RCS Calling 2.2 Voicemail Backup 3 Download With the dust settling after the deluge caused by I/O 2017, it's time to take a closer look at some of the many other things that came with out last week. Some interesting changes came with a brand new version of the Google Phone app included with Android O Developer Preview 2. There's a new prompt suggesting users send a message after a call fails to connect. A deep dive into the apk also turned up signs that Google is working on new RCS calling features and preparing some kind of backup option for voicemail. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Post-call messaging Post-call messages Earlier this month, a teardown of of v9 provided a good hint that the Phone app would begin showing suggestions for messages to send after completing a call. With v10, that feature is now live, but not quite as functional as previously expected. Left: snackbar prompt. Right: new message screen. The post-call messaging feature appears as a snackbar prompt asking why you called, to which you can send a message. The prompt only appears after attempting a call that fails without making a connection. To be specific, the prompt won't show up if you hang up, a voicemail service answers, or anything else occurs that would be considered a connection. Basically, if you hear a sound indicating the other end is ringing, any outcome from that point on is probably not going to trigger the prompt. You're most likely to see this prompt in an area where cellular reception isn't good enough to establish a voice call, but you can also force it to show up by trying to make a call while airplane mode is active. Otherwise, it's probably not going to turn up anywhere else. If you opt to send a message, you'll be taken to a screen with a message box and three pre-written messages with different levels of urgency. Tapping a message will put it into the textbox below, but you can continue to make edits before sending. The exact text of the prompt seems to be a mismatch for the current functionality, which left us wondering if this feature is also intended to work in other scenarios like when the call is redirected to voicemail or disconnects within a second of being picked up. Perhaps this is just the first step and other use cases will be handled in the future. In the meantime, this actually might be handy if you're in the middle of nowhere and staring at a single signal bar with no hope of making a call. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. RCS Calling It's no secret that Google is working to add fairly extensive RCS support to both its Phone app and Android Messages. Now it's just a matter of which features are going to be added and when we'll get to use some them. This update to the Phone app gives us a bit more insight into some new rich calling features that we'll soon have at our disposal. A stack of new notification strings reveal that Google's developers are currently working on supporting incoming calls with additional data. At this time, it's clear calls can include a location, photo, message, or any combination of those. One line also mentions "attachments," which may suggest other types of data are supported, but not necessarily known in advance. This would make sense for things like URLs or specially crafted data packets can be handed off between other apps. It's also worth noting that these strings are split up for regular and "important" calls, which lines up with the commonly known feature allowing callers to indicate a degree of urgency. code <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_attachments">Important incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_location">Important incoming call with location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message">Important incoming call with message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Important incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Important incoming call with photo</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Important incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Important incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="important_notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Important incoming call with photo, message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_attachments">Incoming call with attachments</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_location">Incoming call with location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message">Incoming call with message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_message_location">Incoming call with message and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo">Incoming call with photo</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_location">Incoming call with photo and location</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message">Incoming call with photo and message</string> <string name="notification_incoming_call_with_photo_message_location">Incoming call with photo, message and location</string> It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be. After all, knowing there's a photo with the call isn't nearly as compelling as actually seeing it. This was part of the pitch for the Knock Knock feature when Google introduced the Duo app at last year's I/O keynote. The same certainly can be said about locations and messages, as well. So far, there doesn't appear to be an interface for callers to actually attach this type of data, so it's safe to say development is still ongoing. Seeing as most carriers are still stuck on very rudimentary implementations of RCS and intra-network compatibility is moving at a sloth-like pace, I'm sure Google will have this done long before any of us would get to use it. Voicemail Backup Are you the type of person that never deletes voicemails? This one might be for you. It seems that Google will begin asking users if they want to turn on "extra storage" when their voicemail inbox fills its capacity. This allows Google to "manage and backup your voicemail messages" to free up some space. code <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_almost_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is almost full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_title">Turn on extra storage and backup</string> <string name="voicemail_error_inbox_full_turn_archive_on_message">Your mailbox is full. To free up space, turn on extra storage so Google can manage and backup your voicemail messages.</string> <string name="voicemail_action_turn_archive_on">Turn on</string> <string name="voicemail_action_dimiss">No Thanks</string> At this point, I should say that there are a few different things this could be, and I'm at a loss for which one it is. For starters, this could be a new aspect for Project Fi subscribers and the included voicemail service. If so, it might mean Google intends to prompt people with a lot of saved voicemails to push the older ones into their Drive storage. It's a simple explanation, and might be an attempt to squeeze a few bucks out of people that never delete anything, but hardly seems necessary. Another possibility is that this only relates to the voicemails downloaded and stored on your phone, which means it's just a basic housekeeping feature to keep unnecessary audio files out of your local storage or expand the quota to allow for more. I tend to doubt this is the explanation because the text doesn't really line up with that purpose and it seems like the type of thing that should happen automatically, users shouldn't even need to be prompted. Finally, I'm going to take the opportunity to speculate about something a little crazy. Perhaps this is intended for the voicemail service provided by other carriers. If this is the case, I imagine the phone app might detect your voicemail is nearing capacity and offers to manage backups of it. If the user agrees, Google will connect to that provider's voicemail and proceed to back up all of the messages to Drive for the user, then delete them to free up space. Again, this is massively speculative and feels like a long shot... But it's also the type of weirdly cool feature Google occasionally comes up with. There's not much else to go on with this, but it's entirely possible this feature / warning / error message is already live. It may only show up for users connecting to a specific carrier or with special circumstances that aren't very predictable. I'm not really the right person to test it since I only have three voicemails saved, but perhaps readers with a larger backlog will have something to add to this.

I'll try to test that the next time I reset the phone while on O. James Well according to Google's implementation of the omtp visual voicemail standard (https://source.android.com/devices/tech/config/voicemail) it's vvm client "Fetches details of voicemail quota (total mailbox size and occupied size)" from the carrier so it's probably for carriers that have implemented the stock omtp vvm standard like t-mobile. James Briano Tangentially related: Anyone else getting errors with the phone app on Dev Preview 2? App keeps crashing when I have an incoming call. Nexus 6P. Cody Toombs I haven't put the SIM card into my 6P for more than a couple of minutes since the developer previews started going on there, so I can't comment to that exact scenario, but it has been working perfectly on my Pixel running 7.1.2. I've had pretty regular issues with Google apps crashing on DP1 and DP2. It may be a coincidence, but it seems especially bad for any app that uses hardware components like GPS and cellular radio. I'm not complaining since we all should know the deal with bleeding edge releases, but I think the O developer previews have been the buggiest I've used since Google started with KitKat. Andy J "It's not yet clear if attachments will be shown on the screen with incoming calls, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be." Yes - yes it is. All the stuff people are left wondering about is covered in a LOT of depth in the Universal Profile spec - in this particular case, selecting a photo to be shown on the receivers screen when the phone call comes in - is specifically detailed in the spec. It's worth also being aware that as it's also specifically in the spec that the phone book must expose which contacts support Universal Profile - that I'd expect both the contacts app and the dialer app to be opened up to all devices on the Play Store before too much longer - otherwise only Messages supports RCS and people will have phones where they can't actually tell if they can make a video call or send someone a file (or their location) - all they can do is send them a message. mike shwilly Can i just have Swipe to Delete sms feature?

Google is adding an option to disable all network media notifications on Chromecast and Google Home devices Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 9:51am PDTMay 23, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares213 Chromecast Google Google Home News The addition of Chromecast network notifications probably seemed like a good idea at the time. They allow you to control media even if you aren't the one who started playback. However, you see those notifications on your device even if you're not watching or listening to the content, and you can end up with multiple cast notifications on a busy network. Google is finally making these notifications optional with a toggle that turns off all the network notifications for your Chromecast or Google Home. Previously, you could only disable the notifications on a per device basis. So, each person on your network had to go into their Google settings and turn off the notifications. According to Google's Chromecast support page, there's a toggle in the Google Home app that can disable the notifications for all content at the network level. Casting to the device will no longer produce a media notification for anyone on your network. Here's now you do it... or how you will eventually. Open the Google Home app. In the top right corner of the Home screen, tap Devices to see available Chromecast devices. Scroll to find the device card for the Chromecast you'd like prevent sending cast notifications. In the top right corner of the device card, tap the device card menu. Under Device info, turn "Let others control your casted media" off. Google seems to have jumped the gun a little adding this to the support page. No one on the AP team has this option in settings yet, even those of us in the preview program. Give it a few days and the toggle will probably appear.

It's OK, hopefully Google will fix it... someday. LOL Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I strangely have the exact opposite problem. If I start playing some music on my Google Home and stop it later (or it stops itself), I'll still have a streaming notification sitting on my phone hours later. Sadly because there is no other interface I'll have to leave that device enabled, but I can finally switch off my SHIELD and Chromecasts! Bartek Juszczak I've been on both sides of that. Sometimes the notification is there for hours when it shouldn't be an you can't swipe it away. Other times the notification of the app that's casting disappears for no reason and this one half saves me though not too much cause all you can do is pause. It's all just quite broken Bartek Juszczak Yeah the casting system is still a bit of a broken mess. With a Chromecast Audio I still can't say "Ok Google, play music on my chromecast", it just doesn't work with audio. With Google Play Music I still can't start playback on my computer. Apps disconnect and casting breaks all the time. Notifications get stuck. Different track name is displayed to what's playing etc. Unable to do anything but pause and play via the notification, should be able to skip tracks, change volume etc etc. Sometimes it all *barely* works.

YaKillaCJ The real issue is Google needs to fix the connection issues. Even on stable and great networks, Casting disconnect. Networks where UPnP devices wouldn't skip a beat. We really should have advanced options to refresh rates and option to disable sleep while casting for example. Also part of the issue is the lack of ability to use Casting while offline. I shouldn't have to be online for casting local content. All I'm saying is to fix the real issues and they wouldn't have to try and force annoying notifications to everyone. 4Ui812 I turned this shit off on my phone as soon as they added it. I kept shutting off other people's cast by accident thinking I was the one who started it. boop Seem like it's broken on O anyway Ryan It should have been an "opt in" feature. I cant say how many times my girlfriend would break casting before we figured this out. Bartek Juszczak It shouldn't have been. This means that if my grandparents get chromecasts/cast devices, it will be super easy for them, either of them can pause or control any chromecast at any time, it's super convenient and if it's not on by default they'll never know it exists. What it should be is a pre-selected option during the initial cast device setup "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing." Ryan "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing.", So opt in then? And odds are your grandparents were more likely to constantly just be shutting eachothers casts off like everyone else. Bartek Juszczak Opt-in as in not on by default but can be turned on? This would be preselected as on, if you just quickly skip through the setup it would be on. If you pay more attention you can untick it. Opt in would mean most people wouldn't have it, either because they skipped through setup quickly or because it's unticked by default, so if they're not familiar with it it feels safer to leave it off. And no, a lot of people do use it as intended and not to switch each other's stuff off. Though if the notification said who's casting, had next, previous and volume control buttons, it would be far more useful. YaKillaCJ I disagree. I see it as a nuisance, invasion of privacy, and lacks useful functionality. The very idea is that the device that started the casting is the remote. Not every connected device becomes a remote. I can see and understand its use case but it should definitely have been opt in. Cory S I live alone, so the most annoying thing about these notifications for me is they aren't consistent. I never know if I pull my phone out of my pocket if the damn thing will be there or not. nxtiak I wish we can ADJUST the volume. I have Google Home playing to my Chrome Audio in my kitchen, sucks that I can't adjust the volume of it using this notification. neoKushan It's not just the volume, all you can really do with the notification is pause and stop. I find this incredibly frustrating, if I've got the app installed I should be able to have full control, or at the very least next/previous - you know, basic media controls for your media notification. Cliff Robertson Oh boy. The notifications I blocked months ago will have a setting to turn it off... Shane Hull Blocked it how? trwnh Thank God. Finally.

I'd prefer to keep it on. But what DOES annoy me is when I get two cast notifications for something I'VE cast. Has this been addressed yet?

A new Google feature can tell when someone who clicked on an ad in search results made a credit or debit card purchase at a corresponding physical store. The tool will give advertisers a better idea of how successful their online ad campaigns are. How does Google know if you bought something at Subway or Aldo? It works with the credit and debit card companies to match up in-store purchases with your online identity. The company has partnerships with companies that account for 70% of credit and debit card purchases in the U.S. The credit card companies provide Google with encrypted information about purchases, which Google software then compares to Google profiles of people who viewed relevant ads. Google cannot actually see any of the encrypted data, so it does not have access to identifiable payment information, like the person’s name or what they bought. The matches are tallied up in aggregate to protect privacy. That means Google can tell a restaurant their ads resulted in 1,000 people going there to eat and how much they spent, but not share any personal information about individual diners. In an early test, fast food chain Wendy’s was able to see that just under a million people ended up buying food at their restaurants after viewing Wendy’s ads in a Google search. For all its futuristic investments like self-driving cars, internet-beaming balloons and thermostats, Google is still an advertising company. It relies on ad sales for the majority of its revenue. Last quarter, ads made up $21.4 billion of Alphabet’s $24.8 billion in sales. Making the connection between online ads and in-person purchases could be huge for the company, which is competing against companies like Facebook for the same ad buyers. Google is also adding another real-world tool to get more customers into physical stores. It will show information for local stores on YouTube ads, such as hours and driving directions to the nearest store or chain location. In order to know what stores you’re close to, YouTube will rely on information from your location history. The company has been using this feature on Search and Maps since 2014. Google announced the tools on Tuesday at its annual advertising and marketing conference in San Francisco. The YouTube feature is well timed. Earlier this year, some advertisers pulled out of YouTube ads after they were shown alongside extremist videos. If the idea of Google tracking real world purchases, even in aggregate, unsettles you, there are ways to opt out. You can log out of your Google Account before using search, or turn off your search history so that it’s not saved. You can also use cash to buy your frosty and fries. For the local ad information tool, you can turn off your location history.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares477 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well.

See also: The complete list of services with Google Home support (Updated) 2 days ago IKEA is definitely my go-to place for inexpensive furniture, as I’m sure is the case for many of you; after all, no one wants to pay more than they have to. Now, IKEA’s furniture and home appliances may be affordable, but the Swedish retailer certainly isn’t behind the times. It already offers various smart lightbulbs as well as motion sensor kits and dimming kits, which work with a separate app on Android, but according to IKEA’s Swedish press release, they’re about to get even smarter. Starting this summer into autumn, IKEA’s TRÅDFRI smart lights will get voice control support through popular smart home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo. Starting this summer into autumn, IKEA’s TRÅDFRI smart lights will get voice control support through popular smart home devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo. It will also work with Apple HomeKit. The company explains that it sees “huge potential in the market for smart home,” and there is no doubt that its low-priced products are likely to have a disruptive impact on the market. IKEA’s TRÅDFRI smart lightbulbs range from $17.99 to $26.99, offering similar specs to popular products like Philips Hue at a fraction of the cost. Smart speakers with virtual assistants living in them are expected to grow almost 130 percent this year compared to last year, so the chances are, there will be even more people looking for a way to turn their homes into smart ones without spending a fortune. IKEA’s upcoming Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit support may prove to be the perfect solution. This isn’t the first time that IKEA has incorporated technology into its products: the Swedish furniture company previously partnered with the Wireless Power Consortium to bring Qi wireless charging completely built into items like desk lamps and bedside tables. buy lightbulbs from ikea Will you be buying IKEA’s smart bulbs for your home?

A group of Google employees have begun a message board for employees to submit worker complaints that's then emailed weekly as a digest, according to a report on Bloomberg. The email list -- called "Yes, at Google" -- has been around since October and allows employees to talk openly about work situations in which they felt uncomfortable; most submissions are anonymized. From the article: Google management is aware of the list. "We work really hard to promote and preserve a culture of respect and inclusion," a Google spokesperson said in a statement. "Our employees have numerous ways to raise issues -- both negative and positive -- with us, including through grassroots transparency efforts like this one. We take concerns seriously and take appropriate measures to address them." The list is run by a group of workers across different product areas, according to a person familiar with the list, though it's not clear who runs the list and how or whether the submissions are vetted before being distributed. Usually, the people in the complaints are not named, though one submission described an instance when, during a large company meeting in late April, Alphabet Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt allegedly interrupted Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat when she had a question addressed to her, which the post categorized as a "gender-related" complaint. A person who attended the meeting said Schmidt answered the question to make a joke. Messages sometimes include job titles and other details. google culture life ← You may like to read: → Comcast Proves Need For Net Neutrality By Trying To Censor Advocacy Website Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Twitters Says It Will Ban Trump If He Breaks Hate-Speech Rules Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

I first heard of the interruption difference years ago when I read this book [amazon.com]. Once I was attuned to it, I noticed it happening in meetings, and I noticed that I did it myself. So I try to interrupt less, and if someone else interrupts a woman during a meeting, I often later ask her to finish her point. So at least in my case, it made a difference.

Gimme the rope. Be careful what you wish for. Harsh punishments for rape are correlated with very high acquittal rates and a cultural of impunity. Society's "ideal" of rape is a pure innocent blonde virgin minding her own business when some total stranger grabs her and drags her into the bushes. Very few real rapes are anything like that, but the more the actual situation diverges from the "ideal", the less likely the women is to be believed or even take seriously. Very few juries are likely to put a seemingly nice guy in prison for 20 years because of a "he-said-she-said" accusation of date rape.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea..

So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures. Anthrox give it some time today is the first lunch of software outside of play and play music. software is complex you have many different teams with different goals the family support might be coming after other feature they need to do first makapav Humbug excuses.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares477 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future.

Apple Brand value: $170 bil 1-year change: 10% Company ad spending: $1.8 bil 21/21 SLIDESClick through the gallery above to see the world's 20 most valuable brands. Brand value is the ultimate currency craved by companies. A valuable brand spurs demand and creates pricing power. Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 153.80 -0.19 -0.12% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,800.00 -50.00 -2.70% Starbucks Corp SBUX ▼ 61.15 -0.08 -0.13% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▲ 68.68 +0.23 +0.34% Exhibit A: Apple and the iPhone, which sold 78 million units in the fourth quarter of 2016. The average selling price was $695. Pricing for chief competitor Samsung was more than $500 less, according to research from Canaccord Genuity. The result: Apple earned 92% of the profits in the smartphone category and has racked up a cash hoard of $257 billion on its balance sheet. Apple tops Forbes’ annual study of the most valuable brands in the world for the seventh straight year, worth $170 billion. Its brand value is up 10% over last year and represents 21% of the company’s recent market value of $806 billion. The Apple train is not slowing down anytime soon. The iPhone 8 is expected to be out in the fall. The company is celebrating the 10th anniversary of the transformational product, and the latest version is expected to include an OLED screen, wireless charging and a host of other changes. The new features could push the price to north of $1,000 for the 256GB version and propel Apple to be the first company with a market capitalization of $1 trillion.  Google ranks second among the most valuable brands at $101.8 billion. It’s the second straight year Google has placed second to Apple, and it is closing the gap with a 23% gain this year after a 26% jump in 2016. Google has integrated itself into multiple aspects of our daily routines with seven products with over one billion users each, according to the company. They include Android, Chrome, Gmail, Google Play Store, Maps, Search and YouTube (Forbes values YouTube separately from Google as a brand, but the video-sharing website did not crack the top 100 brands). To “google” is synonymous for search, but the Alphabet subsidiary is still fighting to protect its brand. A federal appeals court affirmed the Google trademark this month, ruling the brand name was worth protecting in a case from 2012 involving cybersquatting of 763 domain names with the word “google” in them. The value of Google is surging, and it will not go the way of aspirin, elevator, thermos and other brands that faced “genericide.” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote: “The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic.” Rounding out the top five brands are Microsoft ($87 billion, up 16%), Facebook ($73.5 billion, up 40%) and Coca-Cola ($56.4 billion, down 4%). Load Error The 100 most valuable brands are worth a cumulative $1.95 trillion, up 6% over last year. They range from Apple on top at $170 billion to German financial services firm Allianz with a brand worth $6.8 billion by Forbes’ count. We evaluated more than 200 global brands to determine the final list of 100. Brands were required to have a presence in the U.S., which knocked out some big brands like multinational telecom firm Vodafone. The top 100 includes product brands like Anheuser-Busch InBev’s Budweiser, as well as brands marketed under their corporate name like Starbucks. Forbes valued the brands on three years of earnings and allocated a percentage of those earnings based on the role brands play in each industry (e.g., high for luxury goods and beverages, low for airlines and oil companies). We applied the average price-to-earnings multiple over the past three years to these earnings to arrive at the final brand valuable (click here for the complete methodology). Tech brands dominate the top 100 with 18 making the cut, including nine of the top 15. Thirteen financial service brands qualified, led by American Express at No. 22 worth $24.5 billion. The 12 consumer packaged goods brands were headed by Gillette at No. 28 ($19.2 billion). The U.S. is home to just over half the list with 56 brands, followed by Germany (11), France (7) and Japan (6). Companies based in 15 countries landed at least one brand among the top 100. Most of the major risers this year came from the world of tech with Amazon leading the way, up 54% to $54.1 billion and sixth overall. The e-commerce giant’s number of Prime members in the U.S. has doubled over the past two years to 80 million, or two-thirds of American households, according to data from research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Firm. Other big gainers were Facebook (+40%), Starbucks (24%) and Google (23%). IBM had the biggest drop for the second straight year. Big Blue’s brand declined 20% to $33.3 billion and No. 13 overall after ranking fifth as recently as 2015. The company has moved away from hardware and software to focus on its cloud computing division and the result is 20 straight quarters of sales declines. Other brands that took big hits were HSBC (down 18%), Caterpillar (-11%) and H&M (-11%). Adobe was the highest-ranking of seven new entries in the top 100. The software brand ranked No. 84 with a value of $7.4 billion. Volkswagen ranked No. 77 last year, but its brand value fell 10% to $6.7 billion to knock it out of the top 100. It was the third straight decline for the reeling German carmaker, which has been embroiled in a scandal involving cheating exhaust emissions tests. VW was ordered to pay a $2.8 billion criminal penalty last month by a U.S. federal judge, on top of a $1.5 billion civil penalty.

Promote your Business on Economictimes.com for free and reach out to millions of potential Customers List Your Business Find Service Near You MUMBAI: Google is putting machine learning front and centre of its advertising model. Jerry Dischler, vice president of product management for AdWords at Google, said, “Every day Google Analytics processes half a trillion digital moments across devices. As an AI first company, we are helping advertisers make sense of this to create ad platforms that are more useful and connected.” Included in its new suite of services is what Dischler calls “An industry first solution that measures from a digital ad click to a store purchase, without the complex integration of existing solutions in the market. It’s the holy grail for marketers: closing the loop between a click and a store purchase.” Also being introduced is Google Attribution which will measure the value of every online marketing channel, to gain a better understanding of a marketer’s investment. And finally, Google is expanding its local ad efforts and its store visits technology to video, allowing consumers to discover nearby retail outlets, leading to a direct path from a video ad to shopping offline. It will also help advertisers track the offline effectiveness of their video spends. The solutions are aimed at ‘always on’ consumers who make a purchase only after multiple rounds of research, across devices. As Babak Pahlavan, senior director of product management, Google explains, “We don’t just click and buy. Attribution is about assigning values to each step that leads to our decision. It’s hard to do, and so most marketers credit only the last thing the consumer did.” Google has built its attribution solution on Adometry, a company it acquired three years ago. It promises a simple workflow, which allows advertisers to import their data, choose the right attribution model, export it to Google AdWords and optimise their campaigns. Says Pahlavan, “We’ve reduced something that could take months to a few minutes.” According to Dischler, “Online advertising is driving consumers into stores. We’ve measured over 5 billion store visits in 17 countries that were the result of ad clicks.” He was also quick to clarify that Google only uses data from users who share location history and anonymises their data. In the US, Google will introduce TV attribution this quarter, looking at minute by minute airing of TV advertisements to see if they correlate to a rise in search traffic or website visits.

Ginny Marvin on May 23, 2017 at 1:58 pm More At Tuesday’s Google Marketing Next event, Google announced more integrations for AMP for Display and Search advertisers. For search advertisers, Google is launching a beta to serve AMP-enabled landing pages on mobile from Search ads. After users click a search ad from mobile, the ad will direct to the AMP landing page that can serve up much faster than standard landing pages. When creating ads in AdWords, advertisers will be able to designate an AMP-enabled landing page at the ad level. Google says early testing has shown improved user behavior and conversion outcomes.

The big SMX Advanced preview Join us for dedicated SEO and SEM tracks, exhibitor demos and solutions and powerful networking. 76% of tickets are sold! Chris Sherman on May 23, 2017 at 3:53 pm More Search Engine Land’s always sold-out SMX Advanced, the only search marketing conference designed exclusively for experienced search marketers, returns to Seattle June 12-14. Keep reading to find out what’s in store this year. Then register; fewer than 200 spots are left! New trends, new opportunities and new challenges Change is constant in search marketing. Opportunities emerge faster than they can be absorbed: new targeting capabilities, new mobile-first indexes, the explosion of voice search. Even veteran marketers are perpetually catching up with what is possible. SMX Advanced delivers expert-level tactics you’ll put to work immediately to harness the opportunities and cope with the challenges. It’s your survival guide to the dynamic and tumultuous world of search marketing. Advanced SEO for fun & profit We’ll kick off the SEO track by unveiling of The Periodic Table Of SEO Ranking Factors: 2017 Edition, our comprehensive examination of search ranking factors that are influencing results. Our panel of organic search experts will weigh in on what’s on the rise, what’s on the decline, what still works and what doesn’t. They will parse the data for you and focus on the key elements that deliver maximum SEO success. After digesting the big picture, AMP For Advanced SEOs takes you deep inside accelerated mobile pages: implementation techniques, display issues, measurement capabilities and more. The buzz this year is that Google is now using a mobile-first index based on how mobile devices crawl the web. If you’ve optimized your site, this shouldn’t impact your traffic, but there are steps you can take to capitalize fully on the opportunity presented by this radical new approach to indexing content. In Mobile-First For The Advanced SEO, our panelists will discuss techniques for performing an audit in a mobile-first world to ensure that content, links, metadata and structured data are compliant, regardless of how your site is accessed by users. We’ll also discuss tactics and techniques to improve the mobile user experience and potentially boost your rankings. These days, Google rarely confirms algorithm updates. In fact, the Panda algorithm runs continuously and evolves. Likewise, the Penguin algorithm runs in real time, and it’s common to see ranking and traffic changes on a daily or weekly basis. Without guidance or transparency from Google, how should SEOs react to ranking changes or possible penalties? How can you manage your bosses’ or clients’ expectations? Dealing With Algorithm Updates: What Advanced SEOs Need To Know explores essential tactics to help you survive and thrive. Want more advanced SEO content? Feast on these sessions during SMX Advanced: Local Search Braintrust: Open Q&A on Local SEO How Progressive Web Apps May Kill App Indexing Ask The SEOs SEM for pros Google and Bing continue to launch new paid search capabilities with new extensions, retargeting options and more. The lines are blurring between “simple” text-based paid search and other forms of online advertising such as display, video, social and emerging formats. Because the world of SEM is always changing, we’re always adjusting the agenda and working with our speakers to including breaking news and insights. For example, you’ll hear about recent changes in AdWords that may be impacting your performance, including a shift in Ad Rank thresholds and the introduction of historical Quality Score data. The SEM track kicks off with the now-infamous Mad Scientists Of Paid Search. While most of us spend our days toiling away in the deepest details of paid search campaigns, the Mad Scientists are running experiments, testing regression models and analyzing larger trends to unlock the fundamental secrets of paid search auctions, attribution, economics and search behaviors. Grab your safety goggles and bunsen burners and hear what’s happening in the lab. With all of the new options available to advertisers, you need new approaches to gain maximum return from your campaigns. Forget about better than average click and conversion rates. The only things standing between you and breakthrough campaign success are your ads. Our experts in Conversion Optimization: Turning Quick Wins Into Winning Streaks will show you how they write great ads, how they test quickly and effectively, and will give you insights into the proven processes they use to maintain high performance day-after-day and month-after-month. Audience targeting allows you to be precise in choosing who sees your ads and the bids for each group. Enhance your toolbox with targeting options such as demographics, similar lists, in-market audiences and CRM data. Create custom combinations and fine-tune the displays for your audiences, or even exclude audience groups. In Taking Audience Targeting To The Next Level, you’ll learn to use advanced audience targeting to identify prospects and customers and ultimately maximize the ROI of your campaigns.

Quality programming I’ve covered most of the show, which has over 35 editorial sessions in all. All the SMX sessions I’ve described above are what we call editorial sessions. People are speaking on them because we feel they have great information to offer. No one bought their way onto a panel. Each session is developed by a “session coordinator” who reviews speaking pitches and reaches out to knowledgeable people to assemble a panel. The session coordinator works with the speakers to create a session where presentations support each other, rather than overlap. In most cases, the session coordinator is also the session moderator. Formats also vary. Sometimes we have panels with multiple people. Sometimes we have only one or two speakers. Some panels are all Q&A. Some feature presentations. We don’t lock ourselves into one particular format, because different topics require different approaches. Instead, we focus on creating a great overall experience. The entire editorial portion of the show is overseen by myself and my co-chair Danny Sullivan. We’ve been organizing search conferences longer than anyone in the industry – more than 18 years and counting! Expo hall & solutions track Our many SMX Advanced sponsors & exhibitors also have great information to share. That’s why we provide several ways for attendees to hear from them. As part of the SMX agenda, you’ll also have access to our Solutions Track. Unlike our editorial sessions, these are created and produced by sponsoring companies. These sessions offer you an opportunity to learn even more from the vendors you already work with or who you are considering. We work closely with each solution provider to make sure that plenty of great information is offered. Outside the Solutions Track, you’ll have opportunities to meet these vendors and others at the Expo Hall. For two days, you’ll get industry-leading demos and solutions from exhibitors and sponsors to make you a better search marketer. Special thanks to our Premier Sponsors Bing and Google, our Gold Sponsors Bruce Clay, Inc. and Stone Temple Consulting. Expand your professional network SMX Advanced brings together the most accomplished search marketers in the world, and we provide plenty of organized and social networking activities for you to connect with your peers. Even before you arrive, you’ll have access to our official event app and a private Facebook group that will let you connect, network and plan your show. We kick off with the SMX Meet & Greet reception, sponsored by Bruce Clay, Inc., Brightedge and Majestic. This informal reception takes place outside, on the top of the Bell Harbor building and offers incredible views and plenty of engaging conversations with your fellow attendees and speakers. The Meet & Greet reception is followed by the popular Janes Of Digital evening panel and group discussion event, covering topics in equity, diversity and inclusion. Join us for small bites, drinks, connecting and engaging discussion between industry leaders and the audience. Sponsored by Bing and SMX, Janes of Digital takes place just blocks away from the Bell Harbor at the Olympic Sculpture Park on the Seattle waterfront. Next up is the SMX Expo Hall Reception, which is on Tuesday, June 13 from 6:00pm to 7:00pm.

Chris Sherman on May 23, 2017 at 3:58 pm More Search Engine Land’s always sold-out SMX Advanced, the only search marketing conference designed exclusively for experienced search marketers, returns to Seattle June 12-14. Keep reading to find out what’s in store this year. Then register; fewer than 200 spots are left! New trends, new opportunities and new challenges Change is constant in search marketing. Opportunities emerge faster than they can be absorbed: new targeting capabilities, new mobile-first indexes, the explosion of voice search. Even veteran marketers are perpetually catching up with what is possible. SMX Advanced delivers expert-level tactics you’ll put to work immediately to harness the opportunities and cope with the challenges. It’s your survival guide to the dynamic and tumultuous world of search marketing. Advanced SEO for fun & profit We’ll kick off the SEO track by unveiling of The Periodic Table Of SEO Ranking Factors: 2017 Edition, our comprehensive examination of search ranking factors that are influencing results. Our panel of organic search experts will weigh in on what’s on the rise, what’s on the decline, what still works and what doesn’t. They will parse the data for you and focus on the key elements that deliver maximum SEO success. After digesting the big picture, AMP For Advanced SEOs takes you deep inside accelerated mobile pages: implementation techniques, display issues, measurement capabilities and more. The buzz this year is that Google is now using a mobile-first index based on how mobile devices crawl the web. If you’ve optimized your site, this shouldn’t impact your traffic, but there are steps you can take to capitalize fully on the opportunity presented by this radical new approach to indexing content. In Mobile-First For The Advanced SEO, our panelists will discuss techniques for performing an audit in a mobile-first world to ensure that content, links, metadata and structured data are compliant, regardless of how your site is accessed by users. We’ll also discuss tactics and techniques to improve the mobile user experience and potentially boost your rankings. These days, Google rarely confirms algorithm updates. In fact, the Panda algorithm runs continuously and evolves. Likewise, the Penguin algorithm runs in real time, and it’s common to see ranking and traffic changes on a daily or weekly basis. Without guidance or transparency from Google, how should SEOs react to ranking changes or possible penalties? How can you manage your bosses’ or clients’ expectations? Dealing With Algorithm Updates: What Advanced SEOs Need To Know explores essential tactics to help you survive and thrive. Want more advanced SEO content? Feast on these sessions during SMX Advanced: Local Search Braintrust: Open Q&A on Local SEO How Progressive Web Apps May Kill App Indexing Ask The SEOs SEM for pros Google and Bing continue to launch new paid search capabilities with new extensions, retargeting options and more. The lines are blurring between “simple” text-based paid search and other forms of online advertising such as display, video, social and emerging formats. Because the world of SEM is always changing, we’re always adjusting the agenda and working with our speakers to including breaking news and insights. For example, you’ll hear about recent changes in AdWords that may be impacting your performance, including a shift in Ad Rank thresholds and the introduction of historical Quality Score data. The SEM track kicks off with the now-infamous Mad Scientists Of Paid Search. While most of us spend our days toiling away in the deepest details of paid search campaigns, the Mad Scientists are running experiments, testing regression models and analyzing larger trends to unlock the fundamental secrets of paid search auctions, attribution, economics and search behaviors. Grab your safety goggles and bunsen burners and hear what’s happening in the lab. With all of the new options available to advertisers, you need new approaches to gain maximum return from your campaigns. Forget about better than average click and conversion rates. The only things standing between you and breakthrough campaign success are your ads. Our experts in Conversion Optimization: Turning Quick Wins Into Winning Streaks will show you how they write great ads, how they test quickly and effectively, and will give you insights into the proven processes they use to maintain high performance day-after-day and month-after-month. Audience targeting allows you to be precise in choosing who sees your ads and the bids for each group. Enhance your toolbox with targeting options such as demographics, similar lists, in-market audiences and CRM data. Create custom combinations and fine-tune the displays for your audiences, or even exclude audience groups. In Taking Audience Targeting To The Next Level, you’ll learn to use advanced audience targeting to identify prospects and customers and ultimately maximize the ROI of your campaigns. Additional paid search sessions include: Paid Search & Social: Twin Children Of Different Mothers Protecting Your Brand In The Era Of Fake News The Neverending Quest For Better Paid Search Campaigns A Year of Change In The Online Ad Universe SEM Analytics: Giving Your Educated Guesses An Advanced Degree Ask The SEMs Unique keynotes for SEOs and SEMs For SEOs, Advanced kicks off with our keynote conversation AMA With Google Search. Search Engine Land founding editor Danny Sullivan will talk with Google’s Gary Illyes in an open, freewheeling and entertaining discussion about the most burning topics in SEO today. Your participation is essential to this PowerPoint-free discussion. At the same time, SEMs can join Search Engine Land’s paid search maven Ginny Marvin, who will be hosting keynote conversations with Jerry Dischler, Vice President, Product Management, AdWords, Google, and Steve Sirich General Manager, Global Search Ads Business, Microsoft. Here’s who speaking Advanced offers keynote-level, solo presentations focusing on forward-looking themes and trends wrapped in actionable takeaways you can use immediately. Speakers are selected for their thought-leadership, unique perspective and insights into digital marketing.

Come a day early, and choose from one of our six all day in-depth workshops and training workshops: Bruce Clay Advanced SEO Training Certified Knowledge Advanced AdWords Training Content Marketing Mastery Mastering Google Analytics Mastering Social Media Advertising Search-Engine Friendly Mobile Design & Development You’ll save $400 off on-site rates by registering for an All Access + Workshop combo pass. Quality programming I’ve covered most of the show, which has over 35 editorial sessions in all. All the SMX sessions I’ve described above are what we call editorial sessions. People are speaking on them because we feel they have great information to offer. No one bought their way onto a panel. Each session is developed by a “session coordinator” who reviews speaking pitches and reaches out to knowledgeable people to assemble a panel. The session coordinator works with the speakers to create a session where presentations support each other, rather than overlap. In most cases, the session coordinator is also the session moderator. Formats also vary. Sometimes we have panels with multiple people. Sometimes we have only one or two speakers. Some panels are all Q&A. Some feature presentations. We don’t lock ourselves into one particular format, because different topics require different approaches. Instead, we focus on creating a great overall experience. The entire editorial portion of the show is overseen by myself and my co-chair Danny Sullivan. We’ve been organizing search conferences longer than anyone in the industry – more than 18 years and counting! Expo hall & solutions track Our many SMX Advanced sponsors & exhibitors also have great information to share. That’s why we provide several ways for attendees to hear from them. As part of the SMX agenda, you’ll also have access to our Solutions Track. Unlike our editorial sessions, these are created and produced by sponsoring companies. These sessions offer you an opportunity to learn even more from the vendors you already work with or who you are considering. We work closely with each solution provider to make sure that plenty of great information is offered. Outside the Solutions Track, you’ll have opportunities to meet these vendors and others at the Expo Hall. For two days, you’ll get industry-leading demos and solutions from exhibitors and sponsors to make you a better search marketer. Special thanks to our Premier Sponsors Bing and Google, our Gold Sponsors Bruce Clay, Inc. and Stone Temple Consulting. Expand your professional network SMX Advanced brings together the most accomplished search marketers in the world, and we provide plenty of organized and social networking activities for you to connect with your peers. Even before you arrive, you’ll have access to our official event app and a private Facebook group that will let you connect, network and plan your show. We kick off with the SMX Meet & Greet reception, sponsored by Bruce Clay, Inc., Brightedge and Majestic. This informal reception takes place outside, on the top of the Bell Harbor building and offers incredible views and plenty of engaging conversations with your fellow attendees and speakers. The Meet & Greet reception is followed by the popular Janes Of Digital evening panel and group discussion event, covering topics in equity, diversity and inclusion. Join us for small bites, drinks, connecting and engaging discussion between industry leaders and the audience. Sponsored by Bing and SMX, Janes of Digital takes place just blocks away from the Bell Harbor at the Olympic Sculpture Park on the Seattle waterfront. Next up is the SMX Expo Hall Reception, which is on Tuesday, June 13 from 6:00pm to 7:00pm. The reception offers another chance to mingle and check out best-of-breed marketing solutions from our exhibitors and sponsors.

Listen | Print By Jack Derricourt     11 hours ago in Business Google showed at this year’s I/O conference that it has a radical vision of the future. Smartphones and search engines were the last thing on CEO Sundar Pichai’s mind as he gave his keynote speech. The kinds of innovations that Google showed off at this year’s I/O are the stuff that dreams are made of — except that these are initiatives being undertaken right now, realities just coming to fruition. Businesses seeking to push ahead with the move to digital, or enterprises wanting to know which direction the wind is blowing in, would be smart to keep an eye on these new shifts in technology. A number of Google’s I/O announcements show business owners and innovators where technology is going — useful information when thinking about not just where digital transformation is right now, but where it’s headed within ten years. While some have criticized this year’s I/O for its lack of moonshots there were a number of important steps forward announced by Google. Not every conference can be skydivers jumping out of planes with Google Glass strapped to their heads. And while not as sexy to show off, big changes are happening — especially in AI assistants, virtual reality and augmented reality. So what changes were discussed at I/O and how do they apply to small and medium sized businesses? Google Lens One of the biggest innovations announced at I/O was Google Lens. A part of Google Assistant, Lens adopts the company’s Vision API in order to identify the contents of an image. Sundar Pichai broke it down into pretty simple terms at I/O: “Google Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you’re looking at and help you take actions based on that information.” Apart from the most sensational application of this new tech — providing customers with a picture of your WiFi login info so they can snap a photo of it to log in automatically — businesses could see great benefits from adapting to a new world of information-rich images and machine learning-based marketing. The amount of data businesses are allowed to provide to customers through Lens will determine just how useful the technology will be, but there’s a lot of potential here. Machine Learning Almost every big announcement Google made was in large part due to advancements in machine learning. The biggest gains for businesses approaching AI and machine learning has to be understanding and streamlining the customer’s journey during their entire experience with the product, website, etc. But Google also presented another interesting angle to machine learning at I/O. Google for Jobs intends to better match job applicants with appropriate positions. This could take some of the headache out of searching for a new employee. The job filling process is daunting and filled with hiccups. Adding some machine learning efficiency to the process could speed things up substantially. Augmented Reality The most impressive demo at this year’s I/O was definitely Tango, the mobile AR app that Google has spent years developing. With the app, Google demonstrated how AR objects can be anchored in real space. A globe was presented in the middle of a classroom, observable to anyone. While education is obviously going to benefit from AR tech like Tango, there are other forms of business that are likely to benefit from the use of AR apps. Retail is already making a big show of AR, allowing consumers to test out their products without being in the physical store space. FAQ information or operation manuals could soon be provided to consumers or potential clients in an entirely interactive, attractive format. It’s not a big jump from those examples to customers accessing food menus with representative AR images for each menu item, or looking at examples of previous work by different service providers through the medium of AR. An augmented reality resume could do a lot to grab the attention of digitally savvy customers. Now, Tango remains a ways off for the world beyond developers and their gleeful dreams, but it looks like we’re moving quickly towards a watershed moment for AR technology. The potential for businesses once the technology becomes scalable is immense. While many businesses know the time is now to make the shift to digital, it’s important to be familiar with the changing trends in technology. Google I/O 2017 provided a solid indication of where things are headed.

Now there’s a second way: you can watch everything the service has to offer on an Apple TV via the AirPlay functionality. YouTube TV Just Added 7 New Networks—Here's How It Stacks Up YouTube is new to the television streaming game but the company is already adding seven new…Read more In the service’s recent iOS app update, AirPlay support was added, reports The Verge. This feature lets anyone with an Apple TV view YouTube TV on their television set. Prior to this update, those who function primarily on Apple devices could access the service through the YouTube TV iOS app on the iPad and the iPhone. Advertisement It should be noted that YouTube TV isn’t introducing a native Apple TV app—or any other streaming box app, for that matter—just yet. This is a limitation for YouTube TV; other streaming TV services like Sling, DirecTV and Hulu have apps. But it’s a step in the right direction for the new streaming service, which is diversifying what hardware can stream its content.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures.

Continuing their long record of support for equality, major employers Citibanamex, Accenture, Google, Kellogg and Mastercard have already committed to participate in the Mexico-focused survey and report. The survey was announced at an event today hosted by Citibanamex and comes during a time of significant progress in LGBTQ workplace inclusion around the globe. In the coming months, Mexico-based HRC Equidad MX will collect responses to the survey, which will run parallel to HRC’s annual Corporate Equality Index (CEI) survey, and release the results during the Fall of 2017. The forthcoming report will evaluate major Mexican business and multinational companies on three core pillars of LGBT inclusion: Adoption of nondiscrimination policies; Creation of employee resource groups or diversity and inclusion councils; Engagement in public activities to support LGBT inclusion. Highly rated employers will receive a designation similar to the Best Places to Work certification offered through the CEI. “Businesses around the world continue to lead on LGBTQ equality,” said Mary Beth Maxwell, HRC’s Vice President for Programs, Research and Training. “From the companies taking the Equidad MX survey on inclusion to the HRC Global Business Coalition raising the bar, private sector partners around the world are sending a clear message that equality and inclusion are good for business.” Deena Fidas, Director of HRC’s Workplace Equality Program kicked off the partnership with Equidad MX partners Francisco Robledo and Fernando Velazquez at the 3rd Forum of Best Practices at the Workplace at Consejo para Prevenir y Eliminar la Discriminación de la Ciudad de México (COPRED), Mexico City’s Council to Prevent and Eradicate Discrimination. “Having these five important companies support this effort by the Human Rights Campaign represents a significant step in raising awareness of workplace equality among Mexican companies,” said Deena Fidas, Director of HRC’s Workplace Equality Program. “Mexico is a great commercial and social partner for the United States, and replicating the work we have done with companies over the past 15 years in the U.S. through our Corporate Equality Index will be a watershed moment for Mexican and multinational companies operating here.” “Citibanamex is an institution committed to giving the best of Mexico and the best in the world to our clients and employees. This commitment goes hand in hand with respect and job inclusion of the LGBT population,” said Liliana Iñigo, Citibanamex’s LGBT Ambassador for Latin America and Citibanamex’s Executive Director of Marketing. “We establish a culture that promotes integrity and confidence so that our collaborators can enhance their talent, regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Participating in the HRC Equidad MX certification shows the conviction we have to build the best working environment for the LGBT population in Mexico and in our Financial Group.” “Accenture is an inclusive company that promotes an environment of trust and motivates each one of its members to be authentic. We are proud to be a multinational firm that works every day to provide a fair work environment, regardless of the sexual orientation or gender identity of the people. With this, we formally declare our commitment to continue working towards the LGBT inclusion supported by the HRC Equity MX certification,” said Jorge Torres, Accenture’s Chief Technology Officer. “Google’s mission is to organize information and make it accessible and useful for everyone. In this sense, our search for diversity is a natural extension of this mission as we seek to increase access to opportunities, breaking down barriers and empowering people through technology,” said Delfina Grossi, Google Marketing Solutions Manager and Diversity Ambassador for Google Mexico. “Kellogg seeks to foster a culture of inclusion for all its employees and generate a work environment in which people are appreciated and can be authentic,” said Guillermo González Guerra, Director of Human Resources at Kellogg Latin America. “Through its K-Pride & Allies program, the company works to become the employer of choice for the LGBT community by promoting equity, solidarity and respect. Getting the HRC Equidad MX badge will be a very important step in this regard.” “Mastercard is proud to participate in HRC’s Global Business Coalition and to promote inclusive and diverse corporate culture with different actions that reinforce our commitment with our most important capital, the human and in the community in which we work,” said Brenda Hernandez, Director of Human Resources for Mastercard Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Accenture, Google and Mastercard are members of HRC’s Global Business Coalition, a cohort of global employers publicly committed to inclusion everywhere they do business. Through its Corporate Equality Index, the HRC Foundation has established a roadmap for the adoption of LGBTQ-inclusive policies, benefits and practices across major corporations. Last year, for the second year in a row, HRC launched its international CEI in Mexico City along with the U.S. Embassy in Mexico, The Dow Chemical Company, J.P. Morgan Chase, and the Mexican state-owned petroleum company, PEMEX. In conjunction with the launch of the 2017 CEI, HRC Equidad MX released a Spanish-language toolkit for workplaces in Mexico and around Latin America.  The guide provides predominantly Spanish-language workplaces with a resource to help train and equip employees to build LGBT-inclusive environments. HRC Equidad MX: Global Workplace Equality Program, which launched last year, works to increase awareness about the importance of LGBTQ diversity and inclusion in Mexico’s workplaces by developing consulting and education models for Mexican companies and organizations. It also utilizes HRC’s tools and relationships to engage interested companies in aligning their corporate policies on LGBTQ inclusion to international standards.

Our light bulbs speak to the internet, and our connected speakers stream from there, and we can adjust our thermostats from halfway around the world. When we’re actually at home, though, actually having to pull out a phone or tablet to do something as simple as turning on the light is an oddly involved process. It’s also something startup Brilliant Home Technology believes it has the answer to. When you call your company “Brilliant” you have to be pretty confident in what you’re selling, but from playing briefly with the two-year-old startup’s first product I suspect it’s more than just ego. Brilliant’s goal is to drag the light switch into the 21st century connected home, by replacing it with a touchscreen and voice control. The Brilliant Control fits into the space on the wall where you’d usually expect to find a traditional light switch. Instead of that, though, you get a 5-inch 720 x 1280 touchscreen. It fits a single-gang box perfectly, but there are two, three, and four-gang versions as well: they add touch-sensitive programable strips alongside the display. The obvious route would’ve been to take an existing Android device and figure out a way to mount it on the wall. That idea, Brilliant’s chief product officer Scott Dunlap explained to me, was quickly dismissed. While Android devices may be flexible, they also tend to bury their options and controls in layers of menus and tabs. In contrast, Brilliant wanted to surface as much as possible, so that using the touchscreen would be as immediate as using a physical switch. Instead, the company developed its own platform, built on Linux. Since it’s wired into the 110V power that would’ve been supplying the regular switch, it can keep its WiFi and Bluetooth radios on all the time; power consumption in standby, Dunlap says, is around thirty cents of electricity per month. You can opt to have the various screensavers appear when the display isn’t in use, or have the screen power down. Out of the box, there’s support for Philips Hue, Nest’s thermostat and cameras, Sonos‘ speakers, various connected locks, and other devices. However, Brilliant will also work with IFTTT along with hubs like Samsung’s SmartThings, opening the door to a much broader range of devices. There are also three voice assistants to choose between. Brilliant offers voice-activated control of Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant, but the company also has its own agent. While that might seem like needless duplication, it’s actually in recognition of the fact that neither Google nor Amazon’s services are quite up to speed with home automation use, Dunlap explained to me. For instance, to use the Google Assistant to switch on lights as you come into the room, you’d have to say “Ok Google, tell Brilliant to turn on the lights in the living room.” Brilliant’s version, though, knows where you are because it knows where the control panel is installed; all you’d need say is “Hey Brilliant, turn on the lights.” In the future, you’ll be able to rename the agent, too; if you’ve ever wanted your own Iron Man Jarvis, here’s your chance. Brilliant designed the Control to play nicely with multiple units, but not be dependent on the cloud. After high-profile hub shutdowns like Revolv – which was acquired by Google and then promptly bricked – I was eager to find out just how Brilliant was handling the situation. Turns out, even if the company disappears the controllers will all keep working; the only cloud service that’s involved handles the authentication of the mobile app for iOS and Android, if you’re trying to log in remotely. There are other safeguards. If the WiFi goes down, for instance, Brilliant switches over to Bluetooth for inter-controller communication. If the Bluetooth stops working, you can still use the touchscreen to turn the lights on and off. That just requires a swipe up or down anywhere on the screen. Installation does demand that you turn the power off – electrocution isn’t much fun – but once turned on the Control will automatically go scanning for any smart home tech it can find. From there it’s a case of punching in your account credentials as required, either from the touchscreen itself or through your phone, and assigning different items to the room they’re in. Subsequent Brilliant panels will copy the configuration across, so that you only need go through it once. If you have multiple homes, you can switch between them in the app. Each Brilliant Control automatically shows home screen buttons for the most relevant devices in the room. If you have Sonos speakers, for instance, the music shortcut will be front and center, allowing you to pick from playlists or channels, and then control playback and volume. Other devices are a further tap away, including things in other rooms. A motion sensor above the display can trigger devices or scenes made up of multiple actions when you walk in. There’s also a camera that allows you to use Brilliant as a video intercom; a physical privacy slider can cover it up, if you’re coy. Eventually, Dunlap tells me, Brilliant might add support for “video Post-It notes”, messages you could leave for others to find when they get home. For now, it’s a quick way to communicate between controllers or with the companion app. The sliders can be assigned to whatever you prefer, whether just controlling dimming in the room or adjusting the light of a whole group of Hue bulbs. Alternatively, you could map it to Sonos volume, or something else. Brilliant isn’t expecting to ship in earnest until around September this year. However, it’s had units in public test homes since last November, gathering feedback about how people actually use the Control panel. Turns out, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, though with a few surprises along the way. For a start, connected device use rises after Brilliant is installed. Sonos owners, for instance, apparently use their speakers around 30-percent more. However where the company expected voice control to be the dominant method, in fact 85-percent of interactions are completed through the touchscreen. Alexa use does increase the more Brilliant controllers are installed, but primarily for answering questions rather than operating smart home devices. I’m a big fan of connected home tech, but have long been frustrated by the options on the market to actually control it. All too often the smartphone is made into the universal remote. That can be great if you’re trying to complete a complex task, but it’s seriously lacking in that important spousal-approval factor when all you want is to switch on the lights or pause your music. So far, Logitech’s POP buttons have been my go-to for addressing that, but while they’re flexible they can only do so much. In contrast, Brilliant’s controllers demand a little more work for the setup, but neatly bridge the familiar old light switch paradigm and the brave – and confusing – new world we’re seeing of hundreds of different connected devices from many different manufacturers. At $199 for a single-gang unit – rising in $50 increments until you get to the $349 four-gang – they’re actually cheap in comparison to the previous embedded touchscreen controller options, which usually demands a custom installer come out and fit you a bespoke system. That can set you back tens of thousands of dollars, so it’s unsurprising that Brilliant saw strong demand in its limited preorder phase in February. The company isn’t saying exactly how many were bought, but Dunlap did reveal that the typical number per buyer was 2-5; one early-adopter splashed out on around seventy, to spread across his four different properties. If you’re interested, Control sales should open up again later this year.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube Google has made a product called the Jamboard which is aimed at enterprise customers that want their employees to work together and collaborate with their teammates for enhanced creativity. Jamboard is a cloud-based collaborative whiteboard that Google has made just for this purpose. It’s now available for purchase in the United States. Whiteboards have long been a fixture in offices for the purposes of collaboration. Who hasn’t used a dry erase marker in brainstorming sessions with their teammates? Google wants to modernize collaborative brainstorming with Jamboard. Jamboard is powered by NVIDIA’s Jetson TX1 chip and has a 55 inch 4K touchscreen display. The display has been developed for fast touch response and low-latency stylus input. It works with G Suite to bring in all files and documents from Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides. This enables all team members to work together simultaneously. The price tag itself is enough to show that this is meant for enterprise customers. At $5000, it isn’t exactly cheap, and that’s just the starting price. A rolling stand costs $1199, if the customer doesn’t want to mount it on a wall. There’s even a $300 yearly fee over and above the fee for the G Suite enterprise apps. Google tested the Jamboard with enterprise early adopters like Pinterest, Dow Jones, and Whirpool and they found that the Jamboard helped their teams collaborate more efficiently. Jamboard is available for purchase in the United States today and will be released in Canada and the United Kingdom in a few months. Filed in Gadgets. Read more about Google.

Photo: Jefferson Siegel/NY Daily News via Getty Images Some companies have ethics hotlines for employees to register harassment and bias complaints, while others encourage workers to go to human resources if they’ve witnessed harassment or discrimination. But at Google, a group of employees has taken a different approach: They’ve created an employee-run email newsletter to collect anonymous allegations, and nearly 20 percent of the company’s workforce is subscribed, Bloomberg reports. As Bloomberg reports, more than 15,000 employees of Google and its parent company, Alphabet Inc., are part of a weekly email list called “Yes, at Google,” which started in October. The list is a grassroots effort to collect and track allegations of inappropriate behavior at the company, and it’s being run by unnamed workers across different product areas. Google management is aware that the list exists, though they don’t “control or influence” the emails’ content. Bloomberg notes that the people in the complaints are usually not identified by name, though job titles and other details are occasionally included. For instance, a recent “Yes, at Google” email from May included a complaint against a HR manager who allegedly joked “about raping one of his direct reports” before getting promoted, and another claimed that “a colleague started a meeting off by making a joke that called a woman in the adjacent meeting room ‘some random bitch,’” according to Bloomberg. Another person alleged that a new employee was told by an engineer that she was expected to “‘sleep with everyone’ because that’s the culture here,” while another lodged a complaint to explain why certain jokes made in the office are offensive to others. Google is currently under investigation by the Department of Labor for allegedly drastically underpaying its female employees — an allegation Google denies — while the tech industry on the whole has faced allegations of lacking racial and gender diversity. According to Bloomberg, the email list’s title is meant to show that, yes, unfair treatment happens at Google. With the newsletter, Google employees are seemingly trying to push for change, while Google executives have “touted the list internally as a way that Google is trying to make its workplace welcome to all kinds of employees,” Bloomberg reports.

Tech News | 22 May 2017 | Print  | Comment (5) Google Aims to Attract Apple Users with Google I/O Announcements by Julio Ojeda-Zapata Comparisons between Apple and Google are inescapable now that the two increasingly play in the same categories: smartphones, voice assistants, home automation, photo sharing, and so on. In recent years, Apple and Google have invited such comparisons with dueling springtime press events that reveal products and services intended to compete for consumer hearts and pocketbooks (see “Google I/O 2016 Includes Announcements with Apple Appeal,” 23 May 2016). This year, the cycle is repeating. Google last week took over an outdoor amphitheater in Mountain View, California, to unleash a torrent of tech news during its Google I/O keynote, which precedes Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference in nearby San Jose by less than a month. Much of what Google announced is relevant to Apple users. For instance, Google’s voice-controlled Assistant app has finally come to the iPhone to go up against Apple’s Siri. Many photography enthusiasts prefer the Google Photos service over Apple’s iCloud Photo Library, and Google announced a number of upgrades in that department. Angst about Apple falling behind is an inevitable byproduct of every Google I/O keynote. As the absence of a Siri device similar to Amazon’s popular Echo voice-controlled gadgets becomes ever more glaring, Google announced improvements to its Echo competitor, the Google Home. Rumors have lately swirled about an Apple reveal at WWDC, but we will have to wait and see whether the mythical Siri Speaker actually exists. Here is a look at Google I/O announcements that intersect with Apple in some fashion. Note that some of the products, services, and technologies mentioned below aren’t available immediately but are coming soon. Google Assistant -- Siri has its limitations, as iOS-device owners will attest. Fortunately, there are alternatives. Amazon brought its Alexa voice assistant, the one built into Echo devices, to the iPhone last March, via an update to the company’s Amazon App for iOS. Now, Google Assistant has come to the iPhone as well. Unsurprisingly, the Google Assistant iOS app is just an app, unlike its deeper integration on Android-based devices. Given that Siri can be invoked with a press of the Home button at any time, Apple still has a significant advantage in iOS. But iPhone users who already rely on other Google services, or are just frustrated with Siri, may find Google’s new voice app tempting. Google Assistant has a chat-like interface (familiar to the handful of iPhone users who have installed Google’s Allo chat app) and can be manipulated with either voice commands or by typing, for those embarrassed by vocalized directives. There’s a shortcut widget in Notification Center, for added convenience. Google Assistant is handy for requesting workout tunes; getting stock updates or the news; accessing YouTube or Netflix videos; making Google keyword searches; getting directions; initiating calls, texts, and emails; and much more. But Google Assistant’s lack of full iPhone integration means you cannot invoke it by voice or a press of the Home button, access low-level functions like Airplane Mode, and so on. Access to non-Google apps is clunky, when it’s available at all. If you aren’t heavily invested in the Google ecosystem, Google Assistant may be more trouble than it is worth. The fact that the main Google search app is separate from and partly redundant with the Google Assistant app makes things more confusing. And while you can use the Google Assistant app on the iPad, it’s not tablet-native. Google Assistant should improve, though, as Google now makes it possible for developers to add capabilities via an SDK. These, interestingly, include appliance maker General Electric. There’s even an extension to let Google Assistant control Philips Hue lights (see “Getting Started with the Philips Hue Smart Light Bulbs,” 1 August 2016). Google Home -- Google was playing catch-up with Amazon’s popular Echo at last year’s Google I/O when it announced its voice-controlled Google Home gadget. That product did not become available to the public until months later, and in many respects still lags behind the Echo. For Apple users who are invested in Google’s ecosystem, though, the Google Home may have more appeal than an Echo device. This year’s improvements increase the allure. Such enhancements include an option to make outgoing (and, in the United States, free) calls to landline and cellular phones, essentially turning the Google Home into a speakerphone. You can even associate your phone number with it, but you can’t receive calls for now. Another new feature called “proactive assistance” pushes relevant information to users – calendar reminders and traffic updates, for instance – without being asked. Google Home has been tweaked to work better with Chromecast-capable televisions, too. You can initiate programming from the likes of HBO GO. More interesting is how Google Home can display responses to your questions on the TV screen, such as your calendar or a map with driving directions. Some responses just don’t work in audio form, so having a screen on which to display information can be a big win. Google Photos -- Google’s photo-sharing service debuted at Google I/O two years ago and has since been a top priority for the company. Users have seen a steady flow of upgrades, which are available to iOS- and Android-device owners via apps as well as those accessing the service via desktop Web browsers. To enhance the service, Google last week rolled out a new batch of enhancements that are largely focused on sharing. Most notable is a Suggested Sharing feature that picks out what it thinks are the best photos from an event, identifies people in those photos, and offers to send the right shots to the right people. It will even nudge recipients to add their own photos of the same event. A Shared Libraries feature provides a different sort of sharing automation. It lets you automatically share photos with a particular person like a spouse or a best friend. That person can get access to your full library, just shots of certain people, or only photos from a given date forward. They can also access and save “creations” (collages, animated GIFs, slideshows) made from the shots, either manually by you or automatically by Google. One Google Photos announcement is a catch-up maneuver. Google Photo users can now order customized hardcover or softcover photo books, an option that had long been available to users of Apple’s Photos and similar services, including, at one time, Google Photos predecessor Picasa Web Albums. Google Lens -- This isn’t a product or feature but, rather, a technology that will augment the capabilities of Google’s services – starting, the company said, with Google Assistant and Google Photos. Google describes Google Lens as “a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you are looking at and help you take action based on that information.” You’ll be able to point your smartphone camera at a flower, for instance, and have Google Assistant identify it for you. Likewise, you could aim your phone at a storefront to get information and reviews about that establishment. Also, Google Lens will enable Google Assistant to analyze the significance of text in useful ways, such as translating foreign languages on menus or logging you into Wi-Fi networks if it can see and parse corresponding SSIDs and passwords. Google Photos is already somewhat competent at identifying people, animals, objects, places, and so on, and that capability should improve as Google Lens learns to recognize more images. Virtual Reality -- This another tech category that makes pundits wonder what Apple is doing, especially as Google and others push aggressively into the space. At last year’s Google I/O, Google announced VR goggles meant to be used with Android smartphones, as well as Daydream technology built into the latest such phones to boost their VR capabilities. This year, Google is taking another VR step, announcing specifications for standalone VR goggles that require neither a smartphone nor a tethered connection a desktop computer, as some high-end VR goggles do. Google is working with hardware partners like HTC and Lenovo to make these devices happen. Gmail Smart Replies -- Google provides iOS users two ways to access their Gmail accounts: its traditional Gmail app and the alternative Inbox app that provides a different interface. Inbox has long had “smart replies” with auto-generated text snippets to let users answer email messages with just a tap. This feature is now making its way to the older, more popular Gmail app for iOS. Looking Forward to WWDC -- This is an exciting time of year in consumer technology because of events like Google I/O and WWDC that give us a better sense of how these tech titans are competing for new users. Make no mistake, Google and Apple are in a struggle for the ages, and they’re not alone, with Amazon and Microsoft trying to appeal to tech consumers as well (see “New Microsoft OS and Laptop Aim at Apple and Google in Education,” 3 May 2017). Our gaze is now focused on San Jose, and on what Tim Cook and crew have to show us on 5 June 2017 during the WWDC keynote.   Fujitsu ScanSnap Scanners — Save your business time and money with our easy-to-use small ScanSnap Scanner line.

Especially VR, a product which researchers say the interested user can stand for about three minutes at a time. That's the kind of product Apple needs, right now! Reply Dennis B. Swaney  2017-05-23 00:24 Google is the antithesis of Apple as it is predicated on violating user privacy; created a very buggy and insecure OS in Android, and is living up to its motto "DO Do Evil". Reply Jack Smith  2017-05-23 09:58 Thought the most impressive thing saw at Google I/O was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2VF8tmLFHw&feature=youtu.be&t=10m43s Google is just killing it in AI. The 2nd generation TPUs faster than anything commercially available while using far less power. We see that TensorFlow has already 58k stars on GitHub. Suggest the AI framework battles are over. Then Linkedin share the most desired place to work is Google. Google is winning in all the dimensions to AI. Cherry on top is Google just beat the #1 Go player in the world in China earlier this morning!! 10 years earlier than what was thought to be possible. Brute force not possible so Google AI is using intuition. Reply Duane Williams   2017-05-23 12:40 RE: "But Google Assistant’s lack of full iPhone integration means you cannot invoke it by voice" Yes, you can. "Hey, Siri, open Assistant." Reply Adam Engst   2017-05-23 15:26 It's not the same thing, and you know it. :-) It's five steps instead of one: 1) "Hey Siri, open Assistant." 2) "You'll need to unlock your iPhone first. 3) unlock iphone 4) tap mic icon in Assistant 5) ask question Reply  Search   Unless otherwise noted, this article is copyright © 2017 Julio Ojeda-Zapata TidBITS is copyright © 2017 TidBITS Publishing Inc.

Well, today, it’s available for all the business big dogs in the building to consider buying. Why you would want Jamboard and what is it, you ask? Think of Jamboard as the ultimate whiteboard that your crappy conference room might have, except its not a whiteboard – it’s a cloud-powered 55-inch 4K tablet. Seriously, watch the video above and you’ll get it.  With Jamboard, you have a 55-inch 4K display with 120Hz touch scan and 60Hz refresh rate that allows for 16 simultaneous touch points. There are Type-C and HDMI ports, 802.11ac WiFi, NFC, Gigabyte ethernet, Google Cast, wide angle camera, and speakers and microphones on board. You also get a fancy eraser, couple of passive stylus pens that look like big fun pieces of chalk, and a microfiber cloth to wipe it down. It comes in red, blue, and gray colorways. Jamboard allows people in the same room to collaborate via a giant touch screen, but its cloud connectivity stores all of those happenings automatically in the cloud, while also letting remote users chime in via tablet or smartphone. You can crop web pages and include them, hand-write items, toss in stickers and sticky notes, insert Google Docs and images, etc. It actually looks pretty sweet. Of course, the price here is going to be the make-or-break piece of this, right? Yeah, so about that. Google Jamboard starts at $5,000 for the big 55-inch 4K monitor only. If you want a fancy wheeled stand to go with it, that’ll cost you another $1,200 if you buy one before 9/30/17 ($1,349 after). That’s not all, though. There is a subscription that runs $300 per year if you sign-up before 9/30/17 ($600 after) and you’ll have to have a G Suite account that also costs your company cash. So just to get into the Jamboard for a full year, you are looking at a $6,500 investment at minimum. Cool! Who wants one, or five? You can buy one right here.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 71 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares188 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma.

You can already share digital content (Android apps, TV shows, movies, and ebooks) from the Play Store with up to 5 people in your family — and there’s also a family plan for the company’s subscription music service. But today Google is expanding family sharing to also include Google Calendar, Keep, and Photos. We heard about Google’s big plans for Photos at I/O last week, but this is just a small addition. A new “Family group” option will appear when you go to share a photo or album, so you can get those images and videos to multiple people in a few taps rather than sending them individually. Google Keep works much the same way. You can add your family group as a collaborator for any note, letting everyone edit and make changes to shopping lists, to-dos, and so on. The family icon — a house with a heart in the center — will appear next to any notes being shared with your family members. And while shared Google Calendars are nothing new, now a “Family” calendar will automatically be created once you’ve set up a family group. Non-family members can’t be invited to join this calendar, but you can still invite them to events. The new family features for Calendar, Keep, and Photos will start to roll out today in the following countries: Australia Brazil Canada France Germany Ireland Italy Japan Mexico New Zealand Russia Spain UK US Next Up In Tech Amazon Echo Dot flash deal: $10 off, today only Apple reportedly plans to perform 5G internet tests in Cupertino Prynt made another printer that turns photos into AR video experiences This outrageous skydiving video is the Switch ad Nintendo should have made Honor’s new wearable includes a heart rate sensor and OLED display for only $30 Intel's $399 Euclid computer has a depth camera and everything else you need to build a robot Now Trending Ikea's cheap smart lighting will be Apple HomeKit, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa compatible Coming this summer and fall Microsoft's new Surface Pro has 13.5 hours of battery life and LTE option Available on June 15th starting at $799 An interview with alleged KickassTorrents founder in his jail cell in Poland Vaulin had been held at Warsaw-Bialoleka Investigative Detention Center with little contact to the outside world for 10 months Command Line Command Line delivers daily updates from the near-future. email address...

Columnist Wesley Young explains why this isn't the good idea that it may seem to be. Wesley Young on May 22, 2017 at 11:15 am More Why are we still having this discussion? Because data show that a surprising number of businesses still don’t have a website. Surveys from as recently as October 2016 find that close to half of all small businesses don’t have a website, and it’s not just solo work-from-home moonlighters, either. Specifically, a Capital One survey of 400 small businesses  — its Fall 2016 Small Business Barometer Survey — found that only 56 percent have a company website. And only 53 percent of those were mobile-optimized. In other words, fewer than 30 percent of businesses surveyed had a mobile-optimized website. Further, there is a fair argument that websites are no longer as effective in the local market. Technology and cost certainly are no longer barriers given the availability of subscription options for even the least sophisticated users and slick DIY platforms for those who don’t want to hire a freelancer or agency. Instead, the challenge is that websites must compete for relevance in a market with many other media platforms — social media sites, directories and review sites — that are often viewed as proxies for the face of the franchise. Today, social media is dominating SMB attention, a survey conducted by the Local Search Association (my employer) has found. Almost 43 percent of SMBs surveyed said that it would be the media of choice if they could only select one form of online marketing to use. That was the top choice by a large margin, with SEO ranking second at 25.6 percent. This preference explains why social media pages such as Facebook pages are increasingly used as the primary public-facing “landing page.” Other “proxy” home pages include directory listings that are sophisticated enough to contain virtually all the key information customers are looking for. Third-party sites can integrate multiple functions such as e-commerce, online booking and reviews and attract a bigger and broader audience than an individual website. And even Google profiles, knowledge graphs and snack-pack listings can suck huge amounts of traffic away from a website. All in all, median click-through-rate (CTR) from a #1 result on Google is down 37 percent over the last two years, according to a study by Wordstream. That seems like pretty strong evidence fewer people are visiting websites and are instead relying on other media. While these reasons are seemingly enough to persuade some that third-party-owned pages are a sufficient and simpler alternative to maintaining a business website, other data reveal a different story. Below are five reasons why every business needs a company website for local search marketing. 1. 63% of consumers use websites to find or engage with businesses According to LSA’s (Local Search Association) April 2017 report, “The Digital Consumer Study,” that examined digital media use in 12 US cities, websites were the second most-used media to find local businesses. Only two forms of media were used by the majority of consumers when looking at “past week” usage trends: search engines and company websites. Consumers use websites to find or engage with businesses 63 percent of the time. And while the perception is that the variety of media available to consumers would decrease website use, LSA’s numbers show something different — 2016’s weekly website usage rate of 63 percent was an increase over 2015’s 60 percent rate. These numbers show that despite the growth of other media, the value of websites has not diminished – in fact, it continues to grow. While Wordstream’s study showed a decline in CTR from Google SERPs (search engine results pages), consumers are finding and clicking through to business websites from other sources such as Yelp, YellowPages.com and Google My Business listings. 2. The top 10 local organic factors for SEO are related to websites Only 5 percent of consumers surveyed by BrightLocal in 2016 never used search engines to find local businesses — which means 95 percent have. And 69 percent reported searching for a local business at least six times per year. So SEO is a big deal. According to Moz’s 2017 Local Search Ranking Factors, the top 10 factors for appearing in organic Google search results are related to a business’s website or domain. These factors include how authoritative your website is, based on who is linking to your site, how many third parties are linking to you and the quality and relevance of your content, to name a few. While arguably, these factors can be fulfilled on a Facebook page, realistically, that doesn’t happen. For one thing, a major factor — authority of the site — is difficult to achieve on a social media site, since Google doesn’t consider social signals such as likes or followers in weighing influence. I performed a few test searches on Google of snorkel gear, ski equipment and pool supplies in Plano and Frisco, Texas, and found only two Facebook pages of local businesses — and they were deep into the search results. In both cases, the Facebook pages appeared many results after the respective websites of those businesses. Note that I’m not talking about searches in which a business’s name is specifically typed into the search box. Those results commonly return Facebook pages, Yelp listings and Groupon offers. However, since finding new customers is the top marketing priority for businesses, according to a Unity Marketing survey last year, businesses can’t count on folks who already know their name and proactively search for it. Maintaining a website that has quality and relevant content that is consistently referenced and linked by other reputable third-party directories, sites, articles and posts is critical to being found when customers conduct research online and are looking for products and services to buy. 3. Local snack-pack and Google map results are influenced by websites, too According to Moz, the biggest impact on local pack ranking factors is your Google My Business (GMB) profile and the proximity of your business to the searcher. Yet having a complete and rich GMB profile does not guarantee you will show up in Google local finder or map results. Businesses often make the mistake of assuming that you’ll automatically show up in searches for your business category (as listed in your GMB profile) in your geographic area. Despite the fact that proximity, physical address and GMB business category rank 1, 2 and 3 in Moz’s local pack ranking factors, Google often lists businesses that are not in the initial search area while omitting results that would otherwise match the search, deeming those other results more authoritative. It’s not just new or small businesses that are affected, either; big brands can struggle with this, too. Some of the factors that affect organic SEO rankings — such as backlinks, domain authority and clicks — are also essential to ranking and appearing in Google local finder and map results. Also, I’ve found that having location-based information on your website and linking to that source from your GMB profile can help boost local search results. 4. 30% of consumers won’t consider a business without a website Just because someone looks at your Facebook page or reads reviews on Yelp doesn’t mean they don’t also want to see your website. In fact, consumers typically rely on multiple sources to gather information before making a purchase decision. Research by YP and LSA found that, on average, consumers use approximately three sources before making an individual purchase decision. And 30 percent automatically strike a business from consideration if they don’t have a website. Thus, those businesses that don’t have a website experience a significant loss of ready-to-buy, high-intent potential customers. 5. 46% say a website is the biggest determinant of whether they trust a company Consumers may find you on Facebook, Google Maps or Yelp, but one big part of your online reputation comes from your website. Research conducted at Stanford in 2002 (PDF) found that 46 percent of consumers made their decision about a website’s credibility based upon its design, layout and typography. Listings may provide business details, and reviews give other customers’ opinions, but on a website, prospective customers hear directly from you about you. Facebook and other social media provide a partial view of your business, but the ability to personalize the design is extremely limited, and your information is presented in a format that’s the same for everyone. A website is a storefront that reflects your identity and allows your consumers to form opinions on the quality of your products or services, the trustworthiness of your business and whether you are someone they want to buy from. It is especially important for services. According to a study from the e-tailing Group and Oracle (PDF), 75 percent of consumers say the quality of product images is essential in selecting and purchasing products online. For services, a website is your product image. Closing thoughts It may seem easy as marketers and agencies to just do what our clients want. Yet marketing decisions that SMBs make may be based on incomplete or out-of-context information. For example, an SMB may look at the time consumers spend on social media and quickly conclude that its marketing resources should be spent in proportion to that social media use. Or an SMB may make an even bigger mistake and decide that it can rely solely on social media. I’m not bashing social media as a marketing tool. However, it behooves us as marketers to educate our clients and make sure they understand the context of data they use to make decisions. We should help our clients look deeper into consumer trends and come away with better insights to make good decisions. One of those is to avoid sacrificing websites in favor of social media or other media in local search marketing. Websites remain a critical part of local search and are essential for attracting the customers necessary for business growth.

Read More , then you’re really missing out on some of the other cool things the app is capable of. From supercharged searching to integration with your navigation software, Spotify has loads of extra features you may not know about but really should start using. Here’s our pick of the best. 1. Advanced Searches You can really hone in on the music you want to listen to by using search operators in the Spotify app. You can limit your search results to specific artists, albums, years, or genres, or only see new releases. Some of the operators you’ll want to use include: artist:[name] — See only results from the artist (e.g. artist:”david bowie”). track:[name] — See only tracks with that title (e.g. track:heroes). album:[name] — See only albums with that title (e.g. album:”station to station”). year:[year] or year:[year-year] — See only releases from that year or range of years (e.g. year:1974 or year:1972–1978). AND, OR, or NOT — See results containing both, either, or exclude one (e.g. bowie AND queen). tag:new — See new releases. genre:alternative — See only results tagged with a specific genre. For even more specific results you can combine several operators in a single search (e.g. artist:”david bowie” year:1970–2016 NOT year:1981–2010). There are a couple more, such as for the label that released a record. Check the Spotify website for the full list. 2. GPS Integration If you use your phone for GPS navigation Smartphone vs Sat Nav: Should You Buy a Dedicated GPS Device? Smartphone vs Sat Nav: Should You Buy a Dedicated GPS Device? Is there still a good reason to buy a dedicated in-car sat nav, or a handheld GPS for outdoor use? Read More and also listen to Spotify in the car, you’ll know how awkward it is when you have to switch between the two apps. Spotify’s integration with the Google-owned Waze navigation app Waze vs. Google Maps: Which App Will Navigate Home Faster Waze vs. Google Maps: Which App Will Navigate Home Faster Waze and Google Maps are both solid navigation apps, but which one is the best? Read More takes care of that. The two work together seamlessly. You can keep Waze as your foreground app, and get Spotify music controls overlaid at the top of the screen. Or keep Spotify in the foreground and see your next turn from Waze in the overlay. It is so simple and requires almost no setup or configuration. Just activate the feature in the Spotify settings, install Waze, and you’re good to go. 3. Running Spotify Running was announced with some fanfare a few years ago, so it’s a surprise that it’s so well hidden in the app. The feature offers up a series of dynamic playlists — either curated or culled from your own favorites How to Make Spotify Recommend Music You'll Enjoy How to Make Spotify Recommend Music You'll Enjoy In this article we give you five tips for making Spotify get to know you better. These should help Spotify's algorithms recommend music better suited to your personal tastes. Read More — to accompany you on your daily run. The clever bit is that the app uses your phone’s sensors to measure how fast you’re running. It then picks tunes with the tempo to match. To use Running, go to Browse > Playlists > Running then pick a playlist. 4. Interface Shortcuts It isn’t that hard to find your way around the Spotify app, though there are a few hidden shortcuts that can take you places even quicker. Double-tapping the Search button in the bottom bar not only opens the Search screen, but launches your keyboard too. In the Now Playing screen, tap the song title to jump straight to the album it is featured on. Swipe down in the Playlist or Your Music screen to see various filtering options. These include being able to see only the playlists you’ve downloaded for offline use. The same swiping gesture within a playlist enables you to sort the tracks. And the long-press is supported almost everywhere. Instead of trying to accurately tap the tiny three-dots button, tap and hold on any track for a whole host of options to appear. 5. Lyrics At the time of writing, the Android Spotify app does not have full, built-in support for song lyrics. For a few select tracks and albums, it does give you lyrics and trivia from the Genius service. Called Behind the Lyrics, it pops up on top of the album art on the Now Playing screen whenever it’s available. A better solution is to install the Genius app from the Play Store. You can set this up to automatically detect what track is playing, and display the lyrics for you. Also check out Musixmatch, which does the same thing. Both apps are free. 6. Podcasts There are lots of excellent podcast apps for Android The 8 Best Podcast Players for Android The 8 Best Podcast Players for Android Want to listen to podcasts on your Android phone or tablet? Let us show you which apps to use. Read More , and for the serious podcast enthusiast we’d recommend them all over Spotify. But for the casual listener, Spotify works a treat. The selection is fine, if not as comprehensive as you’ll find elsewhere. And there’s some convenience in having music and podcasts all built into the same app. The Android app can also be used for listening to podcasts in the desktop app, which you cannot normally do. Load up a show on your phone, then click the Connect to a device button and select your computer (you need to have Spotify installed and running on that machine too). 7. Remote Control The Connect to a device option, which you find in the Now Playing screen, can also be used to turn your Spotify app into a remote control for another device How to Make Spotify the Default Music Player on Amazon Echo How to Make Spotify the Default Music Player on Amazon Echo There are many ways to listen to music with an Amazon Echo, but if you're subscribed to Spotify then you may want to set it as your default player. Read More . When you’re listening to Spotify on another device, like your PC, TV, or PS4, you should keep the app open on your phone. You can then use the app to see what track is playing, skip forward and back, and queue up new playlists. 8. Autoplay With tens of millions of tracks to stream, there’s no reason why your music should stop just because you’ve reached the end of your playlist. That’s the premise of Autoplay. Once the last song in your playlist has ended, it will automatically continue playing similar types of music, until you decide to stop it. Autoplay should be enabled by default, but if it isn’t, head into Settings to turn it on. 9. Sound Settings Many people stick to an app’s default setup, but Spotify has a few extra options that can improve your listening experience. They’re all found in Settings, and the first to look at is Crossfade. Found under Playback, Crossfade fades the current track out and the next one in, and is disabled by default. To reduce the amount of silence between songs enable it and set it to a couple of seconds. For a continuous mix at a party set a longer crossfade duration of 10 or 12 seconds. Just below that is Normalize volume. This should be turned on by default, and is recommended. Normalize plays all tracks at roughly the same volume level. Finally, towards the bottom of the screen is Equalizer. Tapping this opens a new panel and enables you to adjust the audio output The Best 4 Android Equalizer Apps for Great Audio The Best 4 Android Equalizer Apps for Great Audio Whether you're listening to songs or podcasts on your Android device, you need one of these awesome equalizer apps. Read More to match your preferred style. Pro Tip: When using an equalizer, try lowering the sliders rather than raising them, which can introduce distortion. For example, to increase the bass and treble, you would just reduce the midrange levels. 10. Reduce Data Usage If you aren’t careful, Spotify can eat through your phone’s data plan How to Use Less Data (and Save Money on Your Android Phone Bill) How to Use Less Data (and Save Money on Your Android Phone Bill) If you're using an Android phone and want to use less data to save money, these tips will help you out. Read More in no time. Thankfully, it has a few settings you can tweak to help prevent that. First, download music to listen offline. Open a playlist or album and tap the slider next to Download. Next, limit yourself to only listening to downloaded music by going into Settings and putting the app into Offline mode. You’ll need to deactivate it again and connect at least once every 30 days to keep access to your downloaded tracks. To carry on streaming, but minimize your data usage, go to Settings > Music Quality and set Streaming quality to Normal. Also check that Download using cellular is set to Off. 11. Social Sharing Spotify is great for sharing your taste in music. It has built-in support for Facebook and the music discovery service Last.fm. If you want to disconnect your Spotify account from Facebook, by the way, you can only do it through the desktop app. Don’t want to share what you’re listening to right now? Go into Settings and select Private Session. It’s also easy to manually share what you’re listening to, with a link, to other online services. Tap the three-dot menu button next to a track or album and select Share, then choose where and how you want to share. Posting to Facebook or Twitter automatically adds #NowPlaying. Your Favorite Features? There’s so much more to Spotify than might be immediately obvious. Some of the lesser known features help the app integrate into almost every part of your life. What are your favorite features in the Spotify app and what would you love to see added in the future? Join us in the comments to share your thoughts.

This new feature will give users more information about the content inside an image. As it turns out, the Pinterest app is testing a similar feature, also called Lens. Today, it announced a new feature for Lens beta that should help people learn how to make great meals via photos. See also: Best cooking apps and recipe apps for Android July 7, 2016 In a blog post, the company said the Lens beta feature in the Pinterest app can already recognize objects in over 750 categories in images. Now with this update, the Lens beta can take an image of a food dish and generate ideas of how to recreate it by finding online recipes. The update also now allows users to narrow down recipe searches by time, diet and the ingredients you have in your home. Finally, the new update to the Pinterest app will now show star-based ratings of its recipe listings. Those ratings come from food expert websites like Epicurious, Martha Stewart, and Food Network. Those reviews might also contain extra tips to make sure your version is as good as theirs.

Rahul Matthan Social media companies have long understood the advantage of accurate facial recognition—the more skilful they get at identifying friends and acquaintances within images, the better is their ability to understand the web of our social connections. Photo: AFP One of the concerns around the use of biometrics for identity is the fear that since they represent physical features that are unique to each of us, their misuse represents a threat to personal privacy. As a result we are instinctively reluctant to trust something so personal into the hands of the government for fear that if, due to a failure of state capacity, this information is compromised, it will cause us irremediable harm. If biometrics are going to be the key to our digital identities, there is an apprehension that criminal elements who figure out how to get their hands on them will be able to steal our identity. At present, fingerprints and iris scans are the government’s biometrics of choice. They are, both individually and in combination, capable of uniquely identifying us from the rest of humanity. While there have been claims that all it takes to capture your fingerprints is the application of Fevicol on your fingers, it is hard to conceive of situations in which someone can actually apply that glue on your hands without your knowledge. These biometrics therefore have an inherent, non-trivial barrier to collection that is an effective defence against ambient capture. Even though the government may have chosen to limit itself to fingerprints and iris, these are, by no means, the only biometric markers that are being used to identify you. At least one of the other biometric currently in use is more pervasive and infinitely more worrying. Last week Google announced the launch of Google Lens, a product that integrates the smartphone camera with Google’s core search functionality—allowing the company’s proven expertise in text and web search to extend to photos and videos. It works with Google Assistant so that when you look at something through your camera, the artificial intelligence infers what it is you might want to know about it. For instance, if you are at a historical landmark, all you need to do is point your phone in its general direction and Lens will cross reference your location with its analysis of the image and provide you with detailed historical information about what you are looking from its data banks. Thanks to this ability to dynamically parse images in a way that has, so far been reserved for text, Lens allows us to interact with the physical world far more intuitively than before. It should not come as a surprise to anyone that Google has this sort of technology at its command. We’ve known for a while that all the big tech giants have been focussed on improving their image recognition technology. We have witnessed the results of these endeavours ourselves as the hundreds of images we’ve stored in the cloud have more recently begun to arrange themselves by category and miraculously compose themselves into short videos around algorithmically curated topics. Just as image search algorithms have begun to get increasingly accurate—capable of tagging images sometimes even better than humans can. In all of this, the primary focus has been to identify the people in these images. Social media companies have long understood the advantage of accurate facial recognition—the more skilful they get at identifying friends and acquaintances within images, the better is their ability to understand the web of our social connections. By uploading a decade’s worth of personal images onto sharing websites, we have provided them ample data with which to train algorithms in facial identification. We’ve seen how these algorithms have improved over the years with the many connections that our social networks have miraculously generated for us. In the context of personal privacy, all of this is actually a cause for considerable concern. Unlike iris and fingerprint data, your face is always visible, and easily captured—often without your knowing it. Given the ever expanding network of cameras and mobile devices that surround us, facial recognition exposes us to the significant risk of active surveillance. If Google Lens is all it is cracked up to be, that risk may just have doubled as we now have in play, accurate mobile technology capable of providing workable, real-time facial recognition in still and moving images. Facial recognition is, at best, superficially regulated. We have next to no information as to how these technologies are being developed within technology companies—but we do get a glimpse of how rapidly they are advancing when we notice that the algorithms are now capable of identifying us from our baby pictures, with facial hair or under costume makeup. If we worry that the use of biometrics exposes us to persistent surveillance I would argue that facial recognition poses the greatest threat, far more than iris or fingerprints ever could. It is imperative that we understand the full extent of this risk and take steps to protect ourselves adequately. Rahul Matthan is a partner at Trilegal.

Google is adding an option to disable all network media notifications on Chromecast and Google Home devices Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 9:51am PDTMay 23, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares213 Chromecast Google Google Home News The addition of Chromecast network notifications probably seemed like a good idea at the time. They allow you to control media even if you aren't the one who started playback. However, you see those notifications on your device even if you're not watching or listening to the content, and you can end up with multiple cast notifications on a busy network. Google is finally making these notifications optional with a toggle that turns off all the network notifications for your Chromecast or Google Home. Previously, you could only disable the notifications on a per device basis. So, each person on your network had to go into their Google settings and turn off the notifications. According to Google's Chromecast support page, there's a toggle in the Google Home app that can disable the notifications for all content at the network level. Casting to the device will no longer produce a media notification for anyone on your network. Here's now you do it... or how you will eventually. Open the Google Home app. In the top right corner of the Home screen, tap Devices to see available Chromecast devices. Scroll to find the device card for the Chromecast you'd like prevent sending cast notifications. In the top right corner of the device card, tap the device card menu. Under Device info, turn "Let others control your casted media" off. Google seems to have jumped the gun a little adding this to the support page. No one on the AP team has this option in settings yet, even those of us in the preview program. Give it a few days and the toggle will probably appear.

This usually saves me when my remote isn't nearby to pause something I'm watching Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bdc26dc659652bf4327d7529629202ff2b4029b31075a2365de69c6365283112.gif Paul_Werner Aw, she looks so sad. It's OK, hopefully Google will fix it... someday. LOL Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I strangely have the exact opposite problem. If I start playing some music on my Google Home and stop it later (or it stops itself), I'll still have a streaming notification sitting on my phone hours later. Sadly because there is no other interface I'll have to leave that device enabled, but I can finally switch off my SHIELD and Chromecasts! Bartek Juszczak I've been on both sides of that. Sometimes the notification is there for hours when it shouldn't be an you can't swipe it away. Other times the notification of the app that's casting disappears for no reason and this one half saves me though not too much cause all you can do is pause. It's all just quite broken Bartek Juszczak Yeah the casting system is still a bit of a broken mess. With a Chromecast Audio I still can't say "Ok Google, play music on my chromecast", it just doesn't work with audio. With Google Play Music I still can't start playback on my computer. Apps disconnect and casting breaks all the time. Notifications get stuck. Different track name is displayed to what's playing etc. Unable to do anything but pause and play via the notification, should be able to skip tracks, change volume etc etc. Sometimes it all *barely* works.

YaKillaCJ The real issue is Google needs to fix the connection issues. Even on stable and great networks, Casting disconnect. Networks where UPnP devices wouldn't skip a beat. We really should have advanced options to refresh rates and option to disable sleep while casting for example. Also part of the issue is the lack of ability to use Casting while offline. I shouldn't have to be online for casting local content. All I'm saying is to fix the real issues and they wouldn't have to try and force annoying notifications to everyone. 4Ui812 I turned this shit off on my phone as soon as they added it. I kept shutting off other people's cast by accident thinking I was the one who started it. boop Seem like it's broken on O anyway Ryan It should have been an "opt in" feature. I cant say how many times my girlfriend would break casting before we figured this out. Bartek Juszczak It shouldn't have been. This means that if my grandparents get chromecasts/cast devices, it will be super easy for them, either of them can pause or control any chromecast at any time, it's super convenient and if it's not on by default they'll never know it exists. What it should be is a pre-selected option during the initial cast device setup "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing." Ryan "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing.", So opt in then? And odds are your grandparents were more likely to constantly just be shutting eachothers casts off like everyone else. Bartek Juszczak Opt-in as in not on by default but can be turned on? This would be preselected as on, if you just quickly skip through the setup it would be on. If you pay more attention you can untick it. Opt in would mean most people wouldn't have it, either because they skipped through setup quickly or because it's unticked by default, so if they're not familiar with it it feels safer to leave it off. And no, a lot of people do use it as intended and not to switch each other's stuff off. Though if the notification said who's casting, had next, previous and volume control buttons, it would be far more useful. YaKillaCJ I disagree. I see it as a nuisance, invasion of privacy, and lacks useful functionality. The very idea is that the device that started the casting is the remote. Not every connected device becomes a remote. I can see and understand its use case but it should definitely have been opt in. Cory S I live alone, so the most annoying thing about these notifications for me is they aren't consistent. I never know if I pull my phone out of my pocket if the damn thing will be there or not. nxtiak I wish we can ADJUST the volume. I have Google Home playing to my Chrome Audio in my kitchen, sucks that I can't adjust the volume of it using this notification. neoKushan It's not just the volume, all you can really do with the notification is pause and stop. I find this incredibly frustrating, if I've got the app installed I should be able to have full control, or at the very least next/previous - you know, basic media controls for your media notification. Cliff Robertson Oh boy. The notifications I blocked months ago will have a setting to turn it off... Shane Hull Blocked it how? trwnh Thank God. Finally. Richard Branches https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9718c51c9544e88fcd9c489ee5cca7dd7feaef70a61d54217bdbdbd76015224e.gif whispy_snippet The thing is, I actually like the feature on my home network. I'd prefer to keep it on. But what DOES annoy me is when I get two cast notifications for something I'VE cast. Has this been addressed yet?

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 102 Share on Twitter Total Shares477 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Ryan Yes, but we still have all of the money. Magister Good for them. I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future.

Last fall I had the opportunity to facilitate a design sprint for our New Mobile Experiences team to explore new ways of connecting people to the mobile web. Our team had a productive week and you can read more about our experience in this post on the Sprint Stories website. This year, Google I/O included a panel of Google “Sprint Masters” discussing how they use Design Sprints in their work: Using Design Sprints to Increase Cross-Functional Collaboration. A common theme during the discussion was the importance of detailed facilitator planning in advance of the Design Sprint. What is the most important thing to do in preparing for a Sprint? “The most important thing is planning, planning, and then more planning. I want to emphasize the fact that there are unknowns during a Design Sprint, so you have to even plan for those. And what that looks like is the agenda, how you want to pace the activities, and who you want in the room.” — Ratna Desai, Google UX Lead When I was planning my first Design Sprint as a facilitator, I was grateful for the detailed daily outlines in the GV Library, as well as the Monday morning kickoff presentation. But, given the popularity of Design Sprints, I was surprised that I was unable to find (at the time at least) examples of daily presentations that I could repurpose to keep us on track. There is a a lot to cover in a 5 day Design Sprint. It’s a challenge to even remember what is coming next, let alone keep everything timely and orderly. I relied heavily on these Keynote slides to pace our activities and I hope that they can serve as a resource for other first time Design Sprint facilitators by cutting down on some of your planning time. These slides closely follow the basic approach described in the Sprint book, but could be easily modified to suit your specific needs. They also include some presenter notes to help you describe each activity. Shout out to Unsplash for the amazing photos.

Zachary Karabell The problem is our inability to measure the digital revolution that has redefined the economy. Photo: Hindustan Times When it comes to productivity, only two things are undebatable: that the official rate of US productivity growth has stalled since 2007, having started to slow before then, and that there is no consensus about why or what to do about it. There is, additionally, some broad consensus that without stronger productivity growth going forward, standards of living will not improve appreciably, which is likely to fuel the current wave of populist discontent. One explanation, however, is increasingly popular even as it faces considerable scepticism among economists and policymakers: that the problem is less about productivity than about our inability to measure the effect of the digital and now data revolution that has redefined the American economy. In short, there is a growing chasm between what our economic system is and what our numbers are capable of measuring. Take Google. Its searches are used billions of times a day. Every single one is free. The same could be said of Google Maps or Waze, which are free for the user. While some of what they offer adds little to collective economic output (a group chat between a gaggle of teens has no immediate economic value), a considerable percentage does. That navigation app reduces time spent on the road or stuck in traffic, potentially reduces the amount of gas used, and then frees up that time and savings for other, possible more productive uses. Several years ago, Erik Brynjolfsson, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist, tried to measure what these “free goods of the Internet” might be adding to gross domestic product (GDP). The methods were innovative, trying to gauge what value people assign to their time and then multiplying that by time spent using Google and similar services. He estimated that as of 2012, such “free goods” might add $300 billion to gross domestic product, increasing at the rate of $40 billion a year, which would mean close to $500 billion in 2017. These were only halting initial steps in what is surely a complicated and as yet unresolved process to factor the innovations of the past decade and more into calculations of economic output and activity. In early May, the US Bureau of Economic Analysis released a paper concluding that its own measures of inflation and GDP had been unable to keep up with the changes in the economy, and hence had been off by as much as half a per cent a year. These issues are not new, but they remain unresolved. The lessons of the Federal Reserve in the 1990s are instructive. The US economy was booming, new technologies were proliferating, and yet productivity numbers were anaemic. Then governor Alan Greenspan tasked the team of economists at the Fed to investigate. Building on the 1989 observation of Robert Solow that “computers were everywhere but in the productivity statistics”, the Fed began to assess how productivity was calculated and understood. That led to more emphasis on different formulas such as multi-factor productivity, which went beyond looking just at labour and capital investment; they also took a longer view that new innovations can take years to show up in official statistics. Measured productivity did begin to accelerate in the mid-1990s, along with greater attention by policymakers to different formulas such as multi-factor productivity to measure it. That said, the debates today haven’t altered much, with a few voices suggesting that we fail to account for the “consumer surplus” or adequately account for the gains from the digital revolution, while many others, such as Robert Gordon, contend that the productivity slowdown is a result of a mature economy that is not keeping pace with societal needs. For them, the statistics, even if slightly outmoded, reflect an unarguable reality whose economic and social consequences are evident. Even those who acknowledge underestimation of productivity tend to argue that if you added back some amount for the hard-to-quantify effects of the digital revolution, you still wouldn’t get back to the levels of the 20th century. Perhaps. Or perhaps the mismeasurement debated is only a portion of just how significant these mismeasurements are. Even more, perhaps the entire framework is now flawed. The hard numbers today are failing to account for certain observable contradictions—such as how there can be high levels of employment combined with very little wage growth and extremely low inflation. If various free or inexpensive digital solutions are generating adequate output without adding much in the way of labour costs or capital spending, then that would explain why labour costs and capital investment are low. And if those solutions are also leading to less expensive goods and services, that would in part explain why measured productivity is weak. All this suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to the real possibility that productivity isn’t slowing the way we think, or that slower measured productivity isn’t having the same consequences as when the economy was primarily based on making physical goods. Perhaps if we emphasized quantity and quality rather than market price, the optics would be different. Governments seem unwilling to allocate resources to developing a system for better accounting for free services and how the deflationary effects of technology can both improve standards of living and lower GDP. But if we are going to understand the causes of inequality and formulate solutions, we need to start with data we can count on.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Aims To Connect Online Ads to Real-World Sales By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MAY 23 2017 Google already monitors your online shopping -- but now it's also keeping an eye on what you're buying in physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. Google's computers will be trying to connect the dots between what people look at after clicking on an online ad and what they purchase with their credit and debit cards at one of the advertiser's brick-and-mortar stores. For instance, if someone searching for a pair of running shoes online clicked on an ad from a sporting goods store but didn't buy anything, an advertiser might initially conclude that the ad was a waste of money. With the new tool, Google says it will now be able to tell if the same person bought the shoes a few days later at a physical store. Mining Credit Card Data Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By scanning this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. But it could also deepen worries among privacy watchdogs, who are already concerned about the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Google's Opportunity The Mountain View, California, company already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. Google unveiled the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting is an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn't prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. Smarter Tracking Google is also introducing new ways to help merchants drive more traffic to their physical stores, such as by displaying locations of nearby stores when watching ads on YouTube, something Google already does for non-video ads. Other tools are aimed at giving merchants a better understanding on how digital ads appearing across a variety of devices are affecting their sales. Most of these new analytics draw upon Google's inroads in "machine learning" -- a way of "training" computers to behave more like humans -- to interpret the data. Google's search engine and Chrome web browser are a rich source of data about people's interests and online activities that it can feed into machine-learning systems. Just last week, Google unveiled new ways that machine learning can help people identify flowers or pull up restaurant reviews just by pointing a camera. Now, Google is showing how it plans to use machine learning to make more money. Digital Dossiers Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers can collect identifying data triggered by online clicks and match it with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when a digital ad contributes to an offline purchase. Google's tool won't work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. Shoppers remain anonymous, meaning they aren't identified by their names, according to Google. And the company says it doesn't share any of its anonymized information with its customers; instead, it targets ads at individuals who fit demographic profiles sought by advertisers. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown -- although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Google brings expanded AMP support to search and display ads Posted 12 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Uber says it accidentally underpaid drivers in New York City When Google launched its Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project about a year and a half ago, the focus was squarely on speeding up mobile web pages, with a special emphasis on news sites. Over the last few months, both the scope of supported pages and the range of places where Google surfaces AMP pages increased. Now, the company is taking the next step by using the technologies it developed for AMP to also speed up some of its core money-making services. At an event in San Francisco, Google today announced that AdWords users will now be able to use AMP pages as the landing pages for their ads. In addition, Google said that it is now automatically converting Google Display Network ads into the AMP Ads format when they load on AMP pages to speed up their loading time, too. This feature is now available in beta. AMP landing pages obviously load significantly faster than standard mobile web pages — typically in less than a second. And the faster those pages load, the higher the chance of converting a user into a customer. Google tested this feature with brands like Johnson & Johnson, eBay and real estate company Toll Brothers. “Johnson & Johnson has seen great results in testing AMP with our product information pages. For specific pages, we’ve seen page speeds improve by 10x and engagement rates improve by 20%,” Paul Ortmayer, Head of Digital Analytics – EMEA for Johnson & Johnson said in today’s announcement. “J&J is looking forward to expanding our application of AMP.” As for AMP Ads, Google says that they will load up to 5 seconds faster than regular ads, even though they will look exactly the same. Google argues that this ensures that users will actually see these ads and “that the experiences users have with your brand is seamless.” Earlier this month, at its I/O developer conference, Google announced that its newly optimized Google AMP Cache, together with a number of other speed-ups, allows AMP pages to load almost twice as fast from Google Search than before. The company also used the event to launch enhanced analytics support for AMP. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

clock menu more-arrow How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game by Nick Statt@nickstatt May 22, 2017, 10:19am EDT Illustrations by William Joel Photography by James Bareham share tweet Linkedin Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. There were just a few problems: Yang knew nothing about starting a company, building consumer electronics, or selling products. “I was a software engineer all my life at Google. I didn’t know anyone in the electronics manufacturing world,” Yang tells me over Skype from his office in Shenzhen, China. But he started the company regardless, thanks in no small part to his previous experience with Amazon’s sellers marketplace, a platform for third-party companies and tiny one- or two-person teams interested in selling directly to consumers. He named the company Anker, after the German word for ship anchor. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave Anker has since become the most popular brand of portable battery packs on Amazon. Portable chargers had a bit of a standout moment last summer, when players of the wildly popular and battery-hogging Pokémon Go could be seen roaming the streets, their phones constantly plugged in. But these accessories have existed for years as a remedy for our battery woes since the standard smartphone tends to last no more than a day on a single charge. So in airports, the back of cabs, and on city streets we’re plugging into lithium-ion slabs in our pockets and bags to stay connected. The market for portable battery packs generated $360 million in the 12 months ending in March 2017 in the US alone. The brands behind these packs are largely anonymous — Kmashi, Jackery, and iMuto — and they often stay that way. Except Anker. The steady rise of the company’s profile is proof that it’s possible to meet one very specific consumer need and ride that wave as it continues to ripple out to other markets. A majority of Anker’s sales come from cables and wall chargers, and it’s now moving into the smart home and auto market — anywhere a plug and a cable can solve a problem. Yang and his team started a company with the sole purpose of selling a better third-party accessory. But they stumbled onto a more lucrative reality: mobile phones, once niche luxury items, are now ubiquitous centerpieces of our digital lives. Each of these phones, and all the products that connect to them, need their own cable and plug. And each and every day these devices die before we want them to. PowerCore 10000. If there’s anything you should know about smartphone development over the last 10 years, it’s this: batteries are not lasting longer. Phones may be thinner and faster, with larger screens and better cameras, but they don’t stay powered for longer than a day, perhaps 36 hours at best. The culprit is the fundamental science of lithium-ion batteries, which are tremendous at storing energy but only within limited size and capacity constraints. The lithium-ion batteries we have today operate at about a fifth of their potential storage capacity, says Lynden Archer, a professor of chemical engineering at Cornell University. And yet that’s still at about 90 percent of the maximum potential today’s battery science allows. “A breakthrough would require a new paradigm,” he says. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough.” That stagnation has allowed Anker to flourish. “A huge part of Anker’s success is the fact that our batteries don’t last long enough,” says Joanna Stern, a technology columnist and gadget reviewer for The Wall Street Journal. “They saw that accessories needed to be made to address customers’ pain points. They’re making the chargers, the cases, the cords — and they’re making it for affordable prices so you can have one of these in every place you are.” Mobile battery packs weren’t the company’s initial goal. In the late 2000s, Yang identified a consumer need not being met: well-built, reliable laptop battery replacements. “You have a Dell or HP laptop — let’s assume you got it in 2009 — and in 2011 the battery is dying and you want to get a new one,” he says. Back then you had two choices: buy directly from Dell or HP, with a high price tag, or buy a white-label battery that’s cheap but poorly made. “Which one do I want to buy?” asks Yang. “The answer is neither of them.” Yang saw a desire for a better type of accessory — one that wouldn’t cost as much as a replacement straight from the original manufacturer, but that would be of a high enough quality to earn consumers’ trust. Before he could sell that product, he needed to figure out how to make it. It was a long and painful process. After he quit his job at Google in July 2011, Anker took 12 months just to prototype its first laptop battery. That was even after Yang and the core team moved to Shenzhen to find reliable manufacturing partners. “I knew that if I stayed in California and had people FedEx me prototypes in a week, it was just not going to work,” he says. Many hardware companies, especially crowdfunded ones in the US, learn that lesson the hard way, missing deadlines and hitting snags that lead to months-long delays. A solid supply chain is so crucial to a hardware company’s survival that there’s an entire consulting industry around helping startups find suppliers and set expectations. Critical to avoiding these pitfalls was Dongpong Zhao, Google’s then-head of sales in China. Zhao joined Anker in early 2012, and helped Yang build out the company’s supply chain. Anker was made up of around ten people at the time. “Think of it as a small family business instead of like an actual company,” Yang says. The company tirelessly built out a supply chain in its first year and began testing its first products — the laptop chargers and batteries it would begin selling direct to consumers on Amazon. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity. That got us quite the reputation.” From there, Anker ventured into smartphone batteries with a replacement unit for the HTC Sensation. “We were able to make cellphone battery cells that actually had slightly better capacity,” Yang says. “That got us quite the reputation.” Early on, Anker developed close relationships with suppliers in Asia, including Panasonic and anode supplier BTR, to help test and quickly develop new batteries. Yang says he and Anker’s small team “definitely saw the explosion of smart devices” as its biggest and most obvious opportunity, and Anker started aggressively expanding into portable battery packs, wall chargers, and cables. By the end of 2012, after shifting more resources toward portable chargers, Yang says Anker went from selling 100 to 1,000 products per day. “The challenge wasn’t selling products,” Yang says. “It was making products and making sure they were high-quality as well. That’s why we spent a majority of our effort on R&D and product development.” The company does a majority of its sales directly to consumers over Amazon Marketplace, where a combination of strong reviews, low prices, and prominent placement in search rankings can turn a single product into a lucrative line. For the accessories market, which tends to piggyback off trends in mainstream consumer electronics, a true breakthrough is rare. But Anker found one in charging, based on the realization that while batteries may not be improving, charging time certainly was. According a study conducted last year by PhoneArena, it took more than two hours on average to charge a device to 100 percent in 2013. Today, it can be done in almost half the time. So Anker set out to make the fastest chargers available. Take the PowerPort 5, a matte black rectangle no larger than a deck of playing cards, with five USB ports. When it was first introduced in 2015, it was the only accessory on the market capable of charging five devices simultaneously at optimal speed. Or the company’s standard PowerCore portable charger, roughly the size of a credit card and just under one inch thick — a white block encasing 10,000mAh of lithium-ion battery cells. It has four pinholes that light up in LED blue when you press an elliptical button on the top to check its remaining charge. It can refill a depleted iPhone 7 in just over 60 minutes nearly four times over before it needs to be recharged. Most Anker charging products have one signature: the PowerIQ logo. Launched in 2013, the company’s proprietary charging standard is now present on nearly all of its batteries and wall plugs. The technology, carried by a small chip inside each charger, identifies whatever device is being plugged in, be it an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, or an iPad Pro 9.7-inch, in order to detect and deliver the maximum current the product allows. Anker says the technology can shave hours off the amount of time it takes to reach a full charge. A next-generation version of the chip, a sequel to PowerIQ, is slated to start shipping in new Anker charging products later this year, allowing for smaller and lighter accessories. On top of its products’ technical advantages, Anker banks on looks to make its chargers stand out. Brand manager Elisa Lu says every device’s packaging is carefully thought out from the moment customers receive the product, to when they open it and use it. Devices come in a white-and-light-blue box with the name Anker printed in all caps across the front. Inside is a meticulously packaged arrangement of lightweight cardboard. Anker products carry that new gadget smell — a blend of peculiar odors from the evaporation of chemical compounds in the plastics and the epoxy coatings of the device. Beside its red cables, which Anker offers in both standard and braided nylon versions, and a single one-off red battery pack, the company sells products in only two color options: black and white. All this has a strategic business purpose. “When our consumers receive our products, we want to make sure they know they are getting it from a reliable and trustworthy company,” Lu says. Brand trust is a pivotal consideration when purchasing what may seem like random electronics off Amazon. Inside the the box with Anker’s larger products, you’ll also find a small square piece of paper with two questions: are you happy, or are you unhappy? If you’re unhappy, a block of text instructs you to contact Anker customer support via phone, email, or on its website. If you’re satisfied, it asks you to tell your friends or family. Better yet, leave an Amazon review. PowerCore Slim 5000. In many ways, Anker’s success is born from the failures of premier manufacturers like Apple and Samsung. Where those companies introduce points of friction — like ever-thinner devices with short battery lives — Anker offers a remedy. “My feeling is that Anker is a success because Apple offers such subpar and expensive accessories,” says Stern, who’s often recommended Anker products in her WSJ column. It may be surprising that Apple sat idly as the accessory market ballooned around it; it took the company years to develop its own battery case for the iPhone to compete with Mophie. But Apple has always favored high margins on premium products, even the cables and earbuds it sells in the Apple Store. This has given ample room to companies like Anker, with the low overhead of an e-commerce business, to sell similar products of near-identical quality for $10 to $20 cheaper. And where Apple and others failed to develop products of their own like multi-port wall plugs and portable chargers, Anker saw the opportunity and capitalized on it. The company is quick to fill gaps created by smartphone manufacturers. When Apple removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, for instance, Anker saw a giant opportunity to begin producing new dongles and other cable adapters to help consumers adjust. But mastering Amazon was the real key to securing Anker’s future. Search for a generic accessory like “cellphone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results If you head over to Amazon.com right now and peruse the retailer’s most popular smartphone accessories and you’ll find Anker products at the top. Search for a generic accessory like “cellphone wall charger” or “Lightning cable” and you’ll find the Anker brand high up in the search results, typically with a 4.5 or 5-star rating. In fact, Anker products take up the first five slots on Amazon’s list of best-selling portable batteries. And alongside the ratings, you’ll find thousands of customer reviews — reviews that the company scans meticulously for ideas on how to improve their development process. Two years before he left Google, Yang became intimately familiar with Amazon’s Marketplace when he built an automated system for a friend who was selling third-party products on Amazon as a side business. It essentially took care of aspects of the business like inventory, logistics and fulfillment, and sales tracking. “It took me two months, evenings and weekends, to develop this system,” Yang explained in a video produced by Amazon last year to promote entrepreneurship on its platform. “Within a month, she was fulfilling 300 orders a day.” Building this system gave Yang invaluable insight into how third-party selling on Amazon functioned. He discovered what worked and what didn’t, and how entire brands could crop up overnight and fade into obscurity the next day. Anker thrived by borrowing infrastructure from Amazon and relying on engineering and support in China. “Amazon provides loads of services — financial services, fulfillment. It actually makes selling a low-barrier thing,” Yang says. Although the company attempted to handle its own fulfillment in its early days, it eventually discovered it could not compete with what Amazon offered. Now, about 95 percent of Anker’s products are listed as “Fulfilled by Amazon.” You can build an online retail business off Amazon, but making sure your products get exposure is the hard part. “The biggest challenge for Anker is not sales. It’s customer perception,” Yang says. “People think they need [Apple’s] cube charger and stock cable.” Teaching people that there is a superior product out there, and then convincing them to keep buying, is Anker’s core challenge. “Amazon reviews were really enormously helpful,” Yang says. “The Amazon reviews just come and come automatically.” PowerLine+ USB-C to USB 3.0. Silicon Valley is full of breathless mission statements designed to inspire and justify the power and influence of technology, like Apple’s famous “think different” slogan, and Google’s ominous and now defunct “don’t be evil” mantra. Facebook, back in 2012, celebrated its billion-user milestone with an ad comparing the social network to chairs, bridges, and even nations. Anker has never aspired to such grand ambitions. “At Anker, we can't exactly help you unwind,” the company admits on its Amazon sellers page. Instead, Anker takes a more straightforward approach by solving the inevitable problems technology creates. “Say goodbye to first-world tech woes like oppressive low batteries and limited ports,” the page says. “Say hello to an easier, smarter life.” Yang is trying to extend this simple philosophy to categories like headphones, speakers, phone cases, and now smart home appliances under a new brand called Eufy. Launched last September, Eufy is Anker’s avenue for selling things like Roomba clones, desk lamps, and bathroom scales. Expanding into more product categories is a logical evolution for Anker, but it’s also a response to a looming existential threat: Yang says he foresees a future where portable chargers won’t be necessary due to advancements in both fast charging and wireless charging. “I think we all agree that the portable charger isn’t forever,” Yang says. But consumers will always need wall plugs and cables, and Anker sees its goal now as keeping pace with changing standards, like the introduction of USB-C. PowerCore 5000. In the meantime, Yang says it’s diversifying with a future expansion into audio, smart home, and automotive product lines. Anker already produces Bluetooth headphones and speakers, but it has aspirations to compete with the likes of Harman Kardon and Bose. Key to the success of those products is moving to brick-and-mortar retailers. Terrence Wang, the company’s chief marketing officer hired from Procter & Gamble in 2015, says having a presence in Best Buy and Walmart, a process that began last year, is the next stage of Anker’s evolution. “Expanding from online to offline is critical actually,” Wang says. “We are trying to get as many people to know that they have a simple, convenient, portable, fast solution rather than just have to bring their own charger wherever they go. That’s the original brand vision.” The company’s focus on storefront retail is a response to a second very real threat — dependence on a direct-to-consumer, online-only model. The company has found it difficult these days to launch new products on Amazon. Older products have thousands of reviews, while newer ones need to earn placement in the search rankings and collect testimonials before more cautious buyers pull the trigger. “We’re seeing a bit of a dilemma on that one,” Yang says. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices.” The company is also struggling with its complex product line, with a dizzying number of choices that may alienate consumers who are looking for a simple choice. “We’re converging to this generation approach,” Yang says. “So we’ll try to release a generation of products every 18 to 24 months.” Choosing which products to promote at Best Buy, which to discontinue, and where to put resources for the future are all part of Anker’s growing pains. The company’s success hinges on convincing — or “educating” — their consumers about the value of what they’re offering. Yang likes to tell a story about a moment he sees play out on repeat every single time he’s at an airport, anywhere on the planet. He sees people, smartphones in hand, rushing from outlet to outlet, looking for space with “the little Apple cube in their hands” and running out of options. “To a lot of people, the original charger and the original cable are the only means to charge their devices, in their mind,” he says. “I look at those people and I always want to go up to them and talk to them.” Instead, Yang and the Anker team started conducting an annual consumer survey. It has only one question: how often does your smartphone run out of battery? Once every day? Once a week? Once a month? Or perhaps never? “Forty percent of people say their battery ran out at least once last week, another 40 percent say at least once last month,” Yang says. “As long as these numbers don’t go down, I think we have a lot of work to do.” Good Deals Amazon Echo Dot flash deal: $10 off, today only Apple Apple reportedly plans to perform 5G internet tests in Cupertino Circuit Breaker Prynt made another printer that turns photos into AR video experiences View all stories in Tech Loading comments...

By CaitlinHuston Reporter One of Alphabet’s “other bets,” a category that has yet to add much to Google’s parent company, could be worth $70 billion. Now that Waymo, Alphabet’s GOOG, +0.74% GOOGL, +0.67%  self-driving car unit, has partnered with ride-hailing service Lyft, Morgan Stanley analysts see a path forward for monetization and the potential to spin off the segment into a separate company. As self-driving cars free up drivers, they also see the potential for Google’s advertising services to monetize the riders as they browse the internet. The analysts calculated the enterprise value based on the assumption that Waymo cars will be used in about 1% of all global miles driven by 2030. This number is based off a fleet of three million cars that each drive about 65,000 miles a year. If the self-driving cars charged about $1.25 per mile in a ride-hailing program like Lyft’s, it would lead to a $70 billion valuation that would add about 12% to Alphabet’s overall enterprise value, the analysts contend. Experts have said Waymo’s technology is among the best in the self-driving field, but that it has been held back by a lack of commercialization and overshadowed by Tesla Inc. TSLA, -2.09%  , which has been able to log more test miles through its fleet of cars driven by owners. With the Lyft partnership, Morgan Stanley analysts—including Adam Jonas, known for his bullish views of Tesla—see Waymo emerging as more of a competitor. Don’t miss: Want to invest in self-driving cars? Check out the chips Still, the analysts do not expect Waymo to generate a positive operating profit until 2022 and expect Waymo to continue to invest in the technology, which could weigh on margins. The analysts currently value the overall “other bets” segment, which includes Nest, a provider of smart home products, internet provider Fiber and Verily, a life-sciences unit, at negative $21 billion. Alphabet’s “other bets” segment contributed $244 million in revenue in the first-quarter of 2017, up from $165 million in the year-earlier period. It posted a wider operating loss of $855 million, however, compared with $774 million in the year-earlier period. Waymo is also locked in a lawsuit with Uber Technologies Inc., a competitor of Lyft, over self-driving technology Waymo purports was stolen by a former employee and brought to Uber. See also: The tech behind Google-Uber legal beef could be ready to boom While Waymo’s strong business case could lead to a spinoff of the company, the spinoff may also be a regulatory necessity for Alphabet, as the analysts surmise that the company may not want to be the first to test the U.S. court system as questions about the cars’ safety arise. “We see Waymo facing material regulatory and (likely) legal risk as it continues to drive the autonomous vehicle transition that parent-company Alphabet may not necessarily wish to be directly exposed to,” Nowak wrote. The self-driving cars may free up a new segment of consumers for Alphabet, as the analysts foresee passengers browsing the web, watching videos and shopping. This could be an advertising opportunity, with the ads targeting consumers based on location. Read: Why the father of self-driving cars left Google “Drivers’ time previously spent driving is now available for consumption and monetization,” said Brian Nowak, lead analyst on the note. Shares of Alphabet have gained 14% in the past three months, compared with the S&P 500’s index’s SPX, +0.18% gain of 1.5%.

The program beat Ke in the first of three planned matches. Peng Peng/AP In the first of three matches with the world's No. 1 Go player, a Google artificial intelligence program claimed victory Tuesday. It won the round by just a fraction of a point in Wuzhen, China, but the win was enough to leave its grandmaster opponent impressed and thoroughly confounded by the result. Last year, after Google's AlphaGo dispatched human grandmaster Lee Sedol in the notoriously complex board game for the first time, 19-year-old Ke Jie expressed confidence that he wouldn't share the same fate, according to The New York Times. After all, Ke had defeated Lee several times himself. The Two-Way Going, Going, Gone: Master Go Player Loses Best-Of-5 Match With A.I. By the match's end Tuesday, Ke felt markedly different about his nonhuman competitor. "Last year, it was still quite humanlike when it played," Ke said. "But this year, it became like a god of Go." YouTube His statement feels rather apt considering that, like a god, AlphaGo is its own greatest instructor. Last year, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel broke down the basics of the program developed by Google's DeepMind lab: "It started by studying a database of about 100,000 human matches, and then continued by playing against itself millions of times. "As it went, it reprogrammed itself and improved. This type of self-learning program is known as a neural network, and it's based on theories of how the human brain works. "AlphaGo consists of two neural networks: The first tries to figure out the best move to play each turn, and the second evaluates who is winning the match overall." DeepMind has further developed the architecture of the program since it defeated Lee last year. The Two-Way How Google's Neural Network Hopes To Beat A 'Go' World Champion Also like a god, AlphaGo has been demonstrating its influence far and wide among the game's top players — including Ke, who Wired notes adopted some tactics from AlphaGo. The program played many of the world's top players under the pseudonym "Master" in online matches earlier this year, according to the magazine, and its unorthodox playing style affected Ke's. In a blog post last year, DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis explained what attracted his lab to the ancient game of Go, which has been around since at least the days of Confucius: "[A]s simple as the rules are, Go is a game of profound complexity. There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible positions — that's more than the number of atoms in the universe, and more than a googol times larger than chess." It doesn't hurt that the game originated — and remains very popular — in China, with which Google has a fraught relationship. Roughly seven years ago, the California-based tech giant pulled out of the country, citing discomfort with Chinese censorship requirements. Although Reuters reports that Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet, watched the match in person in China, The Times notes that "there was no obvious live video of the event" available to viewers on the Chinese mainland. Chinese officials don't allow access to Google-owned YouTube, where the match was livestreamed, or to Google search. Yet Google continues to have designs on the massive Chinese market, announcing recently that it intends to bring some of its products back to China, according to Reuters. For now, though, skittish onlookers watching the next two matches between Ke and AlphaGo on Thursday and Saturday might do well to remember Geoff's reassurance: "This program will not lead to a dystopian future in which humanity is enslaved by killer robots. "At least not for a few more years." artificial intelligence China Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

(NASDAQ: FB) and Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google. That’s hardly news. What may be news is that users tend to seek information on different topics from the two web giants. People searching for lifestyle news are about 12 times more likely to use Facebook than Google to find what they’re looking for. Those searching for business and financial news are better than three times more likely to find what they’re seeking using Google Search. The data were reported recently by data analytics firm Parse.ly. The firm scanned more than 10 million articles published on its network in 2016 to determine the referral percentages from identifiable, external sources. On the topic of “world economy,” for example, 43% of the referrals to some 26,000 posts came from Google Search and 36% from Facebook. The most common words in the posts were “China” and “oil.” Google News (news.google.com) got another 4.6% and Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) got 4%. On the topic of “presidential politics,” 59.5% of referrals to 110,000 posts came from Facebook and 24.6% came from Google Search. Google News took 4.3% and Twitter 4.1% of the referrals on this topic. The most common words were “Trump” and “Clinton.” The “sports” topic drew 50.4% of its referrals from Google Search and 19.2% from Facebook. Twitter performed third-best on this topic, with 10.6% of referrals to a total of 210,000 posts. When the topic turns to “technology,” people turn to Google Search by a margin of 60.8% to 21.3% for Facebook. The top words in this category were “university” and “car.” The full report with charts and a detailed methodology is available at the Parse.ly website.

Google is adding an option to disable all network media notifications on Chromecast and Google Home devices Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 9:51am PDTMay 23, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares213 Chromecast Google Google Home News The addition of Chromecast network notifications probably seemed like a good idea at the time. They allow you to control media even if you aren't the one who started playback. However, you see those notifications on your device even if you're not watching or listening to the content, and you can end up with multiple cast notifications on a busy network. Google is finally making these notifications optional with a toggle that turns off all the network notifications for your Chromecast or Google Home. Previously, you could only disable the notifications on a per device basis. So, each person on your network had to go into their Google settings and turn off the notifications. According to Google's Chromecast support page, there's a toggle in the Google Home app that can disable the notifications for all content at the network level. Casting to the device will no longer produce a media notification for anyone on your network. Here's now you do it... or how you will eventually. Open the Google Home app. In the top right corner of the Home screen, tap Devices to see available Chromecast devices. Scroll to find the device card for the Chromecast you'd like prevent sending cast notifications. In the top right corner of the device card, tap the device card menu. Under Device info, turn "Let others control your casted media" off. Google seems to have jumped the gun a little adding this to the support page. No one on the AP team has this option in settings yet, even those of us in the preview program. Give it a few days and the toggle will probably appear.

It's OK, hopefully Google will fix it... someday. LOL Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I strangely have the exact opposite problem. If I start playing some music on my Google Home and stop it later (or it stops itself), I'll still have a streaming notification sitting on my phone hours later. Sadly because there is no other interface I'll have to leave that device enabled, but I can finally switch off my SHIELD and Chromecasts! Bartek Juszczak I've been on both sides of that. Sometimes the notification is there for hours when it shouldn't be an you can't swipe it away. Other times the notification of the app that's casting disappears for no reason and this one half saves me though not too much cause all you can do is pause. It's all just quite broken Bartek Juszczak Yeah the casting system is still a bit of a broken mess. With a Chromecast Audio I still can't say "Ok Google, play music on my chromecast", it just doesn't work with audio. With Google Play Music I still can't start playback on my computer. Apps disconnect and casting breaks all the time. Notifications get stuck. Different track name is displayed to what's playing etc. Unable to do anything but pause and play via the notification, should be able to skip tracks, change volume etc etc. Sometimes it all *barely* works.

YaKillaCJ The real issue is Google needs to fix the connection issues. Even on stable and great networks, Casting disconnect. Networks where UPnP devices wouldn't skip a beat. We really should have advanced options to refresh rates and option to disable sleep while casting for example. Also part of the issue is the lack of ability to use Casting while offline. I shouldn't have to be online for casting local content. All I'm saying is to fix the real issues and they wouldn't have to try and force annoying notifications to everyone. 4Ui812 I turned this shit off on my phone as soon as they added it. I kept shutting off other people's cast by accident thinking I was the one who started it. boop Seem like it's broken on O anyway Ryan It should have been an "opt in" feature. I cant say how many times my girlfriend would break casting before we figured this out. Bartek Juszczak It shouldn't have been. This means that if my grandparents get chromecasts/cast devices, it will be super easy for them, either of them can pause or control any chromecast at any time, it's super convenient and if it's not on by default they'll never know it exists. What it should be is a pre-selected option during the initial cast device setup "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing." Ryan "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing.", So opt in then? And odds are your grandparents were more likely to constantly just be shutting eachothers casts off like everyone else. Bartek Juszczak Opt-in as in not on by default but can be turned on? This would be preselected as on, if you just quickly skip through the setup it would be on. If you pay more attention you can untick it. Opt in would mean most people wouldn't have it, either because they skipped through setup quickly or because it's unticked by default, so if they're not familiar with it it feels safer to leave it off. And no, a lot of people do use it as intended and not to switch each other's stuff off. Though if the notification said who's casting, had next, previous and volume control buttons, it would be far more useful. YaKillaCJ I disagree. I see it as a nuisance, invasion of privacy, and lacks useful functionality. The very idea is that the device that started the casting is the remote. Not every connected device becomes a remote. I can see and understand its use case but it should definitely have been opt in. Cory S I live alone, so the most annoying thing about these notifications for me is they aren't consistent. I never know if I pull my phone out of my pocket if the damn thing will be there or not. nxtiak I wish we can ADJUST the volume. I have Google Home playing to my Chrome Audio in my kitchen, sucks that I can't adjust the volume of it using this notification. neoKushan It's not just the volume, all you can really do with the notification is pause and stop. I find this incredibly frustrating, if I've got the app installed I should be able to have full control, or at the very least next/previous - you know, basic media controls for your media notification. Cliff Robertson Oh boy. The notifications I blocked months ago will have a setting to turn it off... Shane Hull Blocked it how? trwnh Thank God. Finally.

I'd prefer to keep it on. But what DOES annoy me is when I get two cast notifications for something I'VE cast. Has this been addressed yet?

Taking into account early customer feedback, the 55-inch display is available now in the U.S. starting at $4,999. Nintendo Switch Google foresees users sketching, conducting video calls over Hangouts, and collaborating with the Jamboard. Android and iOS apps allows remote users to annotate and participate from afar. There are a number of smart features, including translating scribbles to text and shapes, as well as deep integration with G Suite. The latter allows users to add images and files from Google Drive to the Jamboard, with all work also being automatically backed up. As part of today’s launch, Google is sharing some specs, including the Nvidia Jetson TX1 embedded computer that powers the 55-inch 4K display with a 120Hz touch refresh rate. The display supports 16 simultaneous touch points, while input is precise up to 1mm. Other specs include 802.11ac Wi-Fi, NFC, and Google Cast. There is an HDMI 2.0 port, USB Type C, 2 x USB 3.0 ports, and Gigabit Ethernet. Available in cobalt blue, carmine red and graphite grey, the $4,999 package also includes two styluses, an eraser, and a wall mount, with the rolling stand being an optional accessory. In addition to requiring a G Suite plan, Jamboard also features an annual management and support fee. Jamboard is available in the U.S. starting today, with a rollout to Canada and the U.K. over the summer. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Today, the company is introducing a “Family Group” feature to easily share calendars, photos, notes, and content subscriptions. Nintendo Switch A family group supports up to six people, with the person designated as the “manager” being able to create/manage accounts for those under 13, set payment methods, and decide what Google services family members have access to. Meanwhile, “parent” accounts can approve Play purchase requests and change other content restriction settings. Services include Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plan, and YouTube TV. In the case of the latter two, family groups help manage and simplify the invitation process. Meanwhile when enrolled in Google Photos, users will see a new family group option in the sharing menu that allows for easy sending of photos and videos to members. Family functionality in Calendar and Keep are similar with shared events, reminders, lists, and other notes. Family features for Google Calendar, Keep, and Photos are rolling out starting today in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

Nintendo Switch In 2014, the city of Huntsville set out to build a municipal fiber network. Built by Huntsville Utilities, Google Fiber is the city’s first tenant and will lease part of the network with a non-exclusive arrangement allowing other providers to also rent fiber from the city. This approach is cheaper and less time consuming than having to plan and lay down fiber cables into the ground. However, in its blog post, Google gives a nod to its current efforts to build out a network in Kansas City, Austin, and Nashville. As of this morning, sign-ups went live in North Huntsville for residents and small business owners. Internet plans start at $50 per month for 100 Mbps upload/download speed, while TV options start at $140. Upgrading to gigabit internet costs $20 on both plans, with users also able to add a Fiber Phone service. These plans are identically priced with the most recent launch in Raleigh, North Carolina. While Fiber has paused deployment in new cities, Google appears to still be committed to its existing ones. Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

Ian Hodson, who was the head of Google’s text to speech program, has joined Dublin and Boston-based Voysis, a start-up that recently raised €8m from Polaris Ventures to develop its own voice recognition technology. Mr Hodson was responsible for voice in Google Maps, Google Assistant and Android and has a sterling reputation within the IT industry. Voysis are aiming to build on the capability of their voice recognition and artificial intelligence (AI) product to be used in eCommerce, self-driving vehicles and computing. By hiring Mr Hodson and other industry heavyweights, Voysis founder and CEO Peter Cahill said he believed it could provide strong competition to Amazon and Google. Mr Hodson, who for the last five years led Google’s global text-to-speech efforts, has joined the company in the role of "distinguished architect". Ian Hodson. With more than 20 years of voice industry experience, Mr Hodson is expected to play a leading role across product, strategy and R&D. “Ian is renowned for his domain knowledge and mentoring skills and is regarded by many leading scientists and engineers in this space as the very best at what he does. Ian's breadth of in-domain experience at companies both small and large will no doubt have an impact on all aspects of the company,” said Mr Cahill. Mr Hodson said he was “thrilled” with the new challenge. “Given my career to date, I have a deep appreciation and respect for the magnitude of the challenges that companies across all industries face in a voice-first world. I joined the Voysis team because of the company's impressive understanding of these challenges and its platform approach, which uniquely positions them to deliver. I am thrilled to join the team and be a part of making voice AI accessible to companies across all verticals,” he said. Executive chairman Noel Ruane said Mr Hodson’s hire was “a great early milestone for the business” that had led to Voysis “already becoming known as a go-to destination for the top talent” coming out of leading European universities.

Three big technological changes — autonomy, electric power, and ride-hailing — are about to hit the car industry. The big question is whether these changes pose an existential threat to incumbent car companies, or whether they can muddle through with modest changes to their core car manufacturing business. On the surface, picking a new CEO who comes from Ford’s advanced technology group might seem like a sign that Ford was taking the dangers of disruption seriously. “This transition here is totally out of character for them,” says industry analyst Edward Niedermeyer, who adds that leadership changes at the company are normally carefully planned. “Clearly there was some need for some symbolism in terms of emphasizing how important these future technologies are to the business,” according to Niedermeyer. But when you dig into the details, it doesn’t seem like Ford is actually doing much to change its strategy. For example, the company’s press release announcing Hackett’s selection says, rather blandly, that it will help Ford “further strengthen its core automotive business and accelerate a strategic shift to capitalize on emerging opportunities.” That’s not exactly a call to arms. If Ford wanted to focus more on emerging technologies, it might have chosen someone with a technology background. That’s not Hackett. He made his reputation as the CEO of the furniture maker Steelcase. And in the Monday morning press conference following the announcement, Hackett was cagey about whether Ford was still committed to his predecessor’s oft-stated goal to have a fully self-driving car on the road — one with no steering wheel and no pedals — by 2021. In short, if Ford has a plan to redouble its investments in new technologies, there was little sign of it in Monday’s announcement. Indeed, one industry analyst I spoke to argued that Ford should move in the opposite direction, focusing on fine-tuning its lucrative pickup truck business. That would likely bolster Ford’s profits in the short run, but it could leave Ford flat-footed if rivals widen their lead on autonomy, ride-hailing, and electric vehicles. Autonomy could pose an existential threat to Ford Instagram before the internet. Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Over the past two decades, we’ve seen example after example of technology companies entering new industries with devastating effect. Digital cameras drove Kodak into bankruptcy. Record labels saw their revenue plunge after the emergence of file-sharing and the invention of the iPod. Online news has decimated many newspapers. Even technology companies like Nokia and BlackBerry were caught flat-footed by the invention of the iPhone. The obvious question is whether the car industry is next. Companies like Google, Tesla, and Uber are aiming to disrupt conventional car companies from three different directions, and history suggests that even very well-managed companies struggle to cope effectively with this kind of threat. A basic problem incumbents often face is that they become addicted to profits from their existing markets. In Ford’s case, for example, gas-guzzling pickup trucks are a huge moneymaker. It would take tremendous discipline for a CEO to put that business on the back burner and focus on developing a much smaller market that might not become profitable for years. And many people connected to the car business don’t believe that car companies are facing the kind of threat photography companies and record labels faced 20 years ago. Dave Sullivan, an industry analyst and Ford veteran, is one of them. “Making cars is hard,” he argues. “I would argue that making a CD is not very hard.” Sullivan expects that Silicon Valley companies like Tesla will struggle to produce cars at the scale of a big car company like Ford. There’s certainly some evidence for this view. A few years ago, Google designed a pod-like prototype of a self-driving car with no steering wheel or pedals. But more recently, Google seems to have decided that designing its own cars is too much work; it signed a deal with Chrysler to supply hundreds of Pacifica minivans that it fitted with Google’s powerful sensors. So it might not matter that much if Ford develops its own self-driving software. There are now a number of companies creating self-driving car software. As they mature, Ford may be able to play them against each other to get favorable terms. The problem is that software is often a winner-take-most market — think about Microsoft’s dominance of PC software or Google’s dominance of search. If that happened in the car business, most of the power and profits would shift to the dominant software maker, leaving car companies with scraps. That’s especially true because many experts believe ride-hailing will become the dominant business model in the self-driving age. Your typical Uber customer doesn’t care what model of car comes to pick them up. If this becomes the default way people get around, car companies could lose their direct relationships with customers and the clout and profits that come with it. Mark Fields failed to communicate a clear strategy Mark Fields, who was replaced as Ford’s CEO on Monday. Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Ford Ford’s previous CEO, Mark Fields, certainly didn’t talk like he was taking the risk of technological disruption for granted. To the contrary, he talked incessantly about the need for Ford to be at the forefront of self-driving car technology and deliver a fully autonomous vehicle by 2021. In 2016, he created Ford Smart Mobility to pioneer autonomous and ride-hailing technologies, and in February 2017 he invested a billion dollars in Argo AI, a Pittsburgh self-driving car startup. But Fields never really explained how all these disparate initiatives — Ford Smart Mobility’s portfolio included a shared shuttle service called Chariot and a bike-sharing business — added up to a coherent plan to prepare Ford for a disruptive future. “They're behind,” Niedermeyer says. Ford has not pushed as hard as rivals — like GM, with its Maven car-sharing service — to get actual customers using the cutting-edge products they’re working on. And Fields never laid out a clear vision for how it would eventually transfer the technologies it is trying to develop within the Smart Mobility unit into its mainstream car business. At the same time, argues Sullivan, Fields didn’t articulate a clear strategy for its core carmaking business either. “Ford is first and foremost a vehicle manufacturing company,” Sullivan tells me. “It looks to me like Mark Fields put that part of the business on cruise control.” He pointed to a string of recent recalls — including defects in millions of door latches over the past three years — that have cost the company hundreds of million dollars. “You didn't hear management discussing how they were going to not let that happen gain,” he says. “The message wasn't really communicated on how they were going to fix the day-to-day operations of the business.” One sign Ford’s board shares this assessment: The company is also replacing its vice president for communications. The new pick for the job, ex-journalist Mark Truby, will report to Bill Ford, Ford’s executive chair and an heir to the Ford family fortune. That’s significant because it suggests that Ford himself believes poor messaging has been a significant factor in Ford’s weak performance and sagging stock price. All of which suggests that that the choice of Hackett doesn’t necessarily signal any dramatic changes for the company’s strategy. Indeed, Sullivan argued that Ford should move in the opposite direction. Car sales are near a cyclical peak, he pointed out, which means that Ford may have a lot of room to make lavish investments that don’t pay off for years. “Now is a time when the company needs to be more cognizant of what's going on on the manufacturing side of the business,” he said, “especially as people shift from cars to crossovers and SUVs.” Was this article helpful?

The program beat Ke in the first of three planned matches. Peng Peng/AP In the first of three matches with the world's No. 1 Go player, a Google artificial intelligence program claimed victory Tuesday. It won the round by just a fraction of a point in Wuzhen, China, but the win was enough to leave its grandmaster opponent impressed and thoroughly confounded by the result. Last year, after Google's AlphaGo dispatched human grandmaster Lee Sedol in the notoriously complex board game for the first time, 19-year-old Ke Jie expressed confidence that he wouldn't share the same fate, according to The New York Times. After all, Ke had defeated Lee several times himself. The Two-Way Going, Going, Gone: Master Go Player Loses Best-Of-5 Match With A.I. By the match's end Tuesday, Ke felt markedly different about his nonhuman competitor. "Last year, it was still quite humanlike when it played," Ke said. "But this year, it became like a god of Go." YouTube His statement feels rather apt considering that, like a god, AlphaGo is its own greatest instructor. Last year, NPR's Geoff Brumfiel broke down the basics of the program developed by Google's DeepMind lab: "It started by studying a database of about 100,000 human matches, and then continued by playing against itself millions of times. "As it went, it reprogrammed itself and improved. This type of self-learning program is known as a neural network, and it's based on theories of how the human brain works. "AlphaGo consists of two neural networks: The first tries to figure out the best move to play each turn, and the second evaluates who is winning the match overall." DeepMind has further developed the architecture of the program since it defeated Lee last year. The Two-Way How Google's Neural Network Hopes To Beat A 'Go' World Champion Also like a god, AlphaGo has been demonstrating its influence far and wide among the game's top players — including Ke, who Wired notes adopted some tactics from AlphaGo. The program played many of the world's top players under the pseudonym "Master" in online matches earlier this year, according to the magazine, and its unorthodox playing style affected Ke's. In a blog post last year, DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis explained what attracted his lab to the ancient game of Go, which has been around since at least the days of Confucius: "[A]s simple as the rules are, Go is a game of profound complexity. There are 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible positions — that's more than the number of atoms in the universe, and more than a googol times larger than chess." It doesn't hurt that the game originated — and remains very popular — in China, with which Google has a fraught relationship. Roughly seven years ago, the California-based tech giant pulled out of the country, citing discomfort with Chinese censorship requirements. Although Reuters reports that Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google parent Alphabet, watched the match in person in China, The Times notes that "there was no obvious live video of the event" available to viewers on the Chinese mainland. Chinese officials don't allow access to Google-owned YouTube, where the match was livestreamed, or to Google search. Yet Google continues to have designs on the massive Chinese market, announcing recently that it intends to bring some of its products back to China, according to Reuters. For now, though, skittish onlookers watching the next two matches between Ke and AlphaGo on Thursday and Saturday might do well to remember Geoff's reassurance: "This program will not lead to a dystopian future in which humanity is enslaved by killer robots. "At least not for a few more years." artificial intelligence China Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR The Two-Way Breaking News From NPR About The Two-Way is the place to come for breaking news, analysis and for stories that are just too interesting – or too entertaining – to pass up.

But for every coveted job, there are far more applicants than can ever be hired. If you want to get through the door at one of these notoriously exclusive companies, you want to talk to someone like Gayle Laakmann McDowell. She worked as a software engineer at Apple, Microsoft and Google, where she sat on the corporate hiring committee—and was once at the top 1 percent in terms of interviews conducted at the tech giant. McDowell has also worked with Amazon, Facebook, Uber and Yahoo to help them attract and retain top talent. McDowell, who has a bachelor’s and master’s degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania and an MBA from Wharton, is also the author of three tech books, including Cracking the Coding Interview, which is the No. 1 selling book in three Amazon categories: software development, job hunting and interviewing.   When the Observer spoke to McDowell, her advice struck us as bigger than just getting past the gatekeepers at top tech companies—it’s filled with key lessons for how to be successful in business and in life. Here’s everything you need to know, as told by McDowell to the Observer: Before the Interview Understand the culture. It sounds funny but Silicon Valley’s top tech companies tend to shun the business side of their operations. Engineers see themselves as working for engineering shops not stuffy businesses. What drives engineers is their love of engineering and building really cool stuff for customers—not enhancing the bottom line. The Google headquarters. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images It’s not all about the degree. There’s this mistaken idea that you need a computer science degree to get a job at one of Silicon Valley’s top tech companies. But that’s really not the case at all. The biggest hurdle that candidates without a computer science degree face isn’t a lack of knowledge, it’s an insecurity that they’re missing that “secret sauce” during the interview process. As soon as I ask a question that seems “academic,” they say they can’t do it even though they absolutely have the knowledge and skills to tackle it. What they fail to realize is that the problems are designed to be difficult for everyone. Recognize the technical bias. Tech companies have a huge bias toward candidates with technical skill, even if you’re not applying for a job as a coder. If you want to work at a tech company, in virtually any role, you need to demonstrate a passion for technology. Anyone can spend a weekend online learning the basics of how to write really simple code. No, you won’t build an iPhone app in a weekend. But you can learn enough of the basics to get a decent understanding of what the software development process is all about. Trust me: It’s not as scary as you think.   Build something on your own. If you’re already working at Google and you want to move to Facebook, you probably won’t have a problem making the jump. But what if you’re a coder at an insurance company in the Midwest? If you send your resume to Google, you’re not likely to stand out. So what can you do? One excellent strategy is to start a project—any project—on your own. The details are less important than the fact that you’re taking ownership of something and showing initiative and drive. So start a small business. Build an app of your own. Do whatever it takes to demonstrate your entrepreneurial mindset. You’ll also develop new skills in the process, and it can make a huge difference in how you’re perceived. Don’t get married to one skill. Whatever your role may be, don’t be married to just one skill, one technique, or one way of seeing the world. If you’re a programmer, that means not being totally attached to a single language. Sometimes, when people interview, they can clearly be very smart—but incredibly attached to one programming language. When it becomes clear that they don’t want to work with anything else, that’s worrisome. The fact that the candidate hasn’t felt the need to learn more skills is worrisome. Needs change, projects change, teams change. Tech companies value open-mindedness and flexibility. Even if you are particularly passionate about one thing, stay open to moving new directions. Facebook employees walk past a wall of graffiti at the Menlo Park headquarters. Robyn Beck/AFP/GettyImages Nine-to-5 isn’t enough. At top tech companies, extracurricular work isn’t a differentiating factor— it’s the expectation. Even if you don’t have time to build something fully on your own, as recommended above, you need to keep tinkering on the side. I once worked with a candidate at Google for a product manager role. During the interview, he started talking about how he kept chickens at his house. He was extremely passionate about building a door for the coop that opened and closed automatically to control the chickens’ movements. It sounds silly, and it had nothing to do with his 9-to-5 job description, but it demonstrated his passion for applying technical solutions to real-world problems. Practice, Practice, Practice. Regardless of the role you’re applying for, top tech companies will assess your capacity through problem-solving tests. Your performance will improve with practice—so it’s essential that you do so. Companies are so aware of the importance of practice that they now send preparatory material to candidates directly.  (Google recruiters refer candidates to my books and Facebook has hired me to teach an interview prep class for their candidates.) You can be sure of this: Your competition is practicing. During the Interview Dress to blend. If you walk into a tech company wearing a suit and tie, you’re going to look out of place and signal that you don’t understand their culture. You’ll look like one of those stuffy business folks. At tech companies, the standard interview uniform is jeans and a nice top or shirt; on the job attire might be even more casual. I recall quite clearly one candidate walked into a job interview at Apple in a suit and tie. He was extremely smart, had an MBA from Wharton, and he quickly realized he was overdressed. As the interview progressed, he started loosening his tie, then took it off entirely, and finally threw his jacket over the back of a chair. He got the job. Your interview will be challenging: Get used to it. Understand that the purpose of an interview with a tech company is to assess your skills in real-time. An interview at Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Apple is not just a chat about your past achievements. This is true of interviews for every role. If you’re a coder, it means you’d better know your core computer science concepts—and practice answering challenging questions about them. If you’re applying for a product management role, it means you need to be ready to demonstrate your product design and quantitative skills on the fly. If you’re in marketing, you can count on having marketing problems thrown at you. Don’t. Give. Up. Ever. Often times people get a problem that they don’t think they know the answer to immediately and then they just quit on themselves. Here’s what they don’t realize: The interviewer assumes that you don’t know the answer to the question. What they’re testing is your ability—and your willingness—to tackle problems that seem completely baffling. They are looking for you to keep working toward a better and better answer. If you’re ever about to give up remember this: The interview process is designed to challenge you, and even the best candidates feel “stumped.” The question is this: What do you do next? One Google candidate asked his lunch interviewers where all the “hot chicks” were…. Needless to say, the candidate didn’t get an offer. Show initiative even at the risk of failure. No matter where you’re interviewing, you want to convey a sense of initiative. Even teams at the biggest tech companies tend to believe that they operate like a startup. They value moving—and even failing—fast. At tech companies, the ethos is that it’s better to try and fail than not to try at all. I once interviewed a candidate for Amazon who hid what I thought was the best part of her resume. She’d started a gaming company that had to close its doors within six months. She didn’t bring it up because she saw it as a failure. But, in our minds, starting a company in the first place was a huge win for her. Never be lazy. There’s a category of candidate I describe as “mentally lazy.” They may be very smart, but as soon as they get a tough problem—one where the best answer doesn’t jump out at them—they either give up or ask for help. That’s a big red flag. One candidate I interviewed at Facebook was absolutely brilliant—but only when I forced him to be. Guess what? Tech companies know that in the real world, you won’t have an interviewer forcing you to give your all. It doesn’t matter that you can tackle tough problems if, ultimately, you won’t. (Nope, he didn’t get the job.) Apple’s new ‘spaceship’ 175-acre campus dubbed “Apple Park” in Cupertino, California, is nearing completion. It will house 13,000 employees. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Don’t say something stupid and screw it all up. Tech companies go to great lengths not to come across as “corporate.” Because of that, candidates can sometimes get overly chummy during the interview process during, say, an informal lunch. One Google candidate asked his lunch interviewers where all the “hot chicks” were. Lunch interviewers don’t generally submit candidate feedback but this one made an exception. Needless to say, the candidate didn’t get an offer. Tech companies aren’t stuffy—but the office isn’t a frat party. After the Interview Life is a team sport. And so is software development. I clearly remember one candidate at LinkedIn who was a brilliant developer—as long as he worked alone. But he got incredibly defensive with his teammates whenever anyone offered even a benign suggestion. It had a serious impact on his career. Another candidate, who I worked with during the interview process at Google, would dismiss all of my feedback with a quick “yep-yep-yep”—including, ironically, my feedback to him that he came off as dismissive when he did that. Interviewers are always on the lookout for those kinds of red flags. Don’t be one of those people. Stay up to date and commit to lifelong learning. There’s an expectation at top tech companies that you learn quickly and that you enjoy the learning process. When someone knows 10 different flavors of Java and nothing else, I wonder if they’ll be willing to learn the necessary skills for a new role. Technologies and approaches change rapidly and you need to be able to adapt at the same speed. There’s no better way to guard against professional obsolescence than to develop a passion for learning new things—even if it doesn’t directly relate to your job right now. Amazon’s European headquarters, nestled in the Clausen Valley in Luxembourg. Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images Always build your network. Whether you get a job offer or not, keep in touch with as many of the people that you met as possible. Even an interview that doesn’t result in an offer is still an opportunity to build your network. Tech companies are fueled by talent and knowing the right person is often the gateway to your next opportunity. The goal is to keep your network as broad as possible. Most people, including me, didn’t get referred by a friend but by a friend of a friend. Top tech companies are so starved for great talent that referrals don’t need to be close ones. Send a thank you note or a LinkedIn request to your recruiter and stay in touch. It’s never over until you quit applying. Tech companies set a high bar and they understand that they often reject good people. Maybe you, or your interviewer, just had a bad day. Or maybe you need to develop your skills set a little further. Either way, it’s very common for a candidate to get rejected and then get an offer a year or two later. Never be afraid to reach out again. Your past “failure” won’t count against you. How can I be so sure? I got rejected when I first applied to Google for an internship. The following year, when I applied for a full-time role, the recruiter expedited my interviews because I had done well, though not well enough, the last time around. When I did get hired, I went on to interview many more previously rejected candidates. I don’t care if the candidate got rejected in the past I only care about what they can do right now.

Google is testing 11 variations of black links in search results Google frequently makes changes to its search results pages in order to improve the user experience. Contributor Sergey Alakov has collected examples of what appears to be Google's latest test: replacing blue links with black ones in the user interface. Sergey Alakov on May 23, 2017 at 12:13 pm More Google appears to be testing a new look for its search results pages that would change the color of links from the traditional blue to black. First reports of the black SERP tests started to appear at the end of April, and Google already ran a similar test almost exactly one year ago. This time around, however, webmasters have noticed several different variations of the test, and we decided to try to find as many of them as we could. We’ve found 11 variations thus far, and we are pretty confident there are more. 1. Large black URLs These results feature the listing URL above the page title. 2. Small black URLs This display is similar to the one above, but the URL text is noticeably smaller. 3. Thin blue bars This display features a blue bar to the left of the search listing’s page title. 4. Thick blue bars Similar to the display above, this version features a thicker blue bar to the left of the page title in search results. 5. Black horizontal dots To the right of the URL below, you can see three small dots, aligned horizontally. Presumably, you can click this for more options or information. 6. Black vertical dots  This display is similar to the one above, but the dots are aligned vertically. 7. Blue titles In the screen shot below, you can see that the page title link is displayed in the traditional blue color, while all other links (sitelinks and URL) are black. 8. Blue URLs In this version, the URL is displayed in the traditional blue color, while the rest of the links (page title and sitelinks) appear black. 9. Colored dots The display below features four colored dots to the right of the URL.

Stop oversimplifying everything! The old days of gaming Google's ranking algorithm are over, but columnist Eric Enge notes that many SEO professionals haven't moved on yet. Eric Enge on May 23, 2017 at 10:42 am More Once upon a time, our world was simple. There was a thesis — “The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine” by Sergey Brin and Larry Page — that told us how Google worked. And while Google evolved rapidly from the concepts in that document, it still told us what we needed to know to rank highly in search. As a community, we abused it — and many made large sums of money simply by buying links to their site. How could you expect any other result? Offer people a way to spend $2 and make $10, and guess what? Lots of people are going to sign up for that program. But our friends at Google knew that providing the best search results would increase their market share and revenue, so they made changes continually to improve search quality and protect against attacks by spammers. A big part of what made this effort successful was obscuring the details of their ranking algorithm. When reading the PageRank thesis was all you needed to do to learn how to formulate your SEO strategy, the world was simple. But Google has since been issued hundreds of patents, most of which have probably not been implemented and never will be. There may even be trade secret concepts for ranking factors for which patent applications have never been filed. Yet, as search marketers, we still want to make things very simple. Let’s optimize our site for this one characteristic and we’ll get rich! In today’s world, this is no longer realistic. There is so much money to be had in search that any single factor has been thoroughly tested by many people. If there were one single factor that could be exploited for guaranteed SEO success, you would already have seen someone go public with it. ‘Lots of different signals’ contribute to rankings Despite the fact that there is no silver bullet for obtaining high rankings, SEO professionals often look for quick fixes and easy solutions when a site’s rankings take a hit. In a recent Webmaster Central Office Hours Hangout, a participant asked Google Webmaster Trends Analyst John Mueller about improving his site content to reverse a drop in traffic that he believed to be the results of the Panda update from May of 2014. The webmaster told Mueller that he and his team are going through the site category by category to improve the content; he wanted to know if rankings will improve category by category as well, or if there is a blanket score applied to the whole site. Here is what Mueller said in response (emphases mine): “For the most part, we’ve moved more and more towards understanding sections of the site better and understanding what the quality of those sections is. So if you’re … going through your site step by step, then I would expect to see … a gradual change in the way that we view your site. But, I also assume that if … you’ve had a low quality site since 2014, that’s a long time to … maintain a low quality site, and that’s something where I suspect there are lots of different signals that are … telling us that this is probably not such a great site. (Note: Hat tip to Glenn Gabe for surfacing this.) I want to draw your attention to the bolded part of the above comment. Doesn’t it make you wonder, what are the “lots of different signals?” While it’s important not to over-analyze every statement by Googlers, this certainly does sound like the related signals would involve some form of cumulative user engagement metrics. However, if it were as simple as improving user engagement, it likely would not take a long time for someone impacted by a Panda penalty to recover — as soon as users started reacting to the site better, the issue would presumably fix itself quickly. What about CTR? Larry Kim is passionate about the possibility that Google directly uses CTR as an SEO ranking factor. By the way, do read that article. It’s a great read, as it gives you tons of tips on how to improve your CTR — which is very clearly a good thing regardless of SEO ranking impact. That said, I don’t think Google’s algorithm is as simple as measuring CTR on a search result and moving higher CTR items higher in the SERPs. For one thing, it would be far too easy a signal to game, and many industries that are well-known for aggressive SEO testing would have pegged this as a ranking factor and already made millions of dollars on this by now. Second of all, high CTR does not speak to the quality of the page that you’ll land on. It speaks to your approach to title and meta description writing, and branding. We also have the statements by Paul Haahr, a ranking engineer at Google, on how Google works. He gave the linked presentation at SMX West in March 2015. In it, he discusses how Google does use a variety of user engagement metrics in ranking. The upshot of it is that he said they are NOT used as a direct ranking factor, but instead, they are used in periodic quality control checks of other ranking factors that they use. Here is a summary of what his statements imply: CTR, and signals like it, are NOT a direct ranking factor. Signals like content quality and links, and algorithms like Panda, Penguin, and probably hundreds of others are what they use instead (the “Core Signal Set”). Google runs a number of quality control tests on search quality. These include CTR and other direct measurements of user engagement. Based on the results of these tests, Google will adjust the Core Signal Set to improve test results. The reason for this process is that it allows Google to run their quality control tests in a controlled environment where they are not easily subject to gaming of the algorithm, and it makes it far harder for black-hat SEOs to manipulate. So is Larry Kim right? Or Paul Haahr? I don’t know. Back to John Mueller’s comments for a moment Looking back on the John Mueller statement I shared above, it strongly implies that there is some cumulative impact over time of generating “lots of different signals that are telling us that this is probably not such a great site.” In other words, I’m guessing that if your site generates a lot of negative signals for a long time, it’s harder to recover, as you need to generate new positive signals for a sustained period of time to make up for the history that you’ve accumulated. Mueller also makes it seem like a gradated scale of some sort, where turning a site around will be “a long-term project where you’ll probably see gradual changes over time.” However, let’s consider for a moment that the signal we are talking about might be links. Shortly after the aforementioned Office Hours Hangout, on May 11, John Mueller also tweeted out that you can get an unnatural link from a good site and a natural link from a spammy site. Of course, when you think about it, this makes complete sense. How does this relate to the Office Hours Hangout discussion? I don’t know that it does (well, directly, that is). However, it’s entirely possible that the signals John Mueller speaks about in Office Hours are links on the web. In which case, going through and disavowing your unnatural links would likely dramatically speed up the process of recovery. But is that the case? Then why wouldn’t he have just said that? I don’t know. But we have this seeming genuine comment from Mueller on what to expect in terms of recovery with no easily determined explanation of what signals could be driving it. We all try to oversimplify how the Google algorithm works As an industry, we grew up in a world where we could go read one paper, the original PageRank thesis by Sergey Brin and Larry Page, and kind of get the Google algorithm. While the initial launch of Google had already deviated significantly from this paper, we knew that links were a big thing. This made it easy for us to be successful in Google, so much so that you could take a really crappy site and get it to rank high with little effort. Just get tons of links (in the early days, you could simply buy them), and you were all set. But in today’s world, while links still matter a great deal, there are many other factors in play. Google has a vested interest in keeping the algorithms they use vague and unclear, as this is a primary way to fight against spam. As an industry, we need to change how we think about Google. Yet we seem to remain desperate to make the algorithms simple. “Oh, it’s this one factor that really drives things,” we want to say, but that world is gone forever. This is not a PageRank situation, where we’ll be given a single patent or paper that lays it all out, know that it’s the fundamental basis of Google’s algorithm, and then know quite simply what to do. The second-largest market cap company on planet Earth has spent nearly two decades improving its ranking algorithm to ensure high-quality search results — and maintaining the algorithm’s integrity requires, in part, that it be too complex for spammers to easily game. That means that there aren’t going to be one or two dominating ranking factors anymore. This is why I keep encouraging marketers to understand Google’s objectives — and to learn to thrive in an environment where the search giant keeps getting closer and closer to meeting those objectives. We’re also approaching a highly volatile market situation, with the rise of voice search, new devices like the Amazon Echo and Google Home coming to market, and the impending rise of the personal assistants. This is a disruptive market event, and Google’s position as the number one player in search as we know it may be secure, but search as we know it may no longer be that important an activity. People are going to shift to using voice commands and a centralized personal assistant, and traditional search will be a minor feature in that world. What this means is that Google needs its results to be as high-quality as they possibly can make them. Yet they need to keep fighting off spammers at the same time. The result? A dynamic and changing algorithm that continues to improve overall search quality as much as they can. To maintain a stranglehold on that market share, and establish a lead, if at all possible, in the world of voice search and personal assistants. What does it mean for us? The simple days of gaming the algorithm are gone. Instead, we have to work on a few core agenda items: Make our content and site experience as outstanding as we possible can. Get ready for the world of voice search and personal assistants. Plug into new technologies and channel opportunities as they become available. Promote our products and services in a highly effective manner. In short, make sure that your products and services are in high demand. The best defense in a rapidly changing marketplace is to make sure that consumers want to buy from you. That way, if some future platform does not provide access to you, your prospective customers will let them know. Notice, though, how this recipe has nothing to do with the algorithms of Google (or any other platform provider). Our world is just no longer that simple anymore.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s smart, cloud-based whiteboard is now available in the US Newsby Brian Reigh13 hours ago 78 4 You can now purchase Google’s Jamboard for $4,999, and that’s excluding the rolling stand, annual management fee, and G Suite subscription fee. See also: Google Jamboard is a big 55-inch 4K whiteboard due in 2017 October 25, 2016 Google’s Jamboard, which was announced last year, is the search giant’s answer to Microsoft’s Surface Hub. The 55-inch 4K touchscreen lets you access cloud-based collaboration apps like Gmail and Google Drive, provided that you are already a G Suite subscriber. It comes with two “markers” and an “eraser,” letting you handwrite and draw shapes all the while giving you the option to easily move it around with the rolling stand. Just like the Surface Hub, Google’s Jamboard is not cheap: while it may not have a starting price of almost $10,000 like Microsoft’s offering, the $4,999 price tag is still quite steep. Well, if you were looking to buy the Jamboard either for personal use or for your business, you’ll be glad to hear that Google has officially launched the smart, cloud-based whiteboard in the US, as promised. Available in three colors – Carmine Red, Cobalt Blue, and Graphite Gray – each one will set you back $4,999. However, that’s not all. If you don’t want it wall mounted, the rolling stand is another $1,349, and on top of that, there is the $600 annual management and support fee. If you purchase the Jamboard before September 30, the company will slash the annual maintenance fee by half, so you’re only paying $300 a year. The good news is that Google is running a promotion until September: if you purchase the Jamboard before September 30, the company will slash the annual maintenance fee by half, so you’re only paying $300 a year. Also, if you buy a rolling stand before September 30, it’ll also be slightly cheaper at $1,199. While the Jamboard is only available in the US right now, Google states that it will be arriving in the UK and Canada this summer with more countries becoming available over time. Again, keep in mind that you will need to have a G Suite plan, which costs $50 a year in the US. buy jamboard from google Will you/your business be buying Google’s smart whiteboard?

Google is adding an option to disable all network media notifications on Chromecast and Google Home devices Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 9:51am PDTMay 23, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares213 Chromecast Google Google Home News The addition of Chromecast network notifications probably seemed like a good idea at the time. They allow you to control media even if you aren't the one who started playback. However, you see those notifications on your device even if you're not watching or listening to the content, and you can end up with multiple cast notifications on a busy network. Google is finally making these notifications optional with a toggle that turns off all the network notifications for your Chromecast or Google Home. Previously, you could only disable the notifications on a per device basis. So, each person on your network had to go into their Google settings and turn off the notifications. According to Google's Chromecast support page, there's a toggle in the Google Home app that can disable the notifications for all content at the network level. Casting to the device will no longer produce a media notification for anyone on your network. Here's now you do it... or how you will eventually. Open the Google Home app. In the top right corner of the Home screen, tap Devices to see available Chromecast devices. Scroll to find the device card for the Chromecast you'd like prevent sending cast notifications. In the top right corner of the device card, tap the device card menu. Under Device info, turn "Let others control your casted media" off. Google seems to have jumped the gun a little adding this to the support page. No one on the AP team has this option in settings yet, even those of us in the preview program. Give it a few days and the toggle will probably appear.

This usually saves me when my remote isn't nearby to pause something I'm watching Régis Knechtel https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bdc26dc659652bf4327d7529629202ff2b4029b31075a2365de69c6365283112.gif Paul_Werner Aw, she looks so sad. It's OK, hopefully Google will fix it... someday. LOL Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I strangely have the exact opposite problem. If I start playing some music on my Google Home and stop it later (or it stops itself), I'll still have a streaming notification sitting on my phone hours later. Sadly because there is no other interface I'll have to leave that device enabled, but I can finally switch off my SHIELD and Chromecasts! Bartek Juszczak I've been on both sides of that. Sometimes the notification is there for hours when it shouldn't be an you can't swipe it away. Other times the notification of the app that's casting disappears for no reason and this one half saves me though not too much cause all you can do is pause. It's all just quite broken Bartek Juszczak Yeah the casting system is still a bit of a broken mess. With a Chromecast Audio I still can't say "Ok Google, play music on my chromecast", it just doesn't work with audio. With Google Play Music I still can't start playback on my computer. Apps disconnect and casting breaks all the time. Notifications get stuck. Different track name is displayed to what's playing etc. Unable to do anything but pause and play via the notification, should be able to skip tracks, change volume etc etc. Sometimes it all *barely* works.

YaKillaCJ The real issue is Google needs to fix the connection issues. Even on stable and great networks, Casting disconnect. Networks where UPnP devices wouldn't skip a beat. We really should have advanced options to refresh rates and option to disable sleep while casting for example. Also part of the issue is the lack of ability to use Casting while offline. I shouldn't have to be online for casting local content. All I'm saying is to fix the real issues and they wouldn't have to try and force annoying notifications to everyone. 4Ui812 I turned this shit off on my phone as soon as they added it. I kept shutting off other people's cast by accident thinking I was the one who started it. boop Seem like it's broken on O anyway Ryan It should have been an "opt in" feature. I cant say how many times my girlfriend would break casting before we figured this out. Bartek Juszczak It shouldn't have been. This means that if my grandparents get chromecasts/cast devices, it will be super easy for them, either of them can pause or control any chromecast at any time, it's super convenient and if it's not on by default they'll never know it exists. What it should be is a pre-selected option during the initial cast device setup "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing." Ryan "Allow others in my home to see and control what's playing.", So opt in then? And odds are your grandparents were more likely to constantly just be shutting eachothers casts off like everyone else. Bartek Juszczak Opt-in as in not on by default but can be turned on? This would be preselected as on, if you just quickly skip through the setup it would be on. If you pay more attention you can untick it. Opt in would mean most people wouldn't have it, either because they skipped through setup quickly or because it's unticked by default, so if they're not familiar with it it feels safer to leave it off. And no, a lot of people do use it as intended and not to switch each other's stuff off. Though if the notification said who's casting, had next, previous and volume control buttons, it would be far more useful. YaKillaCJ I disagree. I see it as a nuisance, invasion of privacy, and lacks useful functionality. The very idea is that the device that started the casting is the remote. Not every connected device becomes a remote. I can see and understand its use case but it should definitely have been opt in. Cory S I live alone, so the most annoying thing about these notifications for me is they aren't consistent. I never know if I pull my phone out of my pocket if the damn thing will be there or not. nxtiak I wish we can ADJUST the volume. I have Google Home playing to my Chrome Audio in my kitchen, sucks that I can't adjust the volume of it using this notification. neoKushan It's not just the volume, all you can really do with the notification is pause and stop. I find this incredibly frustrating, if I've got the app installed I should be able to have full control, or at the very least next/previous - you know, basic media controls for your media notification. Cliff Robertson Oh boy. The notifications I blocked months ago will have a setting to turn it off... Shane Hull Blocked it how? trwnh Thank God. Finally. Richard Branches https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9718c51c9544e88fcd9c489ee5cca7dd7feaef70a61d54217bdbdbd76015224e.gif whispy_snippet The thing is, I actually like the feature on my home network. I'd prefer to keep it on. But what DOES annoy me is when I get two cast notifications for something I'VE cast. Has this been addressed yet?

Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Aims To Connect Online Ads to Real-World Sales By Michael Liedtke PUBLISHED: MAY 23 2017 Google already monitors your online shopping -- but now it's also keeping an eye on what you're buying in physical stores to try to sell more digital advertising. Google's computers will be trying to connect the dots between what people look at after clicking on an online ad and what they purchase with their credit and debit cards at one of the advertiser's brick-and-mortar stores. For instance, if someone searching for a pair of running shoes online clicked on an ad from a sporting goods store but didn't buy anything, an advertiser might initially conclude that the ad was a waste of money. With the new tool, Google says it will now be able to tell if the same person bought the shoes a few days later at a physical store. Mining Credit Card Data Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By scanning this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. But it could also deepen worries among privacy watchdogs, who are already concerned about the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Google's Opportunity The Mountain View, California, company already runs the world's biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. Google unveiled the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting is an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube . Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn't prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside extremist video clips promoting hate and violence. Smarter Tracking Google is also introducing new ways to help merchants drive more traffic to their physical stores, such as by displaying locations of nearby stores when watching ads on YouTube, something Google already does for non-video ads. Other tools are aimed at giving merchants a better understanding on how digital ads appearing across a variety of devices are affecting their sales. Most of these new analytics draw upon Google's inroads in "machine learning" -- a way of "training" computers to behave more like humans -- to interpret the data. Google's search engine and Chrome web browser are a rich source of data about people's interests and online activities that it can feed into machine-learning systems. Just last week, Google unveiled new ways that machine learning can help people identify flowers or pull up restaurant reviews just by pointing a camera. Now, Google is showing how it plans to use machine learning to make more money. Digital Dossiers Google already knows what you like based on the searches you make and the videos you watch. Online ads are then targeted to those interests. From there, Google can tell when you click on an ad and if you make an online purchase based on that. The new program takes that tracking into physical stores. Google says its computers can collect identifying data triggered by online clicks and match it with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when a digital ad contributes to an offline purchase. Google's tool won't work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can't currently access. Shoppers remain anonymous, meaning they aren't identified by their names, according to Google. And the company says it doesn't share any of its anonymized information with its customers; instead, it targets ads at individuals who fit demographic profiles sought by advertisers. Google gives its users the option to limit the company's tracking and control what types of ads they are shown -- although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings. © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.
