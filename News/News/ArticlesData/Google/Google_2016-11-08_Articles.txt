If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning'' to organise your pictures and video - and along the way, help you rediscover last year's holiday, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organise these memories - and Google has signalled that it will only get smarter.  Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: APPLE'S MEMORIES Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file - so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related". You can also add or delete images within Memories - in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organise my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. Ad Feedback GOOGLE'S ASSISTANT Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout. Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image. Unlike typical "GIF'' animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady - without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation - although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day". Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago.  SEARCHING Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognise the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favours being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. STORAGE To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16MP and videos at 1080p high definition - good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15GB for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5GB, which is enough for a few thousand photos.  - AP Saved|Saved Stories Saved|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Save|Saved Stories Next Apps story: Drowning in a sea of messaging apps Technology Homepage technology headlines Twitter to thwart cyber-bullying Live: 7.5 New Zealand quake Sleeping woman burnt by iPhone PS4 Pro: Hands on review An optimist on the future of energy Consumer drone market slumps Review: Watch Dogs 2 Where did you go Kendall?

It is a free, standalone app that can now be downloaded in India from Google Play and the App Store, and features content and user interface customised for the little ones. The company has roped in top content creators from India to create videos for the new YouTube Kids platform. The Android and iOS app interface consists of larger images and bold icons which makes it easier for to navigate, says YouTube. The new app also supports voice search to let children find videos if they cannot spell or type yet. The YouTube Kids app has channels and playlists across four categories, namely Shows, Music, Learning, and Explore. Users in India will get access to content like Little Krishna videos, new seasons of Cat & Keet and Appu - The Yogic Elephant, as well as learning shows from channels like ChuChuTV and Kids TV. These are in addition to the existing breadth of child-videos already available on the full YouTube platform, such as Galli Galli Sim Sim, Exam Fever Videos, LittleBabyGum, etc. YouTube Kids also has several parental control features to allow parents to restrict usage by children. These include controls over search settings (turning search off to not let kids find new videos via the search function), timer (to limit the video viewing time), passcode provision, and option to turn off background music and sound effects. Content from the YouTube Kids app can be streamed on TV using devices like Chromecast, Apple TV, and gaming consoles. It is also compatible with smart TVs. While Google does keep track of the videos available on YouTube Kids to make sure they are child-friendly, it also allows parents to flag content if they find something inappropriate on the platform. The app was launched in February 2015 and is currently available in more than 20 countries, with over 10 million downloads and 10 billion video views so far, according to Google.

The event, hosted by Hofstra’s Center for Entrepreneurship, allowed students to experience the unique virtual realities of each program Headsets on site had a wide range of prices, from the consumer-friendly Google Cardboard, to pricey, specialty headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Experiences offered to students included Google Tilt Brush, a 3-D drawing space similar to Photoshop where students could print out their creations as souvenirs, Ocean Rift, a smartphone-based VR program created to give users an under-the-sea experience with animals of their choosing (e.g. sea turtles, dolphins, sharks etc.) and Lucky’s Tale, a Mario-like VR gaming experience. Gaming enthusiasts and media-related majors alike enjoyed the different experiences represented at each station. The five headsets featured at the showcase (Google Cardboard, Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift and HTC Vive) demonstrated the various experiences that VR has to offer. Sharon Goldsmith, director of operations at the Center for Entrepreneurship said, “The Center for Entrepreneurship, Continuing Education, faculty computing and student computing all got together and said we wanted to have a showcase for all the different applications of VR going on on campus … We kind of just pooled all our resources and then invited a bunch of students.” The event sought to showcase the real world applications of VR headsets in fields like education, technology and business. Hofstra’s psychology department uses VR programs designed by Unity, a cross-platform game engine. The programs are aimed at testing participants’ responses to pain in a Candyland-esque environment. Other programs shown on the Oculus detailed the insides of blood vessels with clear applications for healthcare education. Sophia LaVergne, a sophomore TV and video production major said, “I really dig this whole VR thing. I am sort of starting to get into computer science a little bit. I think all of this is really awesome, especially when you think one or two people made it.” Other headsets were dedicated to showcasing the immersive entertainment capabilities of VR. “HVR-01”, an HTC Vive game that places users into an Iron Man type of setting, required users to utilize wireless controllers to avoid enemies and shoot down virtual spaceships. The game throws users into a 360 degree space with enemies on all sides, increasing the overall challenge and physicality of gaming. VR advancements in recent years have facilitated its ubiquity in the entertainment industry. With more technological improvements to come, VR is posed to change industries as diverse as film, aeronautics and medicine. Doctors have already begun utilizing the technology to practice complex surgical procedures. “I like being able to try everything out. I think it’s really cool that there was something like this for me to go to,” Lea Melendez, a freshman computer science major said. “In the mall you can sit in a chair for five minutes and pay $10.” She also talked about the evolution of video games from a simple form to the new usage the VR medium. Melendez said. “If you think about from the Atari to now, videos have become something completely different. I can only imagine another 20 years or 30 years what it’s going to be like.” Filed Under: Academic, News, On-Campus, Science & Technology Tagged With: education, Hofstra's Center for Entrepreneurship, News, Virtual Reality November 2016 M T W T F S S « Oct       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30   Connect with us     Twitter feed Tweets by @HUChronicle Pages About Advertise With Us Contact Us Contributers Connect     The Hofstra Chronicle In Print Archives Archives Select Month November 2016 October 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 January 2016 December 2015 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 August 2015 June 2015 May 2015 April 2015 March 2015 February 2015 January 2015 December 2014 November 2014 October 2014 September 2014 May 2014 April 2014 March 2014 February 2014 January 2014 December 2013 November 2013 October 2013 September 2013 May 2013 April 2013 March 2013 February 2013 January 2013 December 2012 November 2012 October 2012 September 2012 August 2012 June 2012 May 2012 April 2012 March 2012 February 2012 January 2012 December 2011 November 2011 October 2011 September 2011 July 2011 June 2011 May 2011 April 2011 March 2011 February 2011 January 2011 December 2010 November 2010 October 2010 September 2010 June 2010 May 2010 April 2010 March 2010 February 2010 January 2010 December 2009 November 2009 October 2009 September 2009 May 2009 April 2009 March 2009 February 2009 December 2008 November 2008 October 2008 September 2008 August 2008 July 2008 May 2008 April 2008 March 2008 February 2008 January 2008 December 2007 November 2007 October 2007 September 2007 July 2007 June 2007 May 2007 April 2007 March 2007 February 2007 January 2007 December 2006 November 2006 October 2006 September 2006 May 2006 April 2006 March 2006 February 2006 January 2006 December 2005 November 2005 October 2005 September 2005 August 2005 June 2005 May 2005 April 2005 March 2005 February 2005 January 2005 December 2004 November 2004 October 2004 September 2004 August 2004 July 2004 May 2004 April 2004 March 2004 Categories Categories Select Category -@Hofstra- -Arts and Entertainment- -Editorial- -News- -Sports- @Hofstra Academic Alumni Arts & Entertainment Baseball Basketball Books Briefs Cartoons Cheerleading City Columns Comics Crime Cross Country Debate 2016 Dining Editorial Editorials Endowment Equestrian Events Fall Sports Previews Fashion Featured Features Field Hockey Fine Arts Football Golf Greek Ice Hockey Its On Us Lacrosse Letters to Editor Letters to the Editor Local March Madness Men’s Basketball Men’s Lacrosse Men’s Soccer Movies Music National News Off campus On-Campus Opinions Politics Public Safety Briefs Reviews Science & Technology Soccer Softball Sports State Student Government Student Government Association Tennis The Breakdown The Party Line Theater TV Uncategorized Volleyball Women’s Basketball Women’s Lacrosse Women’s Soccer Wrestling Pages About Advertise With Us Contact Us Contributers Copyright © 2016 · News Pro Theme on Genesis Framework · WordPress · Log in

This week Google Inc. launched new updates for both apps, aiming for a simplified look similar to accessing them on an Android device or desktop. With the new updates, Gmail users can now undo send, just like on a desktop, allowing them to avoid sending embarrassing emails to their boss by accident. They can also search through emails faster with spelling suggestions so typos are automatically connected, and swipe on an email to archive or delete it. “With the new app, getting things done on the go is a lot easier—whether you’re trying to find a message your colleague sent you last month, or trying to get through your work inbox on a Monday morning,” Google product manager Matthew Izatt said in a Nov. 7 blog post. On the Google Calendar side of things, the new features were developed entirely based on user feedback. Month and week view have been added to landscape mode, and the company has also integrated spotlight search into Google Calendar, allowing users to access the dedicated Apple search engine to find events and reminders. Additionally, users can now look up dates on non-Gregorian calendars, including the Lunar, Islamic, and Hindu calendars to start. Just because these are the first major updates in nearly four years doesn’t mean that this is the end of Gmail and Google Calendar support on iOS devices, Izzat wrote. Google promises new updates in the future. Post to Twitter Post to Facebook Share on LinkedIn Share on LinkedIn Share with Google+ More Articles Think you're underpaid?

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek The Best Free Ways to Share Photos With Friends and Family (Other Than Facebook) Facebook might be the default platform for sharing photos, but that doesn’t mean it’s the only free and easy to use option out there. Here are some other solid photo sharing options to make it easy to share photos with friends and family the way you want to. The biggest thing to keep in mind while reviewing our picks to think not about selecting the one with the absolute best features, but about picking the one that will be the easiest for your friends and family to use. When it comes to family photo sharing, the deal breakers aren’t usually the little features, but whether or not everyone will adopt using the service in the first place. With that in mind, we’ve placed special emphasis on ease of use for each of our recommendations with a primary focus on photo-centered services, including key details that are particularly important when sharing with friends and family like: whether or not the viewer needs an account to use the service, how easy it is to organize your photos, how photos are uploaded (and if they are stored at full resolution and quality), and so on. Instagram If you’re looking for an easy to use alternative to Facebook in terms of simple photo sharing with a social media feel, Instagram is a logical alternative. (Yes, we know it’s owned by Facebook, but for now, it’s a separate service—and one much more focused on photos.) The service is completely free, easy to install and setup on your mobile device, and while Instagram may have made a name for itself in terms of hashtags and public photos, it’s very easy to set your account to private (which you should do right from the start!) and use it only to share with friends—effectively creating a tiny photo-centered social network just for the people you care about. On the downside, the private account feature only works if everyone has an account, which means your whole band of friends and family have to sign up if you wish to keep your photos private. Further, if the people you’re sharing with want a traditional look-at-albums experience, Instagram isn’t it, as photos flow down the feed and looking at old photos requires lengthy scrolling. While your photos are uploaded to Instagram at full resolution, they are not displayed at full resolution, nor is there any built-in way for the viewer to save the photos at all—which might be an issue for grandparents hungry for physical photos to put on the fridge. Additionally, if your primary photo workflow is more of a sit-down-at-your-PC one (as opposed to snapping pics on the go and uploading them right from the park where your kids are playing), you’ll probably want to skip Instagram altogether. Instagram has been, and remains, a mobile app, and the only official way to upload photos to Instagram is via their mobile app. The desktop site is…lacking, to say the least. Best for: People who want a social media experience centered around photo sharing. Flickr Flickr remains one of the highest profile photo sharing sites on the internet, and with good reason: the entire service is oriented around high quality photo sharing, and the free tier of the service has a lot to offer. A free Flickr account will get you 1TB of storage (more than even most prolific shutterbugs could fill up in years of shooting) as well as flexible privacy settings.  Photos are uploaded and stored at full resolution, and you can easily configure your account so the viewers are able to download the full resolution photos (or at home printing or sending them off to a photo service). Your friends and family can either sign up for a free Flickr account (and you can use their Flickr username to manage their access to your photos) or you can share individual photos, albums, or even your entire photo stream through a guest user pass delivered to them via email. By default, Flickr photos are public (unsurprising given Flickr’s history as one of the earliest photo sharing platforms) so be sure to pay attention to privacy settings before uploading your personal photos. Best for: Photography enthusiasts who want to mix hobby and family time—you get plenty of storage for both your hobby projects as well as sharing albums with family. Google Photos Previously known as Picasa Web Albums, Google Photos is a pretty appealing option thanks to the unlimited storage for photos under 16 megapixels (which make up the vast majority of snapshots taken by home photographers) and ease of sharing. Your photos are uploaded in their full resolution and once shared with friends and family (via a mobile number or email address), they can be downloaded in the same resolution. Furthermore, you can give those same people upload rights to your album which makes it useful for gathering together all, say, the family Christmas party photos in one place from all the different photographers in the group. Google Photos is one of the services we recommended in our guide to bulletproof photo backup thanks to the cost and how easily you can automate your mobile and desktop photo backups. Add in the ease of sharing with friends and family, and you’ve got a compelling option that both secures and privately shares your photos. Best for: People with lots of photos on their PCs and phones. Google Photos for mobile devices and the Google Photos uploader make automatic uploading of all your photos a snap regardless of where they’re stored. Amazon Photos If you’re one of the 63 million Amazon Prime subscribers, you’ve got a solid photo backup and sharing system right at your fingertips (even if you didn’t realize it). Amazon Photos gives you unlimited full-resolution photo backup, the ability to add up to five family members to their “Family Vault” to collect and share photos, and—like Google Photos—you can also share individual photos or albums by email or a shareable link, no Amazon account needed. With their shared access, they can upload photos (if they’re part of the Family Vault) or download your photos at full resolution for personal printing. Amazon Photos includes competitively priced print ordering (including photo products like photo books and holiday cards) right through Amazon with free delivery. If you’re already a Prime member, it’s almost foolish not to take advantage of this membership perk. Best for: People with Prime accounts that want to maximize the value they get out of their Prime Subscription and offer easy photo pooling for family members. Photobucket For readers who are most interested in sharing photos in a way that makes it dead simple for the recipients to order prints, Photobucket is a worthwhile option. While it’s a bit light on storage in the free tier (you only get 2GB free plus an 8GB bonus if you install the Photobucket mobile app), it works well as a place to put your best pictures. What Photobucket lacks in terms of storage and extra features (like albums multiple family members can contribute to), it absolutely makes up for in ease of use for physical prints. Your family members will be able to not only easily download the original images without an account (just using the shared link to your password protected album), but also order both prints and even photo products. If grandma wants a mug with Junior’s face on it, she won’t have to bug you to make that happen. We do have one strong word of caution about Photobucket, though. For some inexplicable reason, the default setting on a new Photobucket account is public (even though Photobucket doesn’t have the same public sharing vibe that Instagram and Flickr do), and if you don’t set your account to private in the privacy settings before you begin uploading your photos, then they’re simply out there for the world, accessible to anyone–definitely take a moment to dig around in the settings before you jump right into filling up the default “bucket” with your photos. Best for: People who want a photo storage/printing service that allows the user and guests to download full resolution photos. Shutterfly Like the premise of Photobucket (easy sharing + easy printing), but want a little more bang in your free account? Consider Shutterfly like Photobucket on steroids. First, Shutterfly offers unlimited photo storage—the promise to never delete a photo unless the customer deletes it is a prominent part of their business model. Second, not only can you easily share albums with your friends and family through the same method we’ve seen repeatedly throughout this list—emailing them a shared link—but you can also create a format website for your shared photos with a vanity url like fitzpatrickphotos.shutterfly.com. The only downside to the custom site route is that the only way to make it private is if all users have a Shutterfly account. One ding against Shutterfly is that, unlike the rest of the services listed here sans Instagram, there’s no way for the user or guests to download the full resolution files. Finally, it’s dead simple, regardless of which sharing method you use, for your family members to easily order both prints and any of the numerous photo products from Shutterfly. Best for: People who want unlimited photo storage combined with a very large print/product marketplace for ease of ordering. However you choose to share your photos with friends and family, we hope you’re also taking the time to ensure they are backed up safe and sound so everyone can enjoy them for years to come.

Additionally, the Android Compatibility Definition Document now lists the hardware requirements to be a Daydream-ready phone. The Daydream Keyboard and VR Services are already available on the Play Store, but Daydream is the last component needed to use Google’s VR platform. The app itself houses the VR launcher to open apps and browse through available VR content. Screenshots show a 3D launcher with floating cards and a virtual background. There is an app drawer, VR-optimized Play Store that makes use of large tiles, and in-Daydream settings. The app can also be opened when not in a VR viewer and provides troubleshooting, settings, and hardware pairing. Google promised that more Daydream-ready phones are on the way and the updated Compatibility Definition Document lists the exact spec needed to support virtual reality. In case you were wondering, phones need to have processors that feature at least 2 physical cores, support for OpenGL ES 3.2, Vulkan, and Bluetooth 4.2 and LE. Displays must update at least 60 Hz while in VR mode and be larger than 4.7-inches, but are capped at 6-inches. Also, many VR are starting to launch on the Play Store. From Google, there is YouTube VR and Google Arts & Culture VR, with Street View being updated to support Daydream. Experiences and games previously demoed are also available, including the Harry Potter tie-in Fantastic Beasts, Guardian VR, and CNN VR.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Comments By Gregg Keizer Follow Computerworld | Nov 9, 2016 1:43 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Web Browsers Internet Security Chrome Comments Google said it will deal with website recidivists that have dodged the company's punishments for spreading malware and spawning email scams. When Google flags sites for hosting malicious code or unwanted software, or running some kind of scam, users see warnings in Chrome and other browsers. The alerts appear as long as Google believes the site poses a threat. But after making changes to align their sites with Google's "Safe Browsing" terms, webmasters may ask Google to lift the virtual embargo. Not surprisingly, some took advantage of the mechanism for lifting the warnings. Sites would cease their illicit practices, but only long enough to get back into Google's good graces. Once Google gave the all-clear, the once-dirty-then-clean site would have a serious relapse and again distribute malware or spew phishing emails. To close the loophole, Google added a new "Repeat Offender" website violation to its Safe Browsing rules. "Repeat Offenders are websites that repeatedly switch between compliant and policy-violating behavior for the purpose of having a successful review and having warnings removed," said Brooke Heinichen, a Safe Browsing strategist, in a post to a company blog Tuesday. That end-around was as if a restaurant scrubbed its kitchen at the order of a city health department, but as soon as the inspector left, had employees upend garbage pails. The main impact on sites marked as repeaters: Webmasters may not request a re-check until 30 days have elapsed. The time-out was intended to discourage sites from repeating the dirty-clean again and again and again. Thus, once a site is labeled a repeat offender, in-Chrome warnings will continue to appear for a minimum of 30 days. Chrome last month was the most popular browser on personal computers by a wide margin. According to analytics vendor Net Applications, 55% of all browser users ran Chrome in October. That was nearly twice the next-most-popular browser's share; Microsoft's Internet Explorer (and successor, Edge) accounted for 28% of all browsers.

It lets you view compatible apps from your smartphone on the car's main head unit display, leaving you to keep your eyes on the road and ultimately be a safer driver. Google is all too aware that some people don't have an Android Auto head unit, either their car doesn't come with one, or there isn't room to install an aftermarket one. To solve this, Google announced an update for Android phones running Android 5.0 or later that will add a simplified version of Android Auto. That update has now been pushed via Google Play, meaning you can now get a similar Android Auto experience in your car using your phone's screen, without having to connect your phone to the car's system. The mobile version provides a simplified interface that gives you basic information from the apps it thinks you'll need: Google Maps, music and calls/messaging. You can use hands-free commands to make calls, send messages, get directions and change music tracks - and read your messages to you. The update will also automatically connect your phone to your car's built-in Bluetooth if it has it, or a Bluetooth car mount such as the Logitech SmartCar Mount. You'll have to use voice commands to find a contact to call for example, rather than being able to use your steering wheel controls, but auto launching should make it a seamless experience. Android Auto explored: Taking Google on the road Google says it's working on enhancing hands-free voice commands so you'll be able to carry out current commands by saying "Ok Google", no matter what app or screen is currently active. For example you could be in Maps and ask Google to change the song, without having to exit Maps. It may only be required for Android phones that don't have Google Assistant, as Assistant can be accessed from anywhere on the phone. Some older phones require you to be on the home screen. Now that we have the Android Auto update, we'll be giving it a test and bringing you more information as soon as we can. The Android Auto update is rolling out now but to save you constantly checking the Play Store, you can sign up on the Android Auto website to be notified when it's available to download. So far we've got it working on the Moto Z and Google Pixel phones, so suspect it will be rolling out quickly.

Chrome, Firefox and Safari will display a full page 'deceptive' warning for those websites that appear to intentionally spread malware, unwanted software or phishing pages. Further, they’ll be blocked from the Safe Browsing review process, to prevent nefarious webmasters from gaming the system. Google normally allows a review process if a site is branded as harmful. An operator can ask Google to review the site and remove the warning once it has been confirmed that the offending issue has been rectified. However, Google has observed that some websites will cease harming users for long enough to have the warnings removed, and will then revert to harmful activity. “Repeat Offenders are websites that repeatedly switch between compliant and policy-violating behavior for the purpose of having a successful review and having warnings removed,” said Brooke Heinichen, of the Google Safe Browsing Team. “Once Safe Browsing has determined that a site is a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be unable to request additional reviews via the Search Console for 30 days, and warnings will continue to show to users. When a site is established as a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be notified via email to their registered Search Console email address.” Websites that are hacked will not be classified as Repeat Offenders; only sites that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the policy.

Map Maker, the editing tool for Google's crowdsourced Maps, will disappear early next year, the search giant announced this week. Introduced in 2011 in the US, Map Maker lets you add places, "lines" (like railroads or back alleys), and "shapes" (like a parking lot or laundromat) to a map. It's open to any cartography enthusiast or business owner who wants to make sure they appear on the map, but unlike Wikipedia, changes must be approved before they go live. In a blog post, Google said that it will integrate Map Maker features directly into Google Maps by March 2017, at which point it will retire the standalone editing product. //Related Articles Google Maps 'Beam' Lights the Way Google Maps already offers basic editing capabilities, including suggesting updates or reporting a closed business. It does not offer the ability to edit roads or other geographic features. Google said it will update Maps to add road-editing capabilities and other features in advance of Map Makers' retirement. Starting this week, edits made in Maps will no longer show up in Map Maker for approval. Although Google Maps has proven reliable as smartphone owners increasingly use its mobile app for in-car navigation instead of standalone GPS units, the crowdsourcing model has occasionally resulted in problems. A spate of incidents early last year caused Google to temporarily suspend community edits. When they returned, the company revamped its approval process, designating "Regional Leads" who are responsible for reviewing edits made in their countries. Uber, one of the many third-party apps to rely on Google Maps, announced this past summer that it will spend $500 million to develop its own mapping software via camera-equipped vehicles. Uber said that much of Google Maps data, such as topographic maps of the ocean, wasn't useful.

Google is cracking down on sites that purposefully circumvent its Safe Browsing warnings. To protect Web users from dangerous corners of the Web, Google shows warnings on deceptive sites that violate its malware, unwanted software, phishing, and social engineering policies. Webmasters can request a review if their site is flagged, and Google will remove the warning if it finds that the site is no longer harmful. This security service has been around for years, but some site employ shady tactics to get around Google's protections. "Over time, we've observed that a small number of websites will cease harming users for long enough to have the warnings removed, and will then revert to harmful activity," Brooke Heinichen from Google's Safe Browsing Team wrote in a blog post. So now, Safe Browsing will start classifying these types of sites as "repeat offenders," and banish them to the bad list for at least 30 days. //Related Articles Google's Safe Browsing Now Targets Fake Download Buttons "Repeat offenders are websites that repeatedly switch between compliant and policy-violating behavior for the purpose of having a successful review and having warnings removed," Heinichen wrote. "Once Safe Browsing has determined that a site is a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be unable to request additional reviews … for 30 days, and warnings will continue to show to users." Rest assured that if your website was hacked, it won't be classified as a Repeat Offender; this policy is for sites that purposefully post harmful content, Heinichen wrote. "We continuously update our policies and practices to address evolving threats," she added. "This is yet another change to help protect users from harm online."

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google to Retire Map Maker, Migrate Features to Google Maps Local Search  News November 9, 2016 Leave a Comment Local Search News Matt SouthernNovember 9, 2016 SEJ STAFF 410SHARES 430READS 410SHARES 430READS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 410SHARES 430READS Google has announced plans to retire its standalone Map Maker product in March 2017, at which time the product’s features will be integrated into Google Maps. Google Map Maker is an online tool that has been around since 2008, which gives anyone the ability to provide information to Google Maps. Moderators would then either approve or deny the suggested contributions. One of the goals of the forthcoming update is said to be to allow the company to better focus on the editing and moderation experience within Google Maps. With Google retiring the Map Maker product and migrating the features to Maps, it will allow suggested edits to all come through a single channel. In fact, Google is wasting no time when it comes to streamlining and speeding up the editorial process. A change beginning today will see edits made on Google Maps no longer being available for moderation on Map Maker. “This will allow us to streamline our efforts, speeding up the time for an edit to get published,” the company says. Google notes that crowdsourced contributions can continue to be made through the Local Guides program. Being a Local Guide allows Google users to earn points through completing objectives like reviewing a location, adding photos of location, and so on. Google Map Maker is a more robust tool than Local Guides, with the ability to go so far as to edit roads, for example. In March 2017 we can expect the unique feature set offered by both Local Guides and Map Maker to be merged into Google Maps. This makes a whole lot of sense from both a user standpoint, and a company standpoint. It’s a better experience for users to have all of these features accessible to them in one application. From a company standpoint, it could lead to increased use of the features being migrated over to Google Maps. In addition, with those features being available on another application, it makes sense to retire Map Maker at that time.

Google has decided to pull the plug on its free Map Maker tool that people have used for more than eight years to make community edits to content in Google Maps. The company will formally retire Map Maker as a stand-alone product in March 2017 and integrate its features directly into Maps. Doing so will allow Google to focus on enabling the best editing and moderation capabilities right within the desktop and mobile versions of Maps, the company announced this week. Google will continue to roll out new features and update existing ones so the user community can continue to contribute to Maps. But there will no longer be a separate stand-alone tool for doing it. "Starting today, edits made on Google Maps will no longer be available for moderation on Map Maker," Google's statement noted. "This will allow us to streamline our efforts, speeding up the time for an edit to get published." Google launched Map Maker in 2008 as a tool for users to add, edit, modify and update content on Maps. The tool, for instance, allows anyone to add a location for a public place, a business or a restaurant by simply opening up Google Maps and choosing the "Add a missing place" option from the menu. Or it lets them search for a particular location on Maps and then choose the add option if it isn't already there. Similarly, a "Suggest an edit" option gives users the ability to submit information to Google for updating or correcting information in Maps. People could use it to notify Google of a place that might have permanently closed or have a different name, incorrect address, website or phone number, for example. It allows businesses to fix information on business listings in Maps or to claim and verify their business on it. All edits and updates submitted via Map Maker go through a review process involving teams from Google and selected members from the user community. Earlier this year, Google added new options for people using the Maps application on Android or iOS devices to add places or to edit existing information on landmarks and businesses. In addition to standard information on a business—likes its hours of operation, address and phone number—Android and iOS users can now add other information like overall service quality or whether a restaurant serves vegetarian food and offers outdoor seating. In announcing the new options, Google also introduced a way for users to approve updates and edits suggested by others via their Android devices, iPhone or iPad. When someone suggests an edit to a particular location in Maps, Android and iOS users now have the option of viewing the suggested edit and verifying if it is accurate. The suggested information is added to Maps once Google determines that a sufficient number of users have verified and approved the data. Google's experiment with community edits on Maps hasn't exactly been incident-free over the years. In 2015, for instance, Google temporarily suspended the ability for people to make edits after some users abused the capability to make incorrect and even obscene edits to Maps. The most notorious of such edits was one that had Google's well-recognized green Android robot icon urinating on an Apple logo.           LATEST ENTERPRISE APPS ARTICLES   Windows 10 Sticky Notes Grow More Insightful in More Languages Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters IBM Launches Project Intu for Embodied Cognition Microsoft Releases First SharePoint Server Feature Pack Google to Shelve Free Map Maker Tool                 Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

Deciding which device makes the most sense for you, though, is a whole other story. For years, I was a reluctant Roku kind of guy. I had a set-top box that let me play stuff from Netflix, YouTube, and other such services in my living room. Like most streaming devices I'd used, it was clunky and annoying -- but it was a lesser-of-evils sort of situation that I begrudgingly accepted, with the hopes that something better would eventually come along. And boy, did it ever: Three years ago, Google's first Chromecast hit the market and changed everything I thought I knew (and hated) about internet-to-TV streaming. It was a "brilliantly simple solution to a problem that's been overcomplicated for far too long," as I wrote after a month of living with the gadget: No clunky on-screen menus to navigate, no extra remotes to lose, no unnecessary hassles. To borrow a line I once heard somewhere, it just works. What a relief. At $35, it seemed almost too good to be true. And 2015's also-$35 second-gen Chromecast only made the experience (slightly) better. At last, I'd found my utopia; I was fully on board with the remote-free, phone-centric streaming setup and thought it was my eternal answer. But then, something changed. A feeling that had been building up in me for a while just kept growing stronger -- and it was a feeling that was very much at odds with the same core principles that had attracted me to Chromecast in the first place: I wanted to spend less time tethered to my phone. Crazy, I know. But much as I love mobile technology, I've reached a point where what I like the most is finding ways to make it enhance my life instead of taking it over. Sure, I enjoy scrolling through social media or checking up on the latest headlines as much as the next guy -- but there's a difference between deliberately engaging in such activities and just mindlessly swiping around while also doing something else. When my phone's in front of me in the evening, it's like having a bottomless box of Skittles right within my reach. Sooner or later, no matter what else I'm doing, I'm gonna reach up and start poppin' those bad boys into my maw without even thinking about it. With my phone, though, what I'm getting isn't a delicious fruity treat; it's a stream of information that keeps me connected to work, takes me out of the actual moment and away from the people I'm with, and makes it difficult for my mind to unwind. Sometimes, that's okay. But increasingly often, I'd rather just set my phone across the room and be purely present in my physical environment. And that's what led me to raise an eyebrow when I first heard about Xiaomi's new $69 Android TV Mi Box. Plain and simple, I want to reduce my dependency on my smartphone for around-the-house activities so I at least have the option to disconnect and put my phone away when I'm relaxing. My wife has the same feeling -- and looking forward to the future, we also like the idea of our daughter being able to play music or videos on the TV without needing a dedicated device in her hand. It's felt like a meaningful upgrade without any subtractions or added compromises So why Android TV -- and why, specifically, the Mi Box? It may seem like an odd series of choices, I realize, but I had some carefully thought out reasons. The first is perhaps the most important: While I don't want to have to use my phone anytime I need to play something, I still think casting is a fantastic and frequently useful concept -- and I don't want to lose that capability. Android TV, as it turns out, essentially has Chromecast built into its core: You can cast content from a mobile device or computer to an Android TV box just like you can with a Chromecast, and the experience is practically identical. The only difference is that you also have the option to use a regular remote if/when you want. For me, this represented the best of both worlds. (There is one asterisk: Unlike Chromecast, Android TV doesn't let you use your own Google Photos collection as a screensaver. But there's a pretty easy way to get that feature back.) As for the Mi Box itself, it was the first Android TV box with a price and feature set that actually appealed to me. At $69, it wasn't an enormous investment; in fact, it's the same exact price as Google's new 4K-capable Chromecast Ultra. And it, too, is capable of streaming 4K-quality content. Again, best of both worlds. The Mi Box's on-screen user interface, meanwhile, is basically just the straight-forward Android TV UI. (Xiaomi does put its own "recommendations" section onto the home screen, but that's easy enough to get rid of.) Using it doesn't make me want to gouge my eyes out, which is more than I can say for most set-top box interfaces. The same goes for the small and simple Bluetooth-based remote; it gets the job done and doesn't cause me any extra headaches. Some folks criticize Android TV for lacking in apps or games. That may well be a valid criticism, but it's just not relevant to my needs. All I'm looking for is a simple way to stream basic content from places like Netflix, YouTube, and Google Play Movies onto my TV -- and the Mi Box does that with ease. (It's worth noting that Android TV does lack an official Amazon Video app -- you can thank Amazon for that -- but I'm not too worried about it, personally. If that's important to you, there are a couple of workarounds.) Some also point out that Google doesn't seem to be fully committed to Android TV as a platform. And it's hard to argue: Android TV often feels like a bastard stepchild in the company's lineup, and it certainly hasn't been getting much attention compared to other efforts as of late. But remember: All we're talking about here is a relatively inexpensive set-top box. It does everything I need right now, and there's honestly not much more I want from it. Speculation over the long-term fate of its underlying platform just isn't a huge concern for me in this context. I'll leave the full and formal reviewing to the streaming tech specialists, but from my perspective, I'd say this: If you have a Chromecast and are 100% fine with using your devices as remotes all the time, there's probably no reason to get an Android TV system like the Mi Box. Similarly, if you already have some other set-top box that's meeting your needs -- Android TV or otherwise -- there's no real reason to drop 70 bucks on something new. If you want a simple one-stop solution for both casting content and using a regular remote to control playback, though -- and/or want to bump up to a system that can handle 4K video -- the Mi Box might just fit the bill. For me and my family, it's felt like a meaningful upgrade without any subtractions or added compromises. And that impossible-seeming ideal is exactly what we wanted.

This is part of the reason why Google is continuing to make small improvements to the app and add functionality that is not available via other mapping applications. The new update to the Google Maps beta application includes three “major” changes while putting the pieces in place for a future update. The first of these is the ability to start your travels within Satellite Mode, which may not be the first thing folks think about, but is a convenient option nonetheless. The next addition helps improve your experience when checking out new restaurants. Now, you will be able to see whether a restaurant has been mentioned in other articles or lists. This will help determine whether you should check a restaurant out, or keep on driving for the next one. Finally, Google has made adding a stop to your route a bit easier. Previously, you could search for a location and add it to your stops, but this was a bit precarious due to the placement. Now, the “Add Stop” option is a big blue button which should make it easier to select the right option when planning your travel routes. What’s new: Toggle to always start in satellite mode “On these lists” section for some restaurants Refreshed look for Add Stop screen As for what is coming in the future, Google has added lines of code which appear to show plans to showcase various hotel deals. It’s unknown when Google will integrate this service, but being able to check hotel rates while planning your trip will definitely save you time, and hopefully some money. The latest update continues Google’s quest of turning Maps into the quintessential directions service on the market. Although these updates are currently in the beta version of the app, there is a chance those running the stable version may not see these new features.  [Android Police] Download on Google Play local_offer    Google Maps   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (2) stars Further Reading Use this Google Maps voice search cheat sheet Google Maps direction notifier improved Google Maps adds support for Lyft and Gett Google Maps beta update flies in Level 4 Local Guides will only receive 100GB of Drive storage stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Now that’s something that could really Make America Great Again. Unfortunately, that’s not happening either. According to a Bloomberg report, Alphabet’s Project Wing unit has put the kibosh on a partnership with Starbucks. The report says Google’s parent company is making cutbacks within the drone division and apparently delivering pumpkin spice lattes to office workers who can’t get out on their lunch breaks is no longer a priority. Related: What is Project Wing and when will it take off? In an email, a spokesperson for Alphabet X wrote: “Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world. "What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." Although the Starbucks deliveries are off the table for now, Google is still on track with its plans for an express burrito service. In September it inked a deal with the Chipotle, the purveyors of marginally flavorful Mexican food. Google’s drone strategy has shifted focus to the commercial market following early plans to delivery health cares supplies. Alphabet is in direct competition with Amazon, who plans to deliver items from its online store through the Air Prime initiative.

Music, movies and media: The future of artificial intelligence November 9, 2016 Jude Hanno News No comments Artificial intelligence is defined as a machine mimicking cognitive human functions. Artificial intelligence machines are now able to create music, make movie trailers and even write news media. Google has utilized artificial intelligence for the creation of music. Project Magenta, announced by the Google Brain Team, has two goals. According to the official Project Magenta site, the Google Brain Team’s first goal is to advance art in machine intelligence. They want to “explore developing algorithms that can learn how to generate art and music, potentially creating compelling and artistic content on their own.” “Second, Magenta is an attempt to build a community of artists, coders, and machine learning researchers,” the site said. They want it to be simple for artists to incorporate music created by artificial intelligence into their own music. The system involves feeding many songs to a machine loosely wired to model the human brain, which gives it information to generate music on its own using a combination of all it has heard. Project Magenta’s leader, Douglas Eck, said “We don’t know what artists and musicians will do with these new tools, but we’re excited to find out.” An artificial intelligence machine also made a movie trailer for Kate Mara’s upcoming film, Morgan. Led by IBM Watson, the trailer was made by a computer that was consulted and tasked with making the scariest promotional video possible. Watson was given 100 classic horror movies to analyze. After its analysis, it was fed the entire Morgan film and programmed to make the trailer. The trailer is currently available on “Youtube” titled “Morgan: IBM Creates First Movie Trailer by AI.” Although writing music and publishing movie trailers are a new concept for artificial intelligence, companies are already having robots write news stories. According to Wired, many companies give data to computers that spit out entire articles. “The Associated Press uses software to generate news stories on corporate earnings reports. Fox auto-generates some sports recaps that appear on its Big Ten Network site, while Yahoo uses similar technology to create fantasy sports reports custom-made for each of its users,” said the Wired article.

Android Police reports that it has received a number of comments about the issue from readers throughout North and South America who’ve had difficulty with the band. Google Product Forums users are also discussing the issue. Additionally, MobileSyrup‘s Pixel users (myself and Senior Editor Patrick O’Rourke) are also experiencing issues, both for the Pixel XL and the Pixel. The drops in connectivity occur randomly, but with a fairly high rate of frequency — several times a day, in my experience. When the connectivity drops it can take several minutes to return, often necessitating a reboot. I’m currently on Bell’s network through Virgin Mobile while my colleague is using Telus’ network through Koodo. Both networks use band 4 as a main LTE band. According to AP, users have also reported issues on other bands, but band 4 is the main cause for complaints. Other users on networks that employ band 4 are not reporting complaints, which may also indicate that the issue is related to specific band 4 networks, not band 4 as a whole. It should be noted that after tweeting about the issue, MobileSyrup received responses from multiple Telus customers stating that, contrary to our experiences, their connection was dependable. The Made by Google Twitter account also responded to my and Patrick O’Rourke’s tweets, advising us to pop the SIM, clean it and put it back in — essentially the cell phone equivalent of ‘Is it plugged in?’ @Patrick_ORourke Hi Patrick. Let's try to eject the sim card, clean out any dust/lint, reinsert it & restart device. Does that help? — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) November 7, 2016 I then followed up with the Made by Google team via phone, where I was assured that this was not a known issue and quickly offered a replacement. MobileSyrup has reached out to Google’s PR team for comment, and will update the story if and when the company makes a statement.

I carry an iPhone 7 Plus and a Pixel, both with Rogers SIMs and my Pixel always gets a signal before my 7 Plus and it also switches to LTE before the 7 Plus does.

The assistant will be based on technology gained with Samsung's recent acquisition of Viv Labs. The plans call for Samsung to incorporate the AI into its family of electronics and appliances, ranging from mobile devices to wearable technology and home devices. Rhee Injong, CTO of Samsung's mobile communications business, was one of several executives who briefed Reuters on the plans. Samsung may delay the introduction of the new phone past the Mobile World Congress in February, pushing the launch to as late as April, according to The Wall Street Journal. The company may add a button on the side of the S8 to launch the AI capabilities, similar to the buttons for launching Siri on Apple devices. "Samsung is excited to begin integrating initial AI capabilities into its future products and we look forward to sharing further details at a later date," a spokesperson said in a statement provided to TechNewsWorld by company rep Ashley Wimberly. Smart Enough? In the aftermath of the Galaxy Note7 debacle, there is skepticism that Samsung's revelations concerning plans for a digital assistant amount to much more than face-saving hype. "Personally, I'm a little wary about Samsung's ability to compete in this space," said Jitesh Ubrani, a senior research analyst at IDC. "Without search and large amounts of user data, it will be quite difficult for Samsung to differentiate their AI from others," he told TechNewsWorld. Amazon, Google, Microsoft and others have years of consumer data to build on artificial intelligence platforms that rely on learned user preferences to work in an optimal way, Ubrani noted. Their existing AI technologies include Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant and Microsoft's Cortana. The proof will be in the pudding as to whether Samsung truly can assemble a new AI digital assistant that can compete, said industry analyst Jeff Kagan. "There are many different versions of AI," he told TechNewsWorld. "Some are really advanced and interesting and real. Others are just there to let a company use the term to gain media attention. "The real question is which is Samsung's AI?" Kagan asked. Although Viv Labs is a startup, it is not a babe in the woods when it comes to AI systems. Its founders are Siri developer Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham. The open AI technology they developed for Viv Labs is designed to allow third-party developers to integrate digital assistants using natural language into their apps. Viv Labs will coordinate closely with Samsung but continue to operate essentially as an independent company. Major Flameout The plans come at a critical time for Samsung, which is working to extract itself from one of the biggest debacles in the history of mobile electronics. The company had to recall millions of Samsung Galaxy Note7 smartphones due to safety issues. Many phones overheated and some caught fire in dozens of incidents around the world. The devices were banned from commercial flights amid reports of some spontaneously catching fire on board aircraft. Samsung last week announced that it had collected 85 percent of the recalled devices and said it would be issuing a software upgrade that would limit the power from the unreturned phones' batteries to 60 percent. Working with the U.S. Product Safety Commission, Samsung launched a recall of the defective phones, found a different supplier of lithium-ion batteries, and offered replacements. However, some of the replacement devices were vulnerable to the same type of random overheating that had occurred in the original phones. Samsung issued a recall of all Note7s, including the replacement phones, and warned its customers to stop using them immediately. While the recall of Galaxy Note7 phones was ongoing, the company found it necessary to recall another product: top-loading Samsung washing machines sold between 2011 and 2016. The CPSC last week ordered the recall of 34 different models of Samsung washers -- a total of 2.8 million machines -- warning that the top of the machines might unexpectedly detach from the chassis, posing a potential risk to users. There have been 733 reported episodes of strong vibrations or detachment of the tops of the machines and nine reported injuries, including a broken jaw and an injured shoulder. The recalls were particularly damaging to Samsung, which had enjoyed a reputation of making high-quality products and being responsive to customers.

By Brandon Russell | November 9, 2016 Share Over the past few months, there’s been a new iPhone and the first smartphone made by Google. So, now’s as good a time as ever to release a new smartphone, right? That appears to be the thinking from OnePlus, which is gearing up to release a successor to this year’s OnePlus 3, a device that’s only five months young. From what we’ve heard, it’s actually not a direct sequel. Instead, consider the device, reportedly called OnePlus 3T, a “plus” model, one that’s more powerful and capable—and, reportedly, more expensive. Rather than waiting until next summer to release a proper sequel, OnePlus is apparently planning to introduce a device with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 821 chip. There are a handful of smartphones that already offer the processor but the OnePlus 3T promises to offer the fastest experiences on the market. When we reviewed the OnePlus 3 a few months back, we loved the device’s sleek design and clean software. And at just $399, it’s one of the best well-rounded phones you can buy. While it doesn’t sound like the OnePlus 3T will offer a drastically different experience, OnePlus is reportedly making a few key changes, including that new chip. According to a tweet from OnePlus on Tuesday, the upcoming device’s Snapdragon 821 will be clocked at 2.35GHz, making the device faster than Google’s new Pixel flagship. Combined with the OnePlus 3T’s 6GB of RAM, light software, and other tweaks, and users should expect a fluid experience indeed. But the inclusion of a new chip won’t be the only big change. A rumor out of China claimed the device will pack the Sony IMX398 sensor, which has already featured in devices from Oppo. The OnePlus 3 camera wasn’t bad but it doesn’t compare to the market’s best. The new sensor should be a step up in quality. Beyond those two key changes, the OnePlus 3T could potentially include an improved display. Most high-end flagships sport QHD resolution, while the OnePlus 3 offers a Full HD screen in order to save on battery life. A QHD is by no means essential but it will bring the company up to parity with its bigger competitors. Other odds and ends may include a second storage option of 128GB and the possibility of new colors. We don’t expect OnePlus to change the device’s design since it’s already top notch, but a fresh color might help the company differentiate the supercharged model from the existing OnePlus 3. Finally, it sounds like the OnePlus 3T will come with an $80 premium over the regular model. At $480, that sits the device on the border of impulse buy territory, but it still undercuts many of the industry’s biggest flagships, including the Google Pixel, which starts at $649. I have no doubts the OnePlus 3T will be every bit as good as the OnePlus 3, if not better. But I’m very curious to see is how OnePlus markets the device to its customers. The company has built a loyal fanbase over the past few years through word-of-mouth and positive customer rapport. How will these followers respond to seeing a more powerful device released five months after the OnePlus 3 came out? You also have to question whether OnePlus can even keep up with demand heading into the holiday season. Right now, the OnePlus 3 shows out of stock for the silver and gold models and it’s been that way for a while. Back in August, the company had to halt sales in 20 countries because it couldn’t keep up with demand. If the company can’t keep the OnePlus 3 in stock, how does it expect to sell a device with different components? And is this a release cycle customers should expect going forward? A powerful device over the summer following by a slightly more powerful version just a few months later? Based on what we’ve heard, the OnePlus 3T will only provide a marginally improved experience over the OnePlus 3, so existing owners shouldn’t feel too left out in the cold. But, still, it’s odd to see the company gearing up to release another device when it can’t even keep the original in stock. Sadly, that’s an all-too-familiar motif with OnePlus—something the company has struggled with from the beginning. This is all assuming the OnePlus 3T exists and is what we think it is. We’ll find out more when the device is announced on Nov. 15. Topics #OnePlus #OnePlus 3 Brandon Russell Brandon Russell enjoys writing about technology and entertainment.

Without the use of any cameras or visual sensors of any sort, RadarCat quickly deduces whatever object is placed on it, distinguishing between apples and oranges, smartphones and tablets or anything else. RadarCat uses Google's Project Soli as its basis. The Google project, which was completed last year, is an experimental smartwatch sensor that can recognize even the tiniest of gestures. Though it was never made available commercially, Google shared the tech with select labs, including the researchers at St. Andrews. RadarCat is so sensitive that it can recognize whether a glass is empty or full, and it can even recognize what type of liquid is inside. As such, one of RadarCat's potentially limitless use cases could be to automatically alert servers when consumers need a new drink.

Now, repeat offenders will be unable to appeal for up to a month.More Google does its best to protect Chrome and Google Search users from unsafe websites via Safe Browsing, an on-screen alert that prevents the browser from automatically visiting a website that’s been flagged as unsafe. But it doesn’t catch everything — in particular websites that, once flagged by Google’s algorithms, temporarily “clean up” their activity in order to avoid triggering Safe Browser’s short-term detection. That’s why Google is changing how the feature works: on Monday, the company said “repeat offenders” — sites that draw Safe Browser’s algorithmic ire more than once — will remain on a blacklist for 30 days. “We’ve observed that a small number of websites will cease harming users for long enough to have the warnings removed, and will then revert to harmful activity,” Brooke Heinichen, a member of Google’s Safe Browsing Team, said. Related: New Android banking malware steals your data with the snap of a selfie Previously, Safe Browsing only temporarily halted navigation to sites that’d tripped Google’s anti-malware systems. Going forward, Google said, websites that “repeatedly switch between compliant and noncompliant behavior” — the latter of which includes distributing malware or unwanted software, or perpetrating phishing and social engineering — will be unable to appeal Safe Browsing for 30 days. Google will notify affected webmasters through Search Console, Google’s web development portal. And it will send an email to website owners who’ve registered an address. Heinichen stressed that “hacked” websites — webpages that have been illicitly commandeered by bad actors — won’t be subject to the new policy. “Only sites that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the policy,” Heinichen said. Related: Google safe browsing API is here to make Android apps a whole lot safer from malware Then changes to Safe Browsing come as Google expands the feature’s reach. Earlier this year, Safe Browsing hit Android as part of an update to the company’s Google Play Services suite and version 46 of Chrome for Android. It’s “highly optimized” — Google said that thanks to mobile devices’ limited storage, slow connectivity, weak processors, and limited batteries, it had to minimize the number of bits of security data. More recently, Google brought Safe Browsing to Gmail for Android in the form of a message that warns users when they receive an email from an unauthenticated sender. Related: Google sneaks in upgrade of Safe Browsing API, says it’s been guarding some users for months The improvements to Safe Browsing are timely. According to Kaspersky Labs, the first quarter of 2016 saw a “dramatic increase” in the number of unsolicited emails containing malicious attachments. The threat to businesses are particularly acute: Symantec reports that last year, phishing campaigns targeting employees increased 55 percent. Google said Safe Browsing protects more than two billion internet-connected devices worldwide.

We’ve all sent ill-advised messages to bosses, friends, relatives or ex-lovers and then instantly wished we hadn’t. Now Google has stepped in with a safety net to “prevent embarrassing email mistakes.” It has just announced an update to the iOS version of its Gmail app, which runs on Apple iPads and iPhones. Product manager Matthew Izatt said the changes represent “the biggest overhaul of the app in nearly four years.” He added: “It’s the Gmail you know and love, with a fresh new look, sleeker transitions and some highly requested features. It’s a lot faster, too.” “With the new app, getting things done on the go is a lot easier — whether you’re trying to find a message your colleague sent you last month or trying to get through your work inbox on a Monday morning.” The update also features a better search function and various interface improvements, as well as changes to the Calendar app. Users of the desktop app can already unsend emails, but this is the first time the function is available on smartphones.

The new measure should make it harder for malcious websites to continue to spread malware.Chrome users are already warned through Google’s Safebrowsing feature when websites offer harmful content. Also website owners are warned when Google detects violations of Google’s Malware, Unwanted Software, Phishing, and Social Engineering Policies. However, some websites only temporarily remove the harmful content and put it back when Google marks the site safe again. Therefore Google will keep track of websites that repeatedly offer malcious content. If a site is too frequently detected then Google will show a warning for that website for a 30 days. “Sites that repeatedly switch between compliant and noncompliant behavior within a short window of time will be classified as Repeat Offender,” Google writes on a support page explaing the new measure. The special warning doesn’t disappear by temporarily changing the website. Website owners also can’t ask Google to evaluate their site again, that’s only possible after the 30 days penalty.

The November security update for Android includes patches for 82 flaws, but the patch for Dirty COW is listed as supplemental, meaning the issue has been resolved, but the patch is currently optional. Android OEMs have the option to push a partial update, including the Android patch for Dirty COW, but it won't be a required part of a monthly Android security update until December. Dirty COW is a Linux vulnerability that can allow privilege escalation and root access if exploited. The flaw was publicly disclosed in mid-October, and experts said Google didn't have time to coordinate with OEMs to include the Android patch in the November security update. Tod Beardsley, senior security research manager at Boston-based Rapid7, said the absence of the Android patch in the November update "appears to have simply been a timing issue -- the complete patch level was already released to OEM vendors a month ago, and the patch for Dirty COW was not available at that time." Mike Pittenger, vice president of security strategy at Black Duck Software Inc., based in Boston, noted that even though the patch is supplemental, some users may still be receiving it. "Google has a process for coordinating releases with OEMs so that all vendors can issue an update at roughly the same time the bugs are made public," Pittenger told SearchSecurity. "While a supplemental patch was issued for Nexus and Pixel handsets, and Samsung has generated its own patch, other vendors remain vulnerable." Liviu Arsene, senior e-threat researcher at Romania-based antimalware firm Bitdefender, said there may have been delays in users receiving the update even if Google had the time to coordinate with OEMs. "There will still be a large number of users [who] will still not receive the fix, as we've already seen OEMs not pushing security updates for older generations [of] Android devices. This means they'll possibly be exposed indefinitely, even if a fix exists," Arsene told SearchSecurity. "While not having a full-fledged patch for Dirty COW does add more risk to Android users, it's highly recommend that for the time being, users should stick to downloading applications [from] the official store, as they're less likely to include the malicious code."

But some times websites can game the Safe Browsing system by temporarily halting those activities, as for a review, and then going back to business when they get cleared. Now Google is looking to close that loophole by flagging such sites as "repeat offenders.” The status is reserved for sites that appear to intentionally spread malware, unwanted software, or phishing pages — not websites that have been hacked. Google will tell repeat offenders of their status in an email to their registered Search Console email address. Once flagged, sites will not be able to request verification through Google's search console for 30 days whether or not the malicious content has been removed. There's nothing stopping users from ignoring the warning and visiting the site anyway, but it will no doubt dissuade a lot of users, which translates into less advertising revenue for websites peddling malware and other malicious content. Google offers its Safe Browsing API to developers so the feature is not only present in a number of its own products, but third parties such as Firefox and Safari as well.

This includes patches for nine vulnerabilities that poses a threat to users. With these vulnerabilities, the host system is exposed to remote code execution and making it possible to hackers to access pertinent information. It will be recalled that the most recent Adobe update version 23.0.0.205 and the earlier versions included security vulnerabilities on Mac and Windows, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer on several Windows versions as well as Microsoft Edge. The “zero bugs” were discovered on October 21 by the security team of Google and five days after, Adobe came up with the update on the Adobe Flash Player. Microsoft, on the other hand has not yet made fixes to the bug. The software giant also mentioned that the disclosure of Google was too early. Their sentiments included the belief that the fixes done with the patches from Adobe are ample enough to get the situation under control and that Google should have waited for the Microsoft update before making the announcement. However, Google follows a strict disclosure policy. It was published in 2013 and this policy gives the vendors 60 days for vulnerability patches or else, users will be publicly notified of the threats and risks of the flaws. For more critical vulnerabilities, the policy states that the concerned software vendor only has seven days to act on the problem. Meanwhile another patch had been done on Adobe’s “Connect” for Windows software for web conferencing. The update was made to resolve a vulnerability issue that can be used by hackers to attack cross-site scripting. As a result, “Connect” users should now have the version 9.5.7. In relation to CVE-2016-9855, the vulnerability threat has something to do with hackers being able to target a PC and run a malicious code via the Flash Player. Due to the security risks, users are advised to download Adobe Flash Player v. 23.0.0.207 and this include iPhone, Android and desktop platforms.

Google has enlisted the pop culture prince to design a six-piece range of Live Cases for the Google Pixel phone. In crafting the cartoon-patterned cases, Scott stuck with his preferred subjects: apparel, accessories and foodstuffs. On one case, overexcited champagne bottles pop their corks at the sight of flirty, foam-topped flutes. On another, snapbacks flash toothy grins as cheeky white gloves cross their fingers for luck or exoneration from lies. Jeremy Scott at Moschino Spring 2017; Image: Imaxtree Each snap-on case comes equipped with Near-field communication technology, allowing the Google Pixel to detect its presence and prompt an animated wallpaper app to appear on your screen. The cases also hold the key to a custom “J’emoji” keyboard (step aside, Iris Apfel and Kim Kardashian) populated by cutesy characters designed by Scott. New J’emojis will pop up daily, both on owners’ keyboards and in Scott’s celebrity #squad’s Instagram captions. (Because #marketing.) “What’s really exciting about these cases is that the emojis jump off the cases into your screens. I’ve never had the ability to do this before, as the technology is something new from Google,” Scott told WWD of the collab. “I was thinking a lot about how the virtual has become reality with our online lives, and avatars are speaking so much more for us than ever in the social media atmosphere that we now inhabit. So when Google came a knockin’ I was ready for them.” Frankly, the idea of an emoji leaping onto our screen at its own volition sounds a little intrusive. There’s a reason why Microsoft Word did away with Clippy, right? That said, we trust Jeremy Scott to know what he’s doing and, unlike the new Louis Vuitton iPhone cases, these Google gadgets will only set you back $40. (The phone itself costs $649.) Live Cases will be available to shop at the Google Store starting tomorrow, November 10, through the end of January.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed November Patch Tuesday fixes controversial Windows 0-day hole 09 Nov 2016 0 Microsoft, Vulnerability, Windows Post navigation Previous: Tech support scammers bite Chrome users with forgotten 2014 bug Next: Google hits incorrigible sites with “Repeat Offender” tag by Paul Ducklin 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Microsoft’s latest Patch Tuesday is out, even if Redmond’s monthly updates haven’t officially been called “patches” for more than two years now. There are 14 bulletins this time around, broken down in severity as follows: Six tagged as Critical involving Remote Code Execution (RCE) bugs. One tagged as Important involving a Remote Code Execution bug. Six tagged as Important involving Elevation of Privilege (EoP) bugs. One tagged as Important involving a Security Bypass hole. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More The patch with the most controversial backstory is one of the six EoP vulnerabilities that is documented in bulletin MS16-135, or Security Update for Windows Kernel-Mode Drivers (3199135), to give its full title. There were actually five separate bugs fixed in various parts of the kernel, but the one that grabbed the media spotlight recently is known as CVE-2016-7255, originally disclosed to Microsoft by Google researchers, who apparently encountered it in the wild. An unpatched vulnerability that’s already being used by cybercriminals earns the moniker zero-day, or 0-day, meaning that even well-informed system administrators had zero days during which they could have patched proactively. More simply put, the term zero-day generally refers to a situation where the bad guys beat the good guys to it. The controversy in this case is that Google publicly disclosed the CVE-2016-7255 zero-day after just seven days, even though Microsoft had an official patch window coming up within two weeks. Google’s claims about these automatic, algorithmically timed disclosures for what it considers “critical vulnerabilities under active exploitation” are: Seven days is a fair target to build, test and ship countermeasures for a hole that the crooks are already exploiting. The seven-day process follows documented company policy, so it can’t be considered a surprise. A one-size-fits-all policy makes disclosure timings objective, so that no one can imply that some vendors get more liberal treatment than others. In other words, if Microsoft wanted to avoid the world hearing about the hole before the patch was out, it shouldn’t have waited a further 10 days for Patch Tuesday to roll around. Not everyone agrees that such an inflexible approach is appropriate, seeing it as a sort of technical religiosity that removes the human touch in fighting back against cybercrime, and arguing that rushing a fix out against an inevitable seven-day deadline may not always be possible or desirable. Wherever you sit on the time-to-disclosure fence, Microsoft has now closed the hole that Google brought to the word’s attention, so if you need a reason to follow our usual advice to patch early, patch often, let this be it. Actually, there’s an even more compelling reason to patch early, patch often this month: bulletin MS16-132 includes a patch for an RCE vulnerability in how Windows handles Open Type fonts. In other words, a deliberately booby-trapped font could trick your computer into installing malware without any popup or warning dialog that might otherwise draw your attention to the attack. Just like the abovementioned CVE-2016-7255 kernel bug, this one gets Microsoft’s most serious exploitability score of zero. To explain: lower numbers are worse. 4 means “not affected”. When you get to 1, or “exploitation more likely”, you can assume that the crooks will probably figure it out soon. 0, however, means “exploitation detected”, which you can remember using the mnemonic that zero is short for zero-day. What to do? We’ve already used the words patch early, patch often, so that’s what to do. Of course, if you’ve already told your version of Windows to go ahead with updates automatically, don’t forget to check that the updates actually happened. And, by the way, bear in mind that the controversially disclosed kernel bug described above was used in the wild in conjunction with an Adobe Flash hole. The Flash bug got the crooks in, but only with the power of a regular user, and the kernel bug got them up to administrator level. So, we’ll take this opportunity to remind you once again, if you’re still using Flash, to try living without it for a while, given that fewer and fewer sites use it these days, and few of those still actually require it.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Fancy Bear goes all out to beat Adobe, MSFT zero-day patches The group behind DNC hack seeks maximum pwnage before patches become widespread. by Sean Gallagher - Nov 9, 2016 5:30 pm UTC Login to bookmark 30 It's been go time for spear phishing as the window for Adobe and Windows zero-day exploits closes with recent patches. Wikipedia A Russia-based hacking group is seeking to maximize the value of its zero-day exploits before patches issued by Adobe (released on October 26) and Microsoft (released yesterday) become widely available. In a report issued today, researchers at Trend Micro noted that spear phishing activity—malicious e-mails sent to "various governments and embassies around the world"—had ramped up significantly after these exploits were announced. The flaws, discovered last week by Google's Threat Analysis Group, have been used in a long-running spear-phishing campaign against government, political, and military targets in the US and Europe. It's all an apparent intelligence collection effort run by the group known variously as Pawn Storm, Fancy Bear, APT28, Sofacy, and Strontium. This is the same group blamed for the hack of the Democratic National Committee and the e-mail accounts of Hillary Clinton Campaign Chairman John Podesta, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, and other political figures in the US. While Adobe patched the vulnerability (CVE-2016-7855) with an emergency update on October 26, the Microsoft vulnerability was not patched until November 8. That's more than a week after Google announced the discovery of the exploit. Instead of using the malware solely on high-value targets, the hacking group "probably devalued the two zero-days in its attack tool" and began casting a much larger net with this spear phishing campaign, wrote Feike Hacquebord and Stephen Hilt of Trend Micro's TrendLabs. Still, the group's efforts to hit bigger targets didn't stop. "We saw several campaigns against still-high-profile targets since October 28 until early November 2016," the researchers noted. The attack generally has been based on an e-mail with a "social lure"—a document or link referencing a recent news event or some upcoming conference. The attack uses a website or a document with an embedded Adobe Flash component that runs a JavaScript component. The JavaScript portion then "fingerprints" the target and sends information about the system it was opened on to a command and control server before ultimately exploiting the Windows vulnerability and dropping its malware payload. The TrendLabs researchers called out two specific recent campaigns as evidence of the increased activity by Pawn Storm/Fancy Bear. The latest was an early November wave of e-mails to "various governments around the world" from a forged e-mail address. A November 1 e-mail from the campaign was forged to appear to be from an actual press officer for the European Union with the subject line, “European Parliament statement on nuclear threats.” The e-mail contained a link that led to a website running the exploit kit. "Internet users who were using Windows Vista up to Windows 7 without the latest patch for Flash would be at high risk of automatically getting infected," the researchers wrote. Another attack using the two exploits showed up in several e-mail waves from October 28 through this week. Some of them were purportedly invitations to a "Cyber Threat Intelligence and Incident Response conference" this month—an actual conference—sent in a malicious Rich Text Format document called "Programm Details.doc." When opened, the RTF document launched an embedded Flash element that downloaded additional files and leveraged the exploit code to install these files on the targeted computers. "We also noted that the embedded Flash file downloaded a Flash exploit for the just-patched [Adobe Flash vulnerability]," Hacquebord and Hilt reported. "A second file was also downloaded, but this file consistently crashed Microsoft Word during our tests." Now that patches are available for both vulnerabilities, it's likely the exploit tool based on them will be kept in use only for less valuable targets that may not have been patched. While anti-virus tools have been updated to catch the particular tools used in these detected attacks, unpatched systems will remain vulnerable to new attacks using the same exploits.

Copyright Getty Images Advertisement The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet Inc. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks Corp., according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves. The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. Popular Now GE Deepens Silicon Valley Push With $915 Million Cloud Purchase Samsung to Buy Harman for $8 Billion in Bold Autos Gambit Crash Sensors Are 'Most Wanted' Auto Safety Technology "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. Alphabet cost cuts drag Google's drone project back to earth https://t.co/jSvDm9WPaM pic.twitter.com/0yko9H4eNy — Bloomberg Technology (@technology) November 9, 2016 Robotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. A Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Similarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer. The status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions. Project Wing Course Correction Project Wing, like many efforts inside X, has shifted directions several times. Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said. Project Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission -- data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. Then Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X. Vos did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on Tuesday. Teller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and "really dramatically, magically, change the world." However, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received "90-day notices," which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision. Last November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a "commercial business up in running in 2017." It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. "You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery," said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. "Nobody knows how long it's going to take."

While the OS is already running on Google’s Pixel smartphones, it’s only available as a developer preview for supported Nexus devices. However, that’s not stopping the team at CyanogenMod from putting together a new ROM based on Google’s latest OS. Available now, CyanogenMod 14.1 is based on Android 7.1 Nougat and, at least for now, is mostly stripped of features aside from what comes with stock Android. As an example, CyanogenMod’s Themes functionality is not available yet. The first push of devices includes a list of nine different devices, although you’ll need an unlocked bootloader to install the ROM on any of them. Nexus 6P (angler) Nexus 5X (bullhead) Xiaomi Mi3w/Xiaomi Mi4 (cancro) LG G3 (d855) Moto G (falcon/peregrine/thea/titan) LG G4 (h811/h815) Samsung Galaxy S5 (klte/kltedv/kltespr/klteusc/kltevzw) OnePlus 3 (oneplus3) ASUS ZenFone 2 (Z00L/Z00T) Steve Kondik also mentions that “Bug reports are OK,” although he asks users not to file bugs for missing features since the ROM is still a work in progress. There’s also a call for users to get involved with the project as well since “CM is returning to its community-driven roots and there are endless ways to help out.” More devices will be added to 14.1 over the coming weeks as well.

The tool enabled users to edit information and suggest changes in Google Maps. The company has now confirmed that it’s shutting down Map Maker, but that doesn’t mean it’s going to take away the ability to suggest changes and make edits. It’s moving all of those features to the main Google Maps application. Google says that it’s moving all of the Map Maker features over to the main Google Maps application as part of its Local Guides program. The program rewards users for improving local mapping data in their community by giving them access to beta features before everyone else as well as giving them free Google Drive storage. Google had to face an embarrassing situation last year when a Map Maker user was able to get a pretty detailed drawing of an Android robot urinating on an Apple logo. That drawing was actually live in Google Maps for quite some time before it was spotted and swiftly taken down by Google. The company even temporarily shut down the tool while it improved moderation for Map Maker submissions. Moving these features to the Local Guides program allows the company to strictly moderate submissions and it may also contribute helpful information such as location edits, reviews, and additional relevant information that just improves the Maps experience for all users.

Today we are featuring Design Agency, Anthem and featuring the brand, Unox.  Tell us about your agency?  Anthem is a global creative agency that actively connects brands with people by amplifying desirability—creating an insatiable thirst for brands from package design to brand campaign. Anthem sells brands to drive brand performance. Anthem is an SGK Group company and SGK is a division of Matthews International Corporation (NASDAQ GSM: MATW). How did all start?  Clarence W. Schawk founded the business in 1953 from the basement of his aunt’s home on the northwest side of Chicago. He was newly married, and with his tour of duty as a U.S. Marine in the Pacific Theater and a few years’ experience in the industry making printing plates behind him, he realized, as many entrepreneurs do, that he could make a better product. He invested the $500 he and wife Marilyn received as wedding gifts in himself and the American Dream. The business began to grow, and through the years the name Schawk became synonymous with superior quality and outstanding customer service. Like many entrepreneurs, Mr. Schawk was passionate about the business and setting new standards in the industry for both the products he produced and the people he employed. Following a four-decade period of acquiring more than 25 prepress companies in North America, the Company began expanding its capabilities to include design and technology and to expand its footprint into Asia Pacific.  In the mid 1990s, SGK began acquiring established award-winning design agencies in the U.S. and Canada. And in 1997, SGK created a global graphics management software service for brands, the first created for the graphics industry to meet the unique demands of consumer product packaging. In the late 1990s, SGK entered the Asian Pacific market and began serving the needs of global companies in the region with local insights. During the 2000s, SGK acquired additional branding and design agencies around the world, further expanding and deepening its competency in this area of the business and branded these Brandimage and Anthem. In 2014, SGK was acquired by Matthews International and the Matthews Brand Solutions Group was integrated into SGK.  What is your showcase? What can you tell us about it?  With the Unox Soup Portfolio & Range Architecture as starting point we’ve initiated to develop a specific Unox Design Architecture. The visual brand identity system that we created and build over the last 4 years has proved to be solid, effective and flexible. It consists of the Unox branding in combination with the beacon shape that allows us to express the specific characteristics of the different propositions whilst strengthening Unox’s brand equity. It respects the heritage of Unox and its well loved ranges like Stevige whilst providing a strong platform for new introductions like Proeverij aimed at attracting new consumers to the brand. Creative director: Sara Jones Senior designers: Merle Waterman, Kim Dero Design Strategy: Arthur Brandenburg van den Gronden Account: Monique Linders What was your solution? The main objective of the brief was to reflect the various propositions from value, lower & upper mass and premium. So the extensive soup portfolio becomes much clearer for consumers as client felt that the proposition differentiation was rather weak and confusing.  A visual brand identity system (Unox logo & U-beacon) has been created to:  Clearly identify and differentiate the various propositions Strengthen brand recognition and blocking on shelf Facilitate variety navigation The U-beacon can vary in size, colour and texture as well as in content. Also the background is flexible in colour, photography and texture. Within this system food photography is playing an important role to express the lead message of the proposition. Ie. in the recently introduced ‘Proeverij’ range the delicious, expertly crafted and artisanal recipes are being reflected by seductive & honest photography which is enhanced in the final execution by a combination of mat & gloss finish. Why is this work so special and what does it say about your agency?  The work for Unox represents our agency well because of the absolute attention to food appeal. We pride ourselves on being able to give Unox a real identity when it comes to the quality and depiction of the food & ingredients – from the way the shot is lit, to the  imperfections & rustic feeling of the backgrounds and the attention to typography. Even without the Unox logo we aim to breathe the brand through the remaining visual cues. Above all, we believe that photography is the 'make or break' of food packaging, it has the ability to create desire, make you feel hungry, make your mouth water – all without a single word. The special quality of this work is the flexibility of the Design Architecture – innovations and new varieties are all able to be encompassed under this true Unox signature.  Clear thinking, beautifully designed. What makes the design Dutch? Dutch design often is simple and powerful. No-nonsense if you like. Unox designs are always simple and always bold as a result of the visual architecture that is centered around the U-beacon that allows for a single lead message presented with impact. So in this sense one can speak about a design with a typical Dutch signature Although the brand is Dutch, the audience is Dutch, the design team isn’t.  For more than 25 years the design team consistently has been an Anglo-Dutch combination so in a way this typical  Dutch signature actually is an eclectic mixture of Dutch no-nonsense with the typical Anglo ability of creating food appeal that is aspiring and desirable. No-nonsense design that aspires to be desirable.  What way would you describe Dutch packaging design? Dutch packaging design is a reflection of Dutch culture that has a strong international orientation. Dutch people like being Dutch, no-nonsense and without unnecessary thrills. At the same time their orientation is beyond the national borders because of trade, travel and holidays. And with that one can clearly see that Dutch packaging design is characterized by a Dutch no-nonsense foundation that aspires to be international inspired or fueled by international (eating) cultures. BNO NEXTpack: the next step in packaging design BNO NEXTpack is the packaging design source of the Netherlands. Inspiring convincing and surprising information about the importance of packaging design in the daily lives of everyone. NEXTpack stimulates the imagination, provides insights into the discipline and responds to relevant developments and social discussions.

It simply makes sense.  Simplicity rules the day. In our über-branded world, we’re seeing a sea-change washing over the landscape. Some say it started with Google, sporting the cleanest user interface on the web at the time. (Interesting that Microsoft’s Bing is now trying to out-simplify Google on functionality.) Others say Target paved the way, with a simpler, cleaner shopper experience, utilizing design as a strategic advantage in its pitched battle with Wal-Mart. (Equally interesting that Wal-Mart is now trying to out-design and out-simplify Target.)  Other examples abound: Häagen-Dazs touts a few simple ingredients with its Häagen-Dazs five™ line. Pepsi creates Throwback versions, harkening back to simpler times. Coca-Cola renovates its trademark brands, eliminating gratuitous and superfluous design elements to express brand symbols more simply and compellingly. Volkswagen builds an entire design language around simple forms. Philips touts “Sense and Simplicity” as more than a tag line but as a corporate covenant. Countless other brands feature simple, back-to-basic value propositions that appeal to a seemingly endless desire for the honest, the true, the uncomplicated...in a word, SIMPLICITY. WHAT’S GOING ON HERE?  This is more than a trend, even though it’s clearly trendy. It’s a more fundamental change, a cultural shift, and one that the cultural anthropologists and semioticians will be studying for decades. And the brands that recognized it early are reaping the rewards of reflecting the values that are driving the culture, even as they accelerate the shift through their powerful brand expressions.  The shift has many parents: our increasingly fragmented culture, media overload, overextended brands, SKU proliferation, and of course, the current economic reversal that fosters a deep desire for simple value as a response to the excesses of the recent past. In The Paradox of Choice: Why More Is Less, psychology professor Barry Schwartz argues that consumers today are faced with far too many choices, noting that consumers would be far better off with a few distinctly different options instead of the countless array of choices they currently have. Whether choosing an insurance plan, a can of tomato sauce, or even a pair of jeans, Schwartz shows that a bewildering array of choices is overwhelming, and paradoxically inhibits happiness instead of enhancing it. He debunks the notion that more choices will make consumers happier, offering instead the idea that having all these choices actually infringes on consumers’ psychological well being.  Author and consultant Jack Trout similarly contends, in The Power Of Simplicity: A Management Guide to Cutting Through the Nonsense and Doing Things Right, that simplicity is one solution for marketers who find it increasingly difficult to gain traction among consumers beset by too many complicated choices and options. He urges managers to “get back to basics” and use simplicity as an organizing principle to guide enterprises to success. Trout notes that simplifying the value proposition will reduce cost and increase sales and profits.  In our own practice, we’ve seen brand owners leverage the power of simplicity to strengthen their brands. Heinz, in its Australian market, launched a new line of frozen stir-fry vegetables with a fresh, confident look that communicates convenient, everyday cooking. Bright, complementary colors, ample white space, simple design, and appetizing photography suggest healthy, unprocessed, and easy to use benefits.  This trend toward simplicity and purity has also taken hold in the beverage category, where unsweetened flavored water beverages are growing faster than any other segment. Dasani Essence is an all-natural, no-calorie clear beverage that adds a hint of fruit to bottled water, including lime, black cherry, and strawberry kiwi flavors. The design took a straightforward, bold approach to the brand that conveys honesty and simplicity. The new packaging is clean, modern and stylish to help encourage a healthy lifestyle and attitude.  Gundowring Fine Foods’ design features a series of smart two-color labels; the restricted palette, minimal typography, and a handdrawn swirl create an appealing label design that conveys real food, few ingredients, and simple authenticity.  Features: ArticlesYour NameOctober 09, 20092 Comments Moodology Category: Fashion, Substrate: Paper, Paperboard, CardboardElizabeth FreemanNovember 09, 2016Moodology, Origami Owl, United States, essential oils, Jewelry SCRUB Body Scrub by Coffee Organics Category: Beauty HealthTheresa Christine JohnsonNovember 09, 2016body scrub, bath and body, scrub body scrub by coffee organics, coffee, australia, OCHO Creative Home About Awards Events Directory Jobs Submit Archive Advertise Subscribe First Name Last Name Email Address Sign Up Thank you!

To help coordinate, I asked Amy to assist and cc’d her on the email. “Amy,” I wrote, “please help us find a time to meet. Let’s plan for sushi at Tokyo Express on Spear Street.” Amy looked at my calendar, found an open time suitable for everyone invited, and booked the meeting. Amy works just like a human assistant, except she’s not human. It’s an AI bot made by X.ai, a company specializing in scheduling assistants that respond to natural language. Amy is so good at what she does that I find myself thanking her for booking a meeting, forgetting she needs no more thanks than my microwave. It’s easy to forget Amy, an artificial intelligence bot made by X.ai, isn’t human. X.ai It’s impossible to ignore all the buzz about AI bots. Last month, Facebook’s David Marcus announced that over 30,000 bots have been built since the opening of its Messenger app to bot developers in April. Other companies like Google, Amazon, and Slack are welcoming bot-building developers to their platforms with open arms. Slack even created an $80 million fund to support chatbot projects. As with any tech trend, most companies building bots today won’t survive. However, some are bound to have a massive impact and will profoundly change the way we interact with our software and services. The deciding factor between which bots will live and which will die is how well they keep users engaged. After all, if a personal technology isn’t habitually used, it is easily forgotten. Since most bot companies are built on other companies’ platforms, like Facebook Messenger, Amazon Echo, WeChat, and Slack, they must stay top of mind or they may as well not exist. So what makes for an engaging bot — one that users come back to again and again? Beyond Bots First, it is helpful to expand the scope beyond what most people call “bots” and consider a much larger and more interesting technological shift. Although “bots” has become a buzzword for the artificial intelligence powering many fledgling services, that’s only part of the story. It’s the way we interact with these bots — and the way they are designed for those interactions — that makes them special. An AI Bot uses a Conversational User Interface (CUI) to turn the tediousness of tapping through drop-downs and app menus into the simple act of asking. On a screen, a CUI looks like a text message, an interface anyone with a mobile phone understands. However, it’s important to remember that CUIs don’t necessarily require a screen at all. CUIs can work beautifully through a voice exchange. In the best cases, communicating with a CUI by just talking should feel like a chat with a good friend or a helpful assistant. In fact, science fiction inspiration like Jarvis, the virtual butler from “Iron Man,” or Samantha, the digital companion in the movie “Her,” is where enthusiasts hope this technology is headed. Engaging Conversation If communicating with CUIs is going to be as simple as talking to a good friend, we should design them as such. William Rawlins, a professor of Interpersonal Communication at Ohio University who studies friendship, says a friend has three qualities: they’re easy to talk to, enjoyable, and dependable. We form routines around turning to important people in our lives in the same way we build habits with our technologies. In my book, “Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products,” I describe a four-step model that companies utilize to keep users coming back — a trigger, action, reward, and investment. Hooks are the reason we check our tech hundreds of times per day with little or no conscious thought. Integrating the Hooked model with Rawlins’ three qualities of a good friend provides important insights into designing engaging technology that feels familiar and is the key to building great CUIs. The same “hook” that makes products habit-forming is also what makes friendships last. nirandfar.com The first step to changing habits is identifying what I call an “internal trigger.” Internal triggers are the momentary psychological pain we feel right before we use a product. It’s why we check Facebook when we’re lonely, why we Google when we’re uncertain, and why we watch YouTube videos when we’re tired after work. These services have bolted themselves onto frequently felt negative emotions. The same goes for calling upon a friend and, by extension, using a CUI. For example, Sensay.co uses an AI bot to put strangers in touch with one another. The company serves over1.5 million people across messenger services and SMS. CEO Ariel Jalali told me the company wants to “be the first place people go to when they feel bored or indecisive and want to connect with someone with relevant experience.” Whether it’s looking for a quick recommendation or a lengthier conversation with an anonymous new friend, Sensay.co wants to serve users whenever they feel the frequently occurring need for a social connection. Sensay.co is an example of a company that uses people, combined with a back-end AI bot, to scratch its users’ itch with a simple, conversational interface. Sensay.co uses text messages to quickly connect strangers in need. Sensay.co Easy To Talk To The next step of the Hooked model is the “action phase” — a simple behavior that might yield a reward, like scrolling the feed on Facebook. Like a friend, a CUI needs to be easy to talk to. It’s in the action phase that well-designed CUIs can surpass their traditional app cousins. CUIs can present information and functionality exactly when it’s needed, without requiring the user to tap through complicated menus and options or exit one app, like email, to get the task done somewhere else, like a calendar. For example, as part of the recent fanfare around Google’s new Pixel phone, the company showcased how the Google Assistant provides helpful information at just the right time by integrating with different services. If two people text about a restaurant, the Google Assistant can provide directions with Google Maps and make a reservation through OpenTable, all from within the conversation. By anticipating what’s needed and bringing disparate services together, the CUI makes communication a breeze. Enjoyable Next in the Hooked model comes the reward. The reward gives users what they came for, scratching their itch, and yet leaves them wanting more. Just as we keep engaging with friends who are fun to be around, a good CUI keeps us on our toes. For example, one of my daily habits is using Quartz, the news service that looks like a simple conversation. Quartz is both enjoyable and easy to talk to in a number of ways. First, Quartz inserts funny quips and gifs to keep me engaged while I read the news. However, Quartz doesn’t ask for too much. The CUI gives me the news in quickly consumed tidbits without forcing me to click through to an article to get the most important information. Unlike other news sites, Quartz doesn’t care if I read the entire article and understands I just want to know the gist of the top stories. If I want to get the entire story, I can follow the link, but I rarely do. Furthermore, while other news sites try to keep me scrolling through articles forever so they can rack up ad revenue, the Quartz CUI literally tells me to go away when it’s done giving me the most important stories, saying, “You’re all caught up! Check back later.” By giving me a sense of completion that I’m caught up on the day’s news, Quartz gives me exactly what I want. While other news sites feel like a nagging librarian telling what I should be reading, Quartz is easier to talk to and more enjoyable because it demands less of my time and attention while keeping me engaged with humor and surprise. Dependable Imagine you meet your friend for lunch. You sit together and as you enjoy your meal, you tell each other about what’s happening in your life. You open up and make yourself a bit vulnerable. Being vulnerable brings people closer together and you leave the lunch thankful for the relationship. Now imagine that the next time you see your friend, they don’t remember a word you told them. Everything you disclosed seems to have vanished from their memory or, worse yet, they didn’t pay attention to what you said in the first place. Unless they suffer from amnesia, this is not the kind of friend you’d like to keep around. According to Rawlins’ research, a good friend is dependable. Relationships can’t grow unless people invest in each other. We expect our investment to yield a return in the form of shared information and a history — which make us more efficient at understanding and anticipating our friends’ wants and needs. The same is true of our technology. The fourth and final step of the Hooked model is the “investment phase.” This is where, like in a friendship, we put something into the service in expectation that it will improve over time. Far too many products don’t ask for investment or they don’t reward it, collecting but never reinvesting the information that users share. But the CUI makes asking for and integrating user investment much easier and more useful. For example, the more I use Pana, a travel service utilizing a CUI, the better it becomes. (Full disclosure: I loved the service so much, I invested in the company.) Pana remembers my preferences every time I use it. Where do I like to sit on the plane? What’s my frequent flyer number? Which credit card do I use for business versus personal travel? The list goes on. However, unlike a traditional app or website that would ask for all this information up front, Pana asks for it as needed, but remembers it for life. Like a good friend, Pana doesn’t ask me to repeat myself. With all that information, Pana can be helpful in ways no other travel service can. Pana can tell me, for example, when I should buy a ticket with points versus cash and handles the transaction for me. Another case in point: Last week, on the way to Phoenix from San Francisco, I noticed I’d forgotten to enter my TSA Precheck number into my flight reservation. Instead of having to call the airline, wait on hold, and negotiate with the representative, I sent a quick text to Pana and it was done for me. A quick message sent on Pana saved me the hassle of calling the airline. nirandfar.com CUI + You = BFF Amy, the AI bot that booked my lunch meeting, is an example of a CUI that saves time by doing things that a traditional interface of menus and buttons can’t. The proof of Amy’s helpfulness is that, although she’s not human, I can’t help interacting with her as if she were. Amy and the other examples above are just the beginning. In the years to come, CUIs are going to change our lives for the better by treating us like friends. Of course, friends must help each other. Likewise, the service provided by a new technology must be genuinely helpful. As my friend Amir Shevat of Slack told me, “no matter how good the bot or CUI is, it cannot compensate for a shitty service.” But when built well, CUIs can leverage the four steps of a habit-forming product and create bonds between the user and the technology. By designing services that are enjoyable, dependable, and easy to talk to, companies can build products that feel familiar even when we are using them for the first time.

Now AI helps you pick out the right Android app Google gets a human hand to help train machines to classify apps by topics to make it easier for users to search for apps with general queries. By Liam Tung | November 9, 2016 -- 14:59 GMT (06:59 PST) | Topic: Artificial Intelligence The vast number of choices on Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store makes finding the right software a challenge for Android and iOS users, as well as for developers. Image: Getty Images Google has developed a neural network to improve the relevance of app search results on Google Play by predicting topics on the basis of each app's name and description. With well over two million apps each on Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store, app discovery remains a challenge for Android and iOS users, as well as for developers. According to Google, about half of the search queries on the Play Store are general topic searches such as 'horror games' or 'selfie apps'. However, for various reasons search has been hindered on each store. Apple and Google have been working to stamp out efforts by developers to game search on each store in a bid to get seen by users. Apple, for example, recently prevented iOS developers from using long app names and irrelevant descriptions to boost discoverability via search. More recently it launched app search ads to help smaller developers stand out. ​Google Play app downloads explode - but money's still with Apple Google may have pulled away from Apple in app downloads, yet iOS continues to outpace Android in purely cash terms. Read More Google offered a similar ad search for apps product last year and recently changed store rules to stop developers using bogus ratings and fraudulent installs to get discovered. Google's latest effort to improve relevance in app search results on the Play Store relies on a deep neural network with a little help from humans, who like their machine counterparts, also needed some training to classify topics for apps. The main goal of the neural network is to automatically predict which search topics should be linked to an app based purely on the app's name and description. Google needed a system that could apply thousands of topics to millions of apps. Finding vast troves of data to train neural networks rarely seems to be a challenge for Google, but when it came to topics for apps on the Play Store, it actually was. So the company's software engineers needed to develop a neural network that could be trained on a lean data diet. "While for some popular topics such as 'social networking' we had many labeled apps to learn from, the majority of topics had only a handful of examples," Google's software engineers explain. "Our challenge was to learn from a very limited number of training examples and scale to millions of apps across thousands of topics, forcing us to adapt our machine-learning techniques." Google says it overcame the shortage by emulating how humans use app descriptions to quickly categorize apps, including ones they've never seen before. The company used several neural networks that when combined were capable of predicting 'share' if presented with the word 'photo'. The design includes a series of app classifiers that link different topics to each app. While the system sufficed at classifying words around popular topics such as 'social networking', it was less adept at smaller topics like 'selfie'. Human app reviewers added a final layer of training by reporting whether they agreed with the system's output. "To evaluate {app, topic} pairs by human raters, we asked them questions of the form, 'To what extent is topic X related to app Y?'. Multiple raters received the same question and independently selected answers on a rating scale to indicate if the topic was 'important' for the app, 'somewhat related', or completely 'off-topic'," Google's engineers said. However, Google found that raters were disagreeing among themselves over which topics were relevant to an app, so Google ended up training the humans too. "Asking raters to choose an explicit reason for their answer from a curated list further improved reliability. Despite the improvements, we sometimes still have to 'agree to disagree' and currently discard answers where raters fail to reach consensus," they noted. Google doesn't say how effective the system is. However, it is good enough for the company to be using it to guide search and discovery on the app store.

Google Shutting Down Crowdsourced “Map Maker” Editing Tool Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Google Shutting Down Crowdsourced “Map Maker” Editing Tool November 9, 2016 9:37 am EST By Mary Beth Quirk@marybethquirk end of the road Map Maker google maps maps After eight years or so of offering people the chance to edit Google Maps through a tool called Map Maker, the company says it’s going in a different direction, and will be retiring the standalone project in March 2017. However, you’ll still be allowed to contribute to Google Maps, through Google’s Local Guides program, the company announced in an online forum. “This update will enable us to focus on providing the best editing and moderation experience within Google Maps on both desktop and on mobile,” the company said. “We’ll continue to roll out new features to make sure you’re able to do most of the things you’ve grown accustomed to doing in Map Maker – like edit roads – leading up to March 2017 and after.” Map Maker let anyone contribute data to Google Maps, with the idea that humans could supplement the work of Google’s mapping cars. In May 2015 Map Maker hit a snag, however, when someone added an image of an Android bot urinating on the Apple logo. Google shut down Map Maker at that time, but announced in August 2015 that it would be opening the tool back up to users in phases.

This is the malware, unwanted software, phishing, and social engineering prevention techniques Google has with Chrome and search. Google said they are now going to issue repeat offenders notifications via the Google Search Console. Those hit with this repeat offenders notification will NOT be able to submit a reconsideration request for 30 days. Why 30-days? Well, those who keep repeating the same offense do it over and over again because they are able to remove the offense and within days get back in Google and then slap on the malware or whatever right after. Google is looking to discourage that. Google wrote: Once Safe Browsing has determined that a site is a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be unable to request additional reviews via the Search Console for 30 days, and warnings will continue to show to users. When a site is established as a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be notified via email to their registered Search Console email address. @Saijo_George shared a screen shot of this warning in Chrome.

That’s It. Nothing Else. Why Are You Still Reading This Title? Ok, Google. Tell me a joke. Ok, Google. Tell me a joke. Ok, Goog--you get it. by Jessica Lachenal | 8:25 am, November 9th, 2016   I know we keep harping on the same opening, but I truly believe that we do need a laugh or two after that election. Or, as David Chen would have it, fifteen minutes of straight jokes. To test his brand new Google Home device, he asked it to tell him jokes for fifteen minutes straight. This is some extreme edge case QA testing, I have to say, and Chen’s findings are, well… kind of funny. You can see for yourself in the video above, which chronicles his entire endurance test. Oh, and its accompanied by a wonderful view of the Seattle sky and the Space Needle. About halfway through the video, Google Home starts to repeat jokes, as if it’s come to the bottom of its list and it’s starting to really rake in the boos at the Laugh Factory. After a little while longer, it takes longer to pull up a joke. Then, eventually, it crashes, likely deciding that giving up and beginning again is a lot less painful than having to tell the same knock-knock joke yet again. If you’ve got one of these–or if you have any voice command-enabled phone–you should try this out yourself and see what happens. I wonder what Siri would do if it were offered its own Comedy Central special. (via Laughing Squid) Want more stories like this?

By Martin Heller Follow InfoWorld | Nov 9, 2016 4:32 AM PT Like Google, Microsoft has been differentiating its products by adding machine learning features. In the case of Cortana, those features are speech recognition and language parsing. In the case of Bing, speech recognition and language parsing are joined by image recognition. Google’s underlying machine learning technology is TensorFlow. Microsoft’s is the Cognitive Toolkit.  Both TensorFlow and Cognitive Toolkit have been released to open source. Both are complex frameworks that implement many neural network and deep learning algorithms. Both present challenges to developers new to the area. Cognitive Toolkit has recently become easier to install and deploy than it was, thanks to an automatic installation script. Cognitive Toolkit may be a little easier to use than TensorFlow right now, but that is balanced by TensorFlow’s wider applicability.

Listed in its Android Compatibility Definition document, it’s “strongly recommended” devices using USB Type-C for charging should not support proprietary methods that alter the voltage outside of the standard levels. It continues to say that by doing so, there may be operational problems with chargers or devices that use the standard USB Type-C charging system, known as Power Delivery. In other words, one charging system may not work with another, and mixing the two may not be the best idea. Google’s making this a request at the moment, but warns that in the future, it may become a requirement.

As an example, Qualcomm, OnePlus, Oppo, and now Huawei all have their own fast charge technology, which requires the use of a special supplied charger to work. These intelligent chargers often drastically alter the current flow, and make use of special algorithms to streamline the charging process, resulting in faster charge times. Google’s point is these changes may go against the USB Type-C Power Delivery protocol, and if someone mixes and matches chargers, cables, and devices, problems may arise. It doesn’t go into detail about the issues, but at best devices would simply charge slowly, or at worst one of the components may not work, fail or overheat. In the wake of the Galaxy Note 7’s explosive failure, no-one wants to see this happen, and it may have prompted Google’s action. Huawei is the latest company to launch its own fast charging system. Called SuperCharge, it’s part of the new Mate 9 smartphone, and requires the use of a special charger that will zap the battery to 58% capacity in only 30 minutes. Huawei promises the system monitors voltage, current, and temperature to ensure it remains safe. Oppo’s VOOC fast-charge system works in a similar way, as does OnePlus’s Dash charge, and Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology, used by phones including the Galaxy S7 and the LG G5. Exactly how this will affect these charging systems isn’t clear yet, or if USB Type-C Power Delivery compatibility can be engineered into them, to meet Google’s new requirement should it become mandatory.

BUSINESS Technology The world's best gamers may one day compete against the smartest computers Paresh DaveContact Reporter Google cut power usage in its data centers by several percentage points earlier this year by trusting artificially intelligent software originally designed to beat 1980s-era Atari video games. And in the years to come, the Internet giant not only could save much more electricity, but also solve far larger problems by taking on a much more complex video game. Research scientists at Google’s DeepMind unit announced Friday they are developing a computer program that reads data about Blizzard Entertainment’s “StarCraft II” games and learns how to play on its own. The software would have to figure out how to split its attention between micromanagement and long-term strategic decisions. It’s that maneuvering that could deliver big breakthroughs. DeepMind sees endless possibilities to apply development lessons to programs in the energy, healthcare and technology sectors. The Irvine video game company imagines voice-synthesized broadcasters, coaching bots and virtual players that are tailored in strength to their human counterpart. Games could become more intricate and personalized. Along the way, e-sports battles could reach a new level with machine vs. human and machine vs. machine competitions. “I can’t wait to see the day where Google’s AI or someone else’s is playing with the best ‘StarCraft’ players in an e-sports arena,” said Gio Hunt, Blizzard’s executive vice president for corporate operations. “You could absolutely see a world with Google’s AI vs. Facebook’s AI vs. IBM’s AI.” BlizzCon goes all-in on e-sports Jeff Landa Part game conference and part sporting event, the two-day BlizzCon gathering at the Anaheim Convention Center reaffirmed team South Korea as the nation to beat in e-sports, no matter how new the video game.

Part game conference and part sporting event, the two-day BlizzCon gathering at the Anaheim Convention Center reaffirmed team South Korea as the nation to beat in e-sports, no matter how new the video game. The country trounced every other national team to claim the first ever World Cup championship... (Jeff Landa) Video games and artificial intelligence have long gone together. But the computer opponents in video games stick to a script. They look for certain triggers and respond based on written commands. The new wave of AI that Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and many others are pursuing rely on rule-less programs that analyze troves of data to discover the most appropriate response on its own. In the case of video games, it’s similar to how a beginning player would watch tutorial videos on YouTube and study how others play. They also do a ton of practice themselves. Over time, they pick up on what the best tactics are in a given scenario. Looking at a wide spectrum of matches, the computer can determine whether a specific move at a given point increased the chances of winning. “You have an agent and an environment,” DeepMind research scientist Oriol Vinyals said. “The agent observes and acts upon it. There’s several ways to act on an environment, and the agent has to do what’s best.” With 49 Atari games, DeepMind fed data to the computer about what was on the screen during play, including the score. Whether thrown into a boxing ring or a car racing course, the machine took over from there. It usually got close to or exceeded human scores. But Atari games are regarded as simple, with few levers and buttons to control. “StarCraft II” promises to advance the way the programs learn for several reasons. Players in the sci-fi strategy game can’t see the entire playing surface, meaning bots that play the game will function more like the ones that play poker and less like those that have conquered Go and chess. Users have to guess or spy on what their opponents are doing. It’s messy, like typical scenarios in reality. DeepMind wants to limit the AI to what humans would encounter in another way too. The game isn’t as simple as moving pieces around a board. Players must mine resources, deploy soldiers and launch attacks — and the order in which they act matters. The delicate balancing act is something computers don’t do well yet, and DeepMind isn’t going to let its software issue commands any faster than a human could. The intention is to generate new ideas about how to develop the training programs for computers and help them measure the value of different options. For example, in the data centers, Google’s systems might not know what caused a huge power spike — but they can take some guesses and act accordingly. The NFL of e-sports?

To do so, Blizzard Entertainment,... (Paresh Dave) “Ideally, it will translate to a better cooling system,” Vinyals said, noting that power usage control is just one of endless possibilities to bring lessons out of virtual reality. Though DeepMind is spearheading the initial effort on “StarCraft II,” Blizzard Entertainment plans to enable anyone to tap into its systems for similar AI research starting early next year. The public should be able to access replays of online matches as well as the data and inputs needed for bots to compete in games. Blizzard executives said the company is just scratching the surface in terms of making use of its petabytes of data. It’s now in the hunt for someone to be the “database and analytics expert for the company,” according to a job posting. Sigaty noted for example how his team has discussed making statistics from “StarCraft II” matches publicly available for other companies to use in their apps. But it hasn’t made a call on whether to do so. Working with DeepMind is the bridge, he said, to start understanding how machine analysis can make its data “even more impactful.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss LAPD will not help deport immigrants under Trump, nearly 4,000 students from L.A.

Google's parent company cuts back on staff after axing deal to deliver Starbucks using drones Last year, Alphabet announced that the project would launch by 2017 But the firm is now reducing the number of staff working on the project This comes shortly after David Mos, former leader of the project, announced his departure from the firm By Shivali Best For Mailonline Published: 07:50 EST, 9 November 2016 | Updated: 08:11 EST, 9 November 2016 e-mail 10 shares 5 View comments Last year, Alphabet announced that its Project Wing programme, which is working on delivery drones, would be fully launched by 2017. But the semi-secret research project looks like it may be taking a back seat. Alphabet is reducing the number of staff working on Project Wing, which could be the latest sign that the firm is struggling to find the next source of growth outside of its core business at Google. This follows news that the firm has cancelled a tentative partnership with Starbucks, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet is reducing the number of staff working on Project Wing, and could be the latest sign that the firm is struggling to find the next source of growth outside of its core business at Google WHAT IS X?  X is a semi-secret research-and-development facility founded by Google in January 2010. It now operates as a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. The facility works on 'moonshot' projects, including Google's self-driving cars, Google glass, and Google contact lenses.  Project Wing drones were first developed in 2014 by X – the semi-secret research and development facility founded by Alphabet. The project involves specially-designed aircraft that can deliver everything from consumer goods to emergency medicine.  But The Wall Street Journal has now reported that there has been fighting among leaders in Project Wing, leading to some of them being pushed out. Last month David Mos, former leader of the project, announced his departure from the firm. The X division works on several experimental projects, including self-driving cars and Glass wearable computers. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Could robots help voters make better decisions?

Share this article Share Astro Teller, the head of X, recently told The Verge that the Project Wing project had the potential to change the way we buy and share goods. But in the interview he hinted that the project might be facing problems. He said: 'I don't want to minimize the challenges for the Wing project. 'There are a lot of as yet unsolved problems.' According to Bloomberg, Alphabet was also in talks with Starbucks and had tested drone delivery with the coffee-chain.  Project Wing's aircrafts has a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers. But those plans have also been cut over disagreements about access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. Since Google reorganised into Alphabet last year, several of its top executives have left. This includes Tony Fadell, CEO of Nest, and Bill Maris, the head of Google Ventures. Details on the extent of the Project Wing cutbacks have not been revealed yet, but it is a sign that Alphabet is becoming stricter on its projects. WHAT IS PROJECT WING?  Project Wing's aircraft has a wingspan of approximately 1.5m (4.9ft) and have four electrically-driven propellers. The total weight, including the package to be delivered, is approximately 10kg (22lb). The aircraft itself accounts for the bulk of that at 8.5kg (18.7lb). The hybrid 'tail sitter' design has wings for fast forward flight, and rotors for hovering for delivery and vertical take-off and landing. Dual mode operation gives the self-flying vehicle some of the benefits of both planes and helicopters. It can take off or land without a runway, and can hold its position hovering in one spot to gently drop packages. Packages are stored in the drone's 'belly' then dropped on a string before being gently lowered to the ground. At the end of the tether, there's a little bundle of electronics the team call the 'egg,' which detects that the package has hit the ground, detaches from the delivery, and is pulled back up into the body of the vehicle.    Read more: Alphabet Pushes Out Leaders of Drone-Delivery Project - WSJ Delivery drones will mean the end of ownership | Verge 2021 Alphabet Taps Brakes on Drone Project, Nixing Starbucks Partnership - Bloomberg Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Man discovers wife is cheating on him following her with drone Chili's manager snatches veteran's free meal after complaint Obama on Trump: This office has a way of waking you up SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Emotional Chelsea Handler fights back tears over election results 100 special police agents protect suspected paedophile from mob Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing Obama's dig at Clinton over her ground game failures Pres.

As usual the good folks over at iFixit did their thing where they took the device apart to see what makes it tick, and more importantly how easy is it to be repaired. In the case of Google Home, iFixit gave it an impressive score of 8 out of 10. According to iFixit, one of the reasons it scored to high is because there are very few moving parts, meaning that there are less points of failure. Google also relies heavily on standard screws and connectors, meaning that taking it apart is easy as it won’t require any special tools, unlike Apple’s iPhone and the pentalobe screws. iFixit also notes that a good many of the components inside of Google Home are modular and can be replaced individually, meaning that should one component fail, swapping that out for a new one is possible instead of having to replace several at once if they were all connected to each other. In case you’re unfamiliar with Google Home, it is Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo except that it uses Google Assistant. So far the device has been relatively well-received and with a price tag of $129, it isn’t that expensive. Filed in Audio >Gadgets >Home.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Play Store gets Netbanking option in India Software Google Play Store gets Netbanking option in India By Bindu Nair - Nov 9, 2016 Google seems to be rolling out a Netbanking option in its Play Store for Indian consumers going by a new report. The platform has so far only let people pay via credit, debit, and gift cards. The addition of Netbanking should be welcome news to Android users in India. They can now directly buy apps, books or movies on the Play Store via their bank account. Google appears to have tied up with a number of different banks for the endeavor. Google’s move will likely go a long way in encouraging people to buy apps in the country, especially since Android is the dominant player in the smartphone sector in the nation. The brand had previously rolled out a carrier billing scheme in association with Idea to provide another alternative to regular payment options. Also Read: Google Play Store to offer cheaper introductory prices for apps Under the scheme, Idea customers will get charged for apps, movies, books and games directly from their prepaid balance or postpaid bill. The service isn’t completely free though. Buying something worth Rs 10 will result in a Rs 1.50 convenience charge. It’s up to the consumer to decide whether this additional amount is worth the convenience. Android Police reports that the Play Store may also be getting a Trending section for entertainment which focuses on media such as new movies and music, showcasing things like trailers, soundtracks and videos related to the topic. The company may also be looking to change up the entire UI of the platform with fresh color schemes and larger buttons.

Flaws do pop up every now and then as hackers can get pretty creative with how they go about their hacks, but what Microsoft did not appreciate was the fact that Google made it public before they could fix it. The company then announced that they would be fixing it next week, which is this week, and the good news for Windows users is that it looks like the patch has already been made available. According to Microsoft, “This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system.” Microsoft also stated last week that there were hackers who had already taken advantage of the security flaw. This came in the form of a group of Russian hackers who called themselves Strontium, and apparently they conducted some low-volume phishing campaigns as a result of this flaw. In any case your computer should be relatively safe once you have patched it. The patch will also contain fixes for six critical flaws, so if you haven’t done so already, you should probably go ahead and update your Windows computer. Filed in Computers.

The two will meet at the White House at 11am ET, as will (separately) the current and future first ladies, Michelle Obama and Melania Trump. Hillary Clinton looks set to become the second nominee (hi, Al Gore!) to win the popular vote yet lose the electoral college in the past five presidential elections. And Bernie Sanders has issued a statement about Trump’s win: Donald Trump tapped into the anger of a declining middle class that is sick and tired of establishment economics, establishment politics and the establishment media. People are tired of working longer hours for lower wages, of seeing decent paying jobs go to China and other low-wage countries, of billionaires not paying any federal income taxes and of not being able to afford a college education for their kids – all while the rich become very much richer. To the degree that Mr Trump is serious about pursuing policies that improve the lives of working families in this country, I and other progressives are prepared to work with him. To the degree that he pursues racist, sexist, xenophobic and anti-environment policies, we will vigorously oppose him. Thousands of anti-Donald Trump protesters shut down 5th Avenue in front of Trump Tower. Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images Protests in US cities There were peaceful demonstrations on Wednesday night against the Trump victory and the rhetoric employed by the now president-elect during the campaign. Most protesters dispersed in the early hours of Thursday. In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on to Trump International Hotel and Tower on Central Park West. In downtown Chicago, several thousand people marched to that city’s Trump Tower, chanting “Not my president!” and “Our bodies, our choice!”. Thousands of demonstrators were also reported in Boston, heading from Boston Common to the Massachusetts statehouse. Other demonstrations have been taking place in Philadelphia, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, Seattle, Portland and Washington DC, where a crowd massed outside a newly opened Trump hotel and others gathered outside the White House. Smaller marches were reported in St Paul, Minnesota; Richmond, Virginia; Kansas City; Omaha, Nebraska; and Austin, Texas. Globally Asia-Pacific markets staged a huge recovery after an election day wobble, as the region followed the lead of the US and Europe. There has been a rush of interest from Americans in emigrating to New Zealand. In the past 24 hours, the website of Immigration New Zealand (INZ) received 56,300 visits from the US – a huge rise on its daily average of 2,300. And you should know Reports that Donald Trump’s website no longer carries his statement promising a ban on Muslims entering the US are correct – but not as intriguing as they might seem. A glitch discovered by social media users on polling day that allowed anyone to create their own banners on the press releases page was swiftly shut down by Trump techs, but the fix seems to have been taking down the whole page. So: no Muslim ban press release. But no press releases at all. And yes, the Simpsons did predict President Trump. But those widely circulated pictures of cartoon Trump at the presidential podium? Not from 16 years ago, but from last year, after he announced his candidacy. President Donald Trump meets Homer Simpson in 2015. Photograph: Fox Animation Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.56am EST 01:56 As president-elect, Trump will see the daily intelligence briefings that are sent to President Obama. Former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright has been talking to the BBC Today programme about what happens now: It is my hope that when he is given his full intelligence briefings and sits in the Oval Office and listens to people with foreign policy background, then he will understand that statements such as the ones that he made are dangerous for the United States; and that he will see that the world is not a zero-sum world and that we have to, and will need to, cooperate with others. When America talked about America First before, it did not lead to the best results. And so my hope is that he is a smart man and that he will absorb the information when he sees it … The main thing for the president of the United States is to remember that he is president of the United States and that our interests vis a vis what the Russians are doing are very important, and that our friends and allies in central and eastern Europe have been our friends and allies for a very, very long time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.42am EST 01:42 Protests are quietening now, as parts of the US tick over into Thursday. In New York, crowds have pretty much disappeared. The marchers in Chicago have dispersed, with just a small group remaining of the several thousands earlier reported. Demonstrations in Oakland – it’s still not 11pm there – are still going. We’ve had no more reports of arrests. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.18am EST 01:18 A lot will be written about how Trump’s victory represents a backlash of rage from the white working classes, writes Hadley Freeman: Here’s an alternative take: we’ve heard enough of white rage now. Oh sure, listen to the grievances of enraged voters. But understanding them is different from indulging them, and the media and politicians – in the US and UK – have for too long conflated the two, encouraging the white victim narrative and stoking precisely the kind of nasty, race-baiting campaigns that led to Brexit and Trump (as the voter demographics have proved, the linking factor in Trump voters is not class but race). Both campaigns promised to turn the clock back to a time when white men were in the ascendence, and both were fronted by privately educated false prophets such as Nigel Farage and Trump, absurdly privileged buccaneers who style themselves as friends of the working classes while pushing policies that work against them. They have bleached language of meaning, boasting that they aren’t “career politicians” (now a negative thing as opposed to someone who has devoted their life to public service), and they scorn “experts” (who are now apparently the biggest threat to democracy). To call out voters for falling for damagingly racist and sexist messages is viewed by politicians as a vote-killer and dangerously snobby by the media, as though working-class people are precious toddlers who must be humoured and can’t possibly be held responsible for any flawed thinking. There is no doubt the white working classes in the west have suffered in recent decades, yet no other demographic that has endured similarly straitened circumstances is indulged in this way. For decades, American politicians have demonised the black working classes who suffered far worse structural inequalities and for far longer – and Trump continues to do so today.

But here comes a new account for Trump news: @transition2017, which will deliver updates on the transition to a Trump administration. So far it’s just this: The Transition Team (@transition2017) Working together, we will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. Join us at https://t.co/jioPNgivfT November 9, 2016 The account follows one person: @realDonaldTrump. (Not even a look-in for @mike_pence.)

OK, smug radical, if we’re not the answer, let’s hear you list the flourishing leftwing governments, describe how the left bridges its divide? And, of course, they have a point. The style and culture of the radical left is often shaped by university-educated young people (a group that includes me). They are a growing and diverse group; often they hail from modest backgrounds. But their priorities, their rhetoric and their outlook is often radically different to older working-class voters in small town England, France or the US. Both groups are critical to building a victorious electoral coalition, and yet they are, indeed, divided. That must change. Unless the left is rooted in working-class communities – from the diverse boroughs of London to the ex-mill towns of the north – unless it speaks a language that resonates with those it once saw as its natural constituency, shorn of contempt for working-class values or priorities, then it has no political future.

A Japanese foreign ministry official told AFP news agency the two would meet on 17 November, having spoken on the phone for about 20 minutes following Trump’s election win. Abe will travel via New York to Peru for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. AFP reports: On the phone, Abe “talked about the importance of the bilateral relationship and the Japan-US alliance”, which he stressed underpins the peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region, the foreign ministry official said. In response, Trump said he hoped to strengthen the US-Japan relationship further, the official said. Trump also said he appreciated Abe’s economic policy and looked forward to working with him, she said. She declined to elaborate on what else they discussed.

In New York city, several thousand people marched from Union Square to Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue, blocking streets and prompting police to assemble hasty barricades. At least four arrests were made when marchers were moved on to Trump International Hotel and Tower, Trump’s property on Central Park West. In downtown Chicago, several thousand people marched through the Loop to that city’s Trump Tower, chanting “Not my president!” and “Our bodies, our choice!”.

Some people are shrugging their shoulders and going home. Others are marching to another Trump property at Columbus Circle to continue the protest despite the fact that Trump does not, in fact, live there. At Trump International Hotel and Tower, Donald Trump’s property on Central Park West has become a new locus for protesters who have been prevented from joining the protest at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. The building’s guests and residents could be seen observing the several thousand protesters congregated at its base, which the NYPD – either not anticipating protests here, or more concerned with protecting the president-elect’s Fifth Avenue residence – did not cordon off with more than a single cursory barricade. Standing astride a plastic barrier for pedestrians across the street, a young man dressed in black performed a call-and-response monologue, echoed by nearly five dozen protesters standing side-by-side on the wall. “I am a native New Yorker! I have lived here for 32 years! I grew up here! And we are putting you on notice! For your racism! For your fascism! For your heterosexism! And for your classism!” the man shouted, echoed after each sentence by a friend with a bullhorn.

Photo: AFP President Donald Trump. So, you believe the world has changed? Eli Pariser believes the world changed on 4 December 2009. That was the day Google put out a small announcement on its corporate blog. It read: “Personalised search for everyone”. Search would no longer be the same for everyone, wrote Pariser in his 2012 book The Filter Bubble: What the Internet is Hiding. An algorithm would now use 55 signals from you—signals you may not know you were sending, such as your searches, their frequency, your computer’s location—and customize what you find, reinforcing your deepest feelings and excluding, perhaps permanently, things you don’t care about (even if you should). It was no coincidence that personalised search began the year after the launch of the tool that heralded the personalisation of internet technology: the Apple iPhone 3G, which introduced us to apps and the touchscreen. If there were to be a motto for the internet age, it could be: You are what you search for or what you find or who finds you. It’s easier than ever before for those who you may never have heard of to reach you within weeks, days, seconds and help shape or reshape yourself within what Pariser, founder of Avaaz.org, one of the world’s largest galvanizers of social-media opinion, says is the filter bubble. These are the amorphous thought bubbles that wrap around us, as we tap on our cellphones and stare at our screens. “Your filter bubble is the personal universe of information that you live in online— unique and constructed just for you by the array of personalized filters that now power the web,” says Pariser in this interview.(https://www.brainpickings.org/2011/05/12/the-filter-bubble/) “Facebook contributes things to read and friends’ status updates, Google personally tailors your search queries, and Yahoo News and Google News tailor your news. It’s a comfortable place, the filter bubble — by definition, it’s populated by the things that most compel you to click. But it’s also a real problem: the set of things we’re likely to click on (sex, gossip, things that are highly personally relevant) isn’t the same as the set of things we need to know.” Also read: Donald Trump rewrote political playbook in route to becoming US president You care about things in your bubble, things that come at you from your customised social-media feeds: garbage dumped near your house, the flyover being built over your favourite part of the city, the prime minister you idolise, the soldier who died, even the dog being beaten near your house. You may not care as much about what’s outside your bubble, things you may hear of only in passing: police atrocities in Bastar, schools being burnt in Kashmir, millions of children stuck in sweatshops instead of schools. The tyranny of physical distance is irrelevant, what matters is the ping on your phone. You can hide in your bubble, safe behind your screen and no one will know—as the pundits most certainly did not as Trump swept to power. Americans may think there has been no one like Trump, but the 15 years of this century, globally, has clearly been witness to the rise of the strong, previously unknown leader who uses hyperbole, taps into the deepest economic and social fears of majority populations—no matter what the reality is—and knows of the power of the cellphone. As we stream towards them, imbibing their thoughts and changing our opinions, we become part of their bubbles. The unique feature of the rise of the strong leader, the demagogue, whatever you may call him—they are all male—is a phenomenon particularly evident in democracies populated by cellphones: We have watched the rise in this century of Vladimir Putin (Russia), Recep Tayyip Erdogan (Turkey), Rodrigo Duterte (the Phillipines), Victor Orban (Hungary), Narendra Modi (India), the rise across Europe of what was once the fringe, far Right, and of Trump. I would not go so far as to say there is causation, but there is a link, a correlation between the rapid rise of the strong leader and the cellphone. Also read: Lesson from US elections: Humanity needs to catch up to technology Mobile data traffic worldwide rose 4,000 times in the decade to 2015, according to a working paper from Cisco, a networking company. (http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/visual-networking-index-vni/mobile-white-paper-c11-520862.html) If that sounds like a lot, it rose almost 400 million times since 2000. In 2014, for the first time in history, Internet use on the cellphone exceeded the personal computer. This is significant because the PC—not always on and not in our hands—was the main source to access the Internet; today, it is just one of many devices. The cellphone is the leading gateway to the Internet for more than half of all users. In his book, Pariser quotes Marshall McLuhan, the father of modern media theory: “We shape our tools, and thereafter our tools shape us.” We have been shaped by nothing else as clearly as we have been by our cellphones. Over the next four years, cellphone data traffic is projected to grow five times, or a compounded annual growth rate of 53% (https://www.statista.com/statistics/271405/global-mobile-data-traffic-forecast/). Expect our bubbles to grow larger, stronger and produce more leaders like Trump. Samar Halarnkar is editor of Indiaspend.org, a data-driven, public-interest journalism, non-profit organization.

Probably the highest profile vulnerability fixed this month was CVE-2016-7255, a local privilege escalation bug being actively exploited in the wild in concert with Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2016-7855 which has also now been patched. There was controversy surrounding the Google researchers’ disclosure of the former flaw before Microsoft had time to patch it. However, because it was being actively exploited, Google felt it appropriate to shorten its usual 60-day time-to-disclosure window to a week. Trustwave threat intelligence manager, Karl Sigler, agreed with Google’s stance. “Here at Trustwave we have a similar policy. If people are being actively exploited due to buggy code in your software then I think [giving Microsoft] a week before disclosing those details is more than fair,” he explained in a blog post. “Even without a vendor patch, detailed technical guidance can provide work-arounds like software to disable or Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to monitor for.” Elsewhere, MS16-129 is a critical update for Edge fixing 17 bugs, MS16-130 fixes three critical flaws in Windows, MS16-131 patches a critical RCE bug in the Video Control, and MS16-132 does the same for the Microsoft Graphics Component. MS16-133 is rated only as ‘important’ but should also be treated urgently, according to Qualys’ director of vulnerability labs, Amol Sarwate. “Microsoft office bulletin MS16-133 contains fixes for 10 vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to take complete control of the system,” he explained. “In addition to these 10 fixes there is an information disclosure as well as a denial-of-service i.e crash which was fixed. Since office documents are prevalent in typical corporate environment I think this bulletin should be treated as critical even if it is rated as ‘important’.” Why Not Watch? 16 Apr 2015April Patch Update - Sponsored by Qualys 12 Feb 2015February Patch Update - Sponsored by Qualys 14 Jan 2016Securing Your Windows 10 Estate 12 Mar 2015March Patch Update - Sponsored by Qualys Related to This Story Microsoft Patches Four Zero Days in Latest Update Microsoft Unloads Seven Critical Bulletins on Admins Microsoft Targets the Desktop with Nine Security Bulletins Adobe Trumps Microsoft with Patch Avalanche February Patch Tuesday Signals Six Critical Microsoft Bulletins What’s Hot on Infosecurity Magazine?

One of the things I didn’t like about it was its reliance on Windows, but now there’s apparently a Web version. “You might not have known that the folks at Trimble’s SketchUp division have released (earlier this month) an open beta for their new SketchUp in the Cloud version named, my.sketchup. Senior associate editor, Pete Evans, AIA, first became aware of this and brought it to my attention. If you didn’t know either, you are hardly alone. Trimble and the folks at SketchUp have been pretty darn quiet about this release. And it’s not always easy to find news on Trimble’s press release page either.” Russian search engine Yandex has a new algorithm. “The new algorithm is named Palekh, which is the name of a world-famous Russian city that has a firebird on its coat of arms. The firebird has a long tail, and Yandex, the largest Russian search engine, used that as code name for long-tail queries. Long-tail queries are several words entered into the search box, more often seen in voice queries these days. Yandex says about 100 million queries per day fall under the ‘long-tail’ classification within their search engine.” Google really, really wants you to get out and vote. “…The web giant on Sunday launched what is apparently the first in a series of doodles intended to remind you that Election Day is almost at hand. While cute, the doodle also links to information about the measures and candidates on your specific ballot, where you can vote and even how to vote in English and Spanish. When the polls close on Tuesday, Google will integrate real-time US election results into your Google search results in more than 30 languages.” An update to Google’s Transparency Report shows the increased adoption of HTTPS. “Today, we’re adding a new section to the HTTPS Report Card in our Transparency Report that includes data about how HTTPS usage has been increasing over time. More than half of pages loaded and two-thirds of total time spent by Chrome desktop users occur via HTTPS, and we expect these metrics to continue their strong upward trajectory.” USEFUL STUFF Fold3 is making access to its Native American Collection free through November 15th. Materials available include photos, treaties, and census rolls. In case an earworm is driving you bonkers: Top 7 Websites To Find Song Lyrics Online. “Can’t keep up the pace with Eminem’s rap? Or having trouble understanding what Beyoncé is singing? Or are you getting ready for karaoke? In these cases or another, song lyrics become essential for everyone: be it native listener or non-native. Indian listeners with a taste of English music use song lyrics sites to understand the core meaning of the song that they failed to grasp at the very first moment. Not even this, native English speakers widely use lyrics websites for sating their curiosity of the new words uttered by Eminem or Beyoncé.” SECURITY/LEGAL ISSUES Fake apps are showing up in Apple’s App Store just in time for the holidays. “Hundreds of fake retail and product apps have popped up in Apple’s App Store in recent weeks — just in time to deceive holiday shoppers. The counterfeiters have masqueraded as retail chains like Dollar Tree and Foot Locker, big department stores like Dillard’s and Nordstrom, online product bazaars like Zappos.com and Polyvore, and luxury-goods makers like Jimmy Choo, Christian Dior and Salvatore Ferragamo.” France is planning to collect data on all its citizens. “France’s government last week announced the creation of a highly controversial new database that will collect and store personal information on nearly everyone living in the country who holds a French identity card or passport.” Good afternoon, Internet… Do you like ResearchBuzz?

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung's Troubles Continue as they Get Dragged into a Political Scandal Accusing them of Influence-Peddling | Main | Apple's new iPhone 7 rings up Best Selling Smartphone in the U.S. and Great Britain for September » November 09, 2016 Korean Game Rating Committee Notified Google of 157 Games for Kids being too sexually Suggestive, Apple had 3   According to a Korean tech site report, the Game Rating & Administration Committee of South Korea announced yesterday that it had notified Google Korea to change the age ratings of 157 mobile games it distributes last month but Google Korea did so for only 12 out of the 157 that can be considered sexually suggestive.   The report further noted that "The committee looked last month into 552 games that are distributed on mobile app markets such as Google Play, Apple App Store and 'One Store' after the distributors' self-rating. The committee found that 160 of them are problematic in terms of sexual suggestiveness. 157 were found on the Google Play and the other three were on the Apple App Store."   The committee told Apple Korea to re-rate the three games as well but Apple Korea has not carried it out at all. Both Google Korea and Apple Korea are claiming that the difference between their standards and the committee's yardstick be acknowledged.   According to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association, Google is currently enjoying a market share of 75% in the South Korean Android app market with 3.2 trillion won (US$2.86 billion) in sales.   The committee explained that it would compel both Google Korea and Apple Korea to follow the local age rating rules by exercising its own authority within 30 days or face criminal charges.   Considering that Apple only had 3 out of 552 games that carried sexually suggestive material for a younger audience, you have to see this move as pure politics. Clearly Apple's review process is vastly superior to most and should have been singled out with a congratulatory note for the excellent track record instead of being publicly chastised.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments. Those using abusive language or behavior will result in being blacklisted on Disqus.   Side Note: It sounds like the report is suggesting that the remaining 392 games must have been attributed to the 'One Store' which I'm unfamiliar with. If you know who owns the 'One Store' please send the name in the comments section below.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Map Maker is shutting down next year JC Torres - Nov 9, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google is no stranger to controversial products. The Google Glass was criticized for being a privacy nightmare made real and Google’s self-driving cars still continue to be a topic for lawmakers and regulators. As far as web services are concerned, however, it was perhaps Map Maker that garnered the most flak last year, leading to its suspension and very slow return. Well, no more, as Google finally decreed that Map Maker will be no more starting next year. Most functionality will, instead be transferred to Google Maps itself. Google calls it a graduation. We call it a retirement. Map Maker has actually been around for quite a while. But it was only last year that it reached stardom, though not in a good way. Thanks to a prank that showed the Android robot mascot peeing on the Apple logo, Google realized how out of hand Map Maker has been. It shut the service down in May and only resurrected it little by little in August. Map Maker was aimed to basically be like a Wikipedia for Google Maps, allowing anyone and everyone to add markers, correct misinformation, and place annotations that would eventually be seen in the public Google Maps. Like any such open, collaborative platform, it relied on the community to police each other. The system worked for Wikipedia and other such platforms. Not so much for Map Maker. If you loved Map Maker, you’ll be pleased to know that its spirit will live on, and you won’t have to stray away from Google Maps to feel its ghost. The main app, both on desktop and mobile, already has features like adding a place and editing information. It also allows users to moderate such edits. If on the other hand, you fell in love with Map Maker’s collaborative spirit, that also survives, albeit in a different form. Google invites interested users to join its Local Guides program, where actions earn points to unlock rewards. Hopefully, though, we won’t be seeing anymore peeing robots.

  SOFTPEDIA® DESKTOP Windows Games Drivers Mac Linux MOBILE Android APK Phones Tablets WEB Webscripts Web Browsers NEWS Softpedia > News > Microsoft FLASH SALE: Driver Booster 4      40% OFF! Microsoft Finally Fixes Critical Windows Security Flaw Made Public by Google GO Look for MS16-135 to remain protected against this flaw Nov 9, 2016 07:53 GMT  ·  By Bogdan Popa  ·  Share:  Microsoft rolled out this month’s Patch Tuesday fixes only a few hours ago, including an update that addresses the Windows security flaw that search giant Google made public last week. Google discovered an unpatched vulnerability in Windows, and after notifying Microsoft, it decided to make it public, adding that exploits were already spotted in the wild. Google’s security effort has a policy that gives companies 7 days to fix found security flaws, and in the case of Microsoft, the public disclosure was made after 10 days. Microsoft blamed Google for posting details online, explaining that with this decision the company made Windows users vulnerable to attacks, and promised to release a fix on Patch Tuesday. Today, this fix is finally available in the form of MS16-135, an update that, oddly enough, is labeled as important, even though Microsoft itself confirmed that there were attacks launched against this vulnerability. “This security update resolves vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows. The most severe of the vulnerabilities could allow elevation of privilege if an attacker logs on to an affected system and runs a specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerabilities and take control of an affected system,” Microsoft says in the description of the update that’s flagged as a “security update for Windows kernel-mode drivers.” Fancy Bear attacks Microsoft previously said that a Russian hacker group called Strontium, also known as Fancy Bear, attempted to exploit the security flaw, revealing that it recorded low-volume spear phishing attacks specifically aimed at taking advantage of unpatched systems. The firm recommended users to switch to Microsoft Edge, which was already secure against the flaw. “We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure. Google’s decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk,” Microsoft’s Terry Myerson said last week. Users are recommended to prioritize deployment of this update even if it’s labeled as important, and Microsoft explains that a system reboot is required to complete the install. #Microsoft#Windows 10#Patch Tuesday#Google#security flaw subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Gentlemen, Patch Your Windows: Microsoft Releases Critical Security Updates Adobe Flash Player 23.0.0.207 Now Available for Download Microsoft Office Android Apps Suddenly Blocked on Some Chromebooks New Windows 10 Cumulative Updates, Security Patches Coming This Week Apple Insider Says iPhone 6 Plus Has a Major Bug, Company Should Start Recall Hackers Steal FIFA Currency, Buy Houses and Expensive Cars with the Money WhatsApp Announces Video Calling Rolling Out to Android, iOS Users Microsoft Announces Black Friday 2016 Deals: Perfect Time to Go Windows 10 KDE Frameworks 5.28.0 Released with Numerous KWayland Improvements, More NVIDIA Makes Available GeForce Graphics Driver 375.86 - Get It Now Microsoft CEO Meets Chinese Official One Day After Warning on Trump Tax Plan Apple Downplays Microsoft Surface, Says Having Touch on a Desktop Is a Disaster    Microsoft criticized Google for making the flaw public New Apps Viscosity: An efficient and reliable OpenVPN client that provides you with a rich interface for managing multiple virtual private network connections GoodSync2Go: Portable folder backup and synchronization utility that can analyze and compare the content of two directories, find differences and copy files at high speed Mendeley Desktop: Academic reference manager to put together and administer research papers, collaborate with other professors or students, create bibliographies and more Snappy Fax Lite: Send fax messages, forward them to a specified email address or export them with the help of this reliable and user-friendly software solution Audacity: Free and open-source multi-track audio editor and recorder with extensive plugin support for effects, generators, analyzers, and more Lazarus: A full-featured Delphi programming environment that bundles a user-friendly IDE, enabling you to create cross-platform applications Portable Privacy Drive: Protect your sensitive data by creating an encrypted virtual hard disk where to store confidential documents and other private files Reader comments Microsoft Officially Announces Visual Studio for Mac more on: Microsoft i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Over 300,000 Android devices infected with banking Trojan: Kaspersky Labs Over 300,000 Android devices infected with banking Trojan: Kaspersky Labs Modified mobile banking trojan Svpeng found hiding in Google AdSense network accessed through exploit in Google Chrome By: ANI | Woburn | Updated: November 9, 2016 3:27 pm Google Chrome vulnerability exploited by Svpeng Trojan, according to Kaspersky Lab. (Image source: Reuters)  Kaspersky Lab experts recently discovered a modification of the mobile banking Trojan, Svpeng hiding in Google’s advertising network AdSense. Since mid-July, Svpeng has been detected on the Android devices of around 318,000 users, with the rate of infection peaking at 37,000 victims in a day. The attackers, intent on stealing bank card information and personal data such as contacts and call history, were exploiting a bug in Google Chrome for Android. Now that Google has fixed the bug, Kaspersky Lab experts can reveal the full details of the attack. The first known case of a Svpeng attack using the bug in Chrome for Android occurred in mid-July on an online Russian news outlet. During the attack, the Trojan silently downloaded itself onto the Android devices of the website’s visitors. In un-ravelling the attack process, Kaspersky Lab researchers found that the campaign started with an infected advert being placed on Google AdSense. The advert displayed normally on uninfected web pages, with the Trojan only downloading when the user accessed the page via the Chrome browser on an Android device. Svpeng disguised itself as an important browser update or popular application, to convince the user to approve the installation. Once the malware was launched it disappeared from the list of installed apps and asked the user to give it device admin rights. It appeared that the attackers had found a way to bypass some key security features of Google Chrome for Android. Normally, when an APK file is downloaded on a mobile device via an external web link, the browser displays a warning that a potentially dangerous object is being downloaded. In this case, fraudsters found a security flaw that allowed APK files to be downloaded without notifying users. On discovering the bug, Kaspersky Lab immediately reported the issue to Google. The patch will be issued in the nearest Google Chrome for Android update. “The Svpeng case confirms, yet again, the importance of cooperation between companies. We share a common goal to protect users from cyber-attack, and it is vital that we work together to achieve this. We are happy to help make the Android ecosystem safer, and would like to thank Google for its prompt response to our report,” said Malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab, Nikita Buchka. “We also urge users to avoid downloading applications from un-trusted sources and to be cautious when it comes to what permissions they are asked to give and why,” said Nikita Buchka, Malware analyst at Kaspersky Lab,” added Buchka. Kaspersky Lab advises customers to upgrade the Chrome for Android browser to the latest version, install an effective security solution and to be aware of the tools and techniques used by malware authors to trick them into installing malicious software and agreeing to far-reaching device rights. The Svpeng mobile banking Trojan is designed to steal bank card information. It also collects call history, text and multimedia messages, browser bookmarks and contacts. Svpeng mainly attacks Russian-speaking countries, however it has the potential to spread globally. Due to the specific nature of the malware distribution, millions of web-pages globally are at risk, with many of them using AdSense to display adverts.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Google is Splitting its Search Index, Prioritizing Mobile over Desktop Mobile Search  News October 15, 2016 Mobile Search News Matt SouthernOctober 15, 2016 SEJ STAFF 2.4KSHARES 10.7KREADS 2.4KSHARES 10.7KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 2.4KSHARES 10.7KREADS Google is splitting its index of search results into separate versions for mobile and desktop, a change which will happen in the coming months. The split will see Google’s index broken into a rapidly updated mobile version, and a desktop version which will not be updated as frequently. This news was broken by Google’s Gary Illyes at Pubcon in Las Vegas, and again confirmed on Twitter following his keynote. .@methode: Google creating a sep mobile index, which will be it’s primary index. Desktop will be a secondary index,less up to date #Pubcon — Lisa Barone (@LisaBarone) October 13, 2016 Mobile index will be primary & desktop secondary-think about what are the main differences between your mobile & desktop #pubcon @methode pic.twitter.com/umwBoYA6Cx — Eugene Feygin (@rawseo) October 13, 2016 Prioritizing the mobile search index over desktop could be seen as a natural progression in Google’s quest to create a better mobile search experience. It’s fair to say that Google is going mobile-first, which is something the company has long encouraged site owners to do ever since the infamous Mobilegeddon in April 2015. Google splitting its search index is also a sign of the company adapting to the paradigm shift of mobile search overtaking desktop search. Having a separate index for mobile creates an opportunity for Googlebot to strictly crawl the responsive/mobile version of a web page and index it accordingly. This could lead to Google delivering better mobile-optimized content to people searching on smartphones. In addition, with expedited indexing, Google can get breaking news out to users faster than ever before. What Does This Mean for Site Owners and SEOs? With the announcement of an upcoming split of Google’s search index, the company is making an emphatic statement that mobile search is more important than desktop search. Google prioritizing mobile over desktop sends a message that SEOs and site owners should do the same. At the very least, this means having either a mobile or responsive version of your website. However, that’s just the bare minimum. Having a mobile-optimized website is not enough. Speed also matters — not just to Google’s ranking algorithm, but to users as well. According to Google, 53% of users will abandon a site or web page if it doesn’t load within 3 seconds. The best way to optimize your site for speed is to publish content using Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) technology. If you’re not yet on board with AMP, I would recommend regularly checking on your mobile page speed using Google’s testing tool. Keep load times as low as possible. If you regularly publish news about your industry, getting listed in Google News is a must, if you have not already done so. This will not only fast-track the indexing of your content, it will make your content more visible in search results. Ideally, site owners should have these bases covered before Google splits its search index. No exact time frame was given as to when the split will happen, but in this industry, it never hurts to be proactive.

Select Mock Location App It’s no secret that our phones are able to track our location, which some see as an invasion of privacy Smartphone Privacy Settings You Need To Activate Today Smartphone Privacy Settings You Need To Activate Today Smartphones ship with plenty of default settings that could be leaking your info. Let's dive in and tweak them. Read More . But did you know that Android is able to report fake locations instead of real ones? This DO setting actually requires a separate app to be installed to handle mock locations, such as Fake GPS location or Fake gps – fake location.

This is not recommended for those on a limited data plan, but if you experience issues with your phone taking a long time to switch between Wi-Fi and data, it might be worth a try. 7. Disable Absolute Volume Here’s an interesting case of a setting that came directly out of user feedback. Some Bluetooth speakers or devices might have issues working with Android’s volume control. Normally, changing the volume on your phone should change the volume of the Bluetooth device. Some devices don’t work with this feature, or have the volume become extremely quiet or super loud. If you’ve experienced this problem with your devices, try enabling this setting. Otherwise, you should leave it turned off for normal functionality. 8. Show Taps When this option is enabled, a small circle appears on-screen wherever your finger touches. This can be useful in two situations. The first is as an accessibility feature Accessibility on Android: Make Your Device Easier to Use Accessibility on Android: Make Your Device Easier to Use Android includes features to make sure that everyone can enjoy their phone.

Having these circles is also useful if you’re creating a video, as viewers will be able to see exactly where you’re touching. 9. Animation Scales Depending on how fast your phone is, you might not notice them, but Android plays animations when opening or switching between apps. Using the Window animation scale, Transition animation scale, and Animator duration scale, you can adjust how long these transitions take. You can set each of these animations to be double the default speed, anywhere up to ten times as long, or completely off. You’ll probably notice a difference no matter which speed you pick, so if you’d like to make your device feel a bit snappier How To Make Android Faster: What Works, And What Doesn't How To Make Android Faster: What Works, And What Doesn't Everyone wants their devices to run faster and scammers prey on that.

Note that depending on how speedy your device is, these animations might act to mask some hidden loading times when switching between apps, so it might be best to leave them alone if your phone seems sluggish. 10.

Let's run through all the best apps for learning new things! Read More than anything else. When you enable this option, Android will destroy every app’s process as soon as you leave it. Developers can use this to test how their app behaves under different circumstances, and we can use it to see how awful task killers are. Protip for building rock solid Android apps: make yourself dev with "don't keep activities" on. Highlights so many crashes and state bugs — Jarrod Robins (@jarrodrobins) October 5, 2016 Task killers destroy processes running in the background — processes that Android is using to make sure you can switch back to other apps quickly. This ends up forcing your phone to do more work stopping and starting the process than it would if you had just left it alone. Don’t enable this setting unless you really want to experience the awful performance this brings for a few minutes! Developer for a Day There are plenty of other settings in the Developer Options, but most of them don’t have any use for those who aren’t developing Android apps. It’s awesome that Google provides these tools for developers who would otherwise have to jump through a lot of hoops to re-create certain conditions.

The exploit relies on a man-in-the-middle attack of the mobile implementation of the OAuth 2.0 authorization standard. That sounds very technical, but what does it actually mean, and is your data safe? What Is OAuth? OAuth is an open standard used by many websites and apps 3 Essential Security Terms You Need to Understand 3 Essential Security Terms You Need to Understand Confused by encryption? Baffled by OAuth, or petrified by Ransomware? Let's brush up on some of the most commonly used security terms, and exactly what they mean. Read More to allow you to log in to a third-party app or website by using an account from one of the many OAuth providers. Some of the most common and well known examples are Google, Facebook, and Twitter. The Single Sign On (SSO) button allows you to grant access to your account information. When you click the Facebook button, the third-party app or website looks for an access token, granting it access to your Facebook information. If this token isn’t found you will be asked to allow the third-party access to your Facebook account. Once you have authorized this, Facebook receives a message from the third party asking for an access token. Ads by Google Facebook responds with a token, granting the third-party access to the information you specified. For example, you grant access to your basic profile information, and friends list, but not your photos. The third-party receives the token and allows you to login with your Facebook credentials. Then, as long as the token doesn’t expire, it will have access to the information you authorized. This seems like a great system. You have to remember less passwords, and get to easily login and verify your information with an account you already have. The SSO buttons are even more useful on mobile where creating new passwords, where authorizing a new account can be time consuming. What’s the Problem? The most recent OAuth framework — OAuth 2.0 — was released in October 2012, and was not designed for mobile apps. This has led to many app developers having to implement OAuth on their own, without guidance on how it should be done securely. While OAuth on websites uses direct communication between the third-party and SSO provider’s servers, mobile apps do not use this direct communication method. Instead, mobile apps communicate to one another through your device. When using OAuth on a website, Facebook delivers the access token and authentication information directly to the third-party servers. This information can then be validated before logging the user in or accessing any personal data. The researchers found that a large percentage of Android applications were missing this validation. Instead Facebook’s servers send the access token to the Facebook app. The access token would then be delivered to the third-party app. The third-party app would then allow you to login, without verifying with Facebook’s servers that the user information was legitimate. The attacker could login as themselves, triggering the OAuth token request. Once Facebook has authorized the token, they could insert themselves in between Facebook’s servers and the Facebook app. The attacker could then change the user id on the token to the victim’s. The username is usually publicly available information too, so there are very few barriers for the attacker. Once the user ID has been changed — but the authorization still granted — the third-party app will login under the victim’s account. This type of exploit is known as a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack What Is A Man-In-The-Middle Attack? Security Jargon Explained What Is A Man-In-The-Middle Attack? Security Jargon Explained Read More . This is where the attacker is able to intercept and alter data, while the two parties believe they are communicating directly with each other. How Does This Affect You? If an attacker is able to fool an app into believing that he is you, then the hacker gains access to all the information that you store in that service. The researchers created the table shown below which lists some of the information you may expose on different types of apps. Some types of information are less damaging than others. You are less likely to be worried about exposing your news reading history than all your travel plans, or the ability send and receive private messages in your name. It’s a sobering reminder of the types of information we regularly entrust to third-parties — and the consequences of its misuse. Should You Worry? The researchers found that 41.21% of the 600 most popular apps that support SSO on the Google Play Store were vulnerable to the MitM attack. This could potentially leave billions of users around the world exposed to this type of attack. The team conducted their research on Android but they believe that it can be replicated on iOS. This would potentially leave millions of apps on the two largest mobile operating systems vulnerable to this attack. Image Credit: Bloomicon via Shutterstock At the time of writing, there have been no official statements from the internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) who developed the OAuth 2.0 Specifications. The researchers have declined to name the affected apps, so you should exercise caution when using SSO on mobile apps. There is a silver lining. The researchers have already alerted Google and Facebook, and other SSO providers of the exploit. On top of that, they are working alongside the affected third-party developers to fix the problem. What Can You Do Now? While a fix might be on its way, there are a lot of affected apps to be updated. This is likely to take some time, so it might be worth not using SSO for the meantime. Instead, when you register for a new account, make sure you create a strong password 6 Tips For Creating An Unbreakable Password That You Can Remember 6 Tips For Creating An Unbreakable Password That You Can Remember If your passwords are not unique and unbreakable, you might as well open the front door and invite the robbers in for lunch.

By Kristen Tauer on November 9, 2016 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Courtesy Jeremy Scott has been applying his pop-culture touch to the phone case category for several seasons, creating playful cases around each of his recent Moschino collections. Now, Google is tapping into his penchant for linking design with technology by collaborating with Scott on a line of six Live Cases for the Google Pixel phone. The cases, each covered in a different cartoon-print designed by Scott, snap-on and are equipped with Near-field communication technology, which detects the presence of the cases and causes an animated wallpaper app to pop-up on the phone. The cases also give users access to a custom “J’emoji” keyboard with a selection of animated emojis created by Scott. New characters will be added daily, and several will travel as mascots to Scott’s celebrity and model friends for social media promotion of the collaboration. “What’s really exciting about these cases is that the emojis jump off the cases into your screens. I’ve never had the ability to do this before, as the technology is something new from Google,” Scott said. “I was thinking a lot about how the virtual has become reality with our online lives, and avatars are speaking so much more for us than ever in the social media atmosphere that we now inhabit. So when Google came a knockin’ I was ready for them.” The cases, which retail for $40 each, will be available through the Google store for users in the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and Germany starting Nov. 10 through the end of January. Google previously collaborated with Jeff Koons this spring on a Live Case that performed excerpts from “Swan Lake.”   More from WWD.com: The Case for Cases: Dressing Up the iPhone Designers: Apple Vs.

You won't get a better budget blower than the Moto G. Great value,Decent screen,Slick interface PROS: Great value,Decent screen,Slick interface Poor camera,Low internal storage,Extra cost for microSD and 4G CONS: Poor camera,Low internal storage,Extra cost for microSD and 4G Continue reading Update: Time has passed, and Moto's latest line of budget-friendly phones is full of better options than the Moto G (2013).  If you're interested in a good all-around smartphone that won't cost a whole lot, check out the Moto G4.    The Moto G4 Plus amps up the performance and adds a fingerprint sensor to the formula for just a little more cash.    Lastly, the Moto G4 Play retains the essentials in the G4 formula, but slashes the price nearly in half. Sure, it isn't as fast or feature-filled as the G4 or G4 Plus, but it's still a heck of a deal.    The best part about the newer devices is that Android Nougat will be available soon. So, the amount of valid reasons to consider an older Moto G, like this phone, are dwindling quickly.  Original review follows below. Motorola kicked off its global smartphone revival with the keenly priced Moto G handset, which was quickly followed by the 4G enabled Moto G 4G. Both have since been replaced by the larger, 5-inch Moto G (2014) edition, although it will set you back a little more and the bigger screen may not suit everyone's tastes. The first generation Moto G is a mid-range handset with a low-end price tag and Android Lollipop (at least on the 3G version)- enough to pique the interest of many savvy shoppers.. First things first then, the Motorola Moto G price. You can pick the 3G handset up in two storage sizes - 8GB and 16GB. The former will now set you back around £100/$140, while the larger size is still very palatable at around £120/$170. Motorola has enhanced the handset with the new Moto G 4G iteration, which is ever so slightly pricier coming in at around £110 - but does also pack in a microSD slot for some lovely storage expansion. That price is for the 8GB model, as the Moto G 4G doesn't have a 16GB variant. It's difficult to find a first generation Moto G on general sale now though, especially the 3G variant, with most retailers now stocking the newer second gen, 2014 version. So where does this place the Moto G in the market? Well at that price it has the likes of the Sony Xperia M2, Microsoft Lumia 640 and HTC Desire 510 for company and in terms of specs it easily stands up to them. In terms of design both the Moto G and Moto G 4G take most of their cues from the firm's first, post-Google takeover handset, the Moto X. It's hardly groundbreaking in terms of looks, but the soft, curved edges of the Moto G make it relatively attractive and the swath of plastic feels solid and well built. Weighing in at 143g the Moto G has a pleasing, well balanced presence in the hand without being overbearing, and while it may measure 11.6mm thick in the middle the tapered edges make it feel thinner than it is. Couple that with a rubberised rear plate which slightly hugs the side of the handset too, and the Motorola Moto G fits comfortably in the palm, providing a decent level of grip. The Moto G features a water repellent coating which means you'll be able to whip it out in the rain without fear of a short circuit, but it is not waterproof - so no jumping in the bath with it. You can even take the rear cover off and swap it for a different color, which Motorola is pushing as a big customizable feature of the phone. In reality however it just reminds me of my Nokia 3310. Sure, changing covers is fun for all of five minutes, but the novelty soon wears off. Not to mention the back cover is also pretty tricky to remove - you need to really dig your nails in at the base of the handset to get it free. In fact, so much strength needs to be employed to free the cover from the Moto G I feared on more than one occasion that the thin plastic would snap - thankfully it never did. Motorola did make a point that the younger generation like the ability to "customize" their handsets and this particular feature, along with the rock bottom price, reinforces the Moto G's credentials as a handset which may land in the laps of many teenagers. Something worth noting is that because the Moto G and Moto G 4G are identical is design and size you can switch covers between the two variants. The left side of the Motorola Moto G is devoid of any features, while the top of the handset only sports a centralized headphone jack. Both the power/lock key and volume rocker switch are located on the right of the G and these are easy to reach and responsive to the press. On the base is a microUSB port, while under the removable cover the only physical difference between the Moto G 4G and Moto G can be found. Open up the 3G enabled Moto G and you'll spy a microSIM port on the side towards the top of the handset- but no microSD slot. Now take a look at the Moto G 4G, and the microSIM port has changed to a microSD slot, with the new SIM location in the bottom corner of the handset. The 2070mAh non-removable battery housed inside the Moto G is claimed to give you all day battery life, and I put that to the test - skip ahead to the battery life and connectivity section to see how it got on. The Moto G comes with a 4.5-inch, 1280 x 720 display and boasts a 329ppi pixel density. To put that in some perspective that's a bigger, higher resolution and more defined display than the iPhone 5S - not bad for a handset which is a third of the price. Of course a HD display isn't the only key factor in a smartphone, but Motorola has managed to equip the Moto G 4G and G with a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 400 processor and 1GB of RAM. In terms of specs then the Motorola Moto G is actually giving the HTC One Mini, Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and Nokia Lumia 820 a run for their mid-range, dual-core money - and once again the screen is bigger than these rivals. The Motorola handset even beats the Samsung and Nokia when it comes to resolution. The camera on the rear of the Moto G is only 5MP and this is trumped by the S4 Mini and Lumia 820 and their 8MP snappers. All in all the Moto G finds itself in no-mans land, with a complete disconnect between its price and spec list. This, of course, isn't a bad thing and on paper it offers outstanding value for money. The proof however, is in the pudding, so let's see how the Motorola Moto G got on in real life. The Motorola Moto G was one of the first handsets to be updated to Android 4.4.2 KitKat and since then the 3G version of the phone has had a fairly speedy upgrade to Android 5.0 Lollipop - thanks to the manufacturer's close ties with the search giant. The 4G model is still to be updated, but Motorola has revealed that for this model it will be skipping Android 5.0 and jumping straight to Android 5.1. With a 1.2GHz quad-core processor and 1GB of RAM at its heart, the Moto G is more than well equipped enough to run Lollipop which is the smoothest version of Android to date, but if you're on the 4G version running Android KitKat you can expect smooth performance too. Android purists will be pleased to learn that the Moto G and Moto G 4G are running the stock version of Android, with Motorola opting against applying an overlay - claiming instead that it's focused on things which add real benefit to users. These "benefits" include a faster boot up time and improved audio, data management, web speeds and general navigation. I found that the Moto G did boot up impressively quickly, but Motorola's claims that it performs various tasks quicker than the Samsung Galaxy S4 still seem a little far fetched to me. Sure the interface is smooth - impressively so in fact when you consider the price - but I can't say that it noticeably out performs, or even matches the various flagships I've had the pleasure of using. General operation under KitKat is fluid and while it may not be as lightening quick as the top end handsets, the quad-core chip is doing a good job under the hood and I had no issues with lag. You get five homescreens - no more, no less (there's no way to add or remove) - and the familiar Android set up with a selection of widgets available in the tabbed app drawer for you to choose from. Drag and drop an app onto another on any homescreen and the Motorola Moto G will automatically create a folder with both applications inside, allowing you to easily organize and manage your favorite apps. The pull down notification bar at the top of the Moto G's display offers up a feast of information from recent calls, new emails and text messages to Google Now prompts, app updates and third party notifications. Glide a finger over certain notifications, such as a new email alert, and it will expand allowing you to see a longer overview of the message. Slide you finger up from the home key at the base of the screen and you'll launch Google Now, Android's own digital personal assistant and Siri rival. Google Now offers up relevant information in a series of cards, and by tracking your movement, messages and emails it can tailor these cards to suit your needs. You can get information such as the weather, meeting reminders and details on the journey home here. It's still relatively hit and miss and there are far fewer features enabled for those outside of the US, but Google is constantly working on Now and it's slowly becoming more relevant. Tap the multi-tasking key in the bottom navigation bar and you'll be greeted with the familiar stack of thumbnails showing the apps which are currently running. This is testament to the quad-core processor inside the Moto G and Moto G 4G, as the handset can comfortably handle multiple apps at the same time and you're able to switch between them very quickly. Basic applications opened promptly, but I did notice some lag with some of the more demanding games, such as Stick Cricket and Stick Tennis. When these were tapped the Motorola Moto G took a couple of seconds to load up the application. It's not a huge issue and game play is still smooth once you're past the initial load, but it just hints at a potentially small flaw in the low 1.2GHz clock speed of the quad-core chip. The interface is slightly different on the Lollipop-toting 3G handset, with Material Design giving it a new look and fluid animations, as well as improvements to the notifications system, which now prioritises them and places them on the lock screen. The multi-tasking screen has a new look too and there are various other small but handy tweaks and features, like a flashlight option in quick settings. Everything looks bright, crisp and clear on the 4.5-inch display and while the Moto G doesn't match up to the full HD offerings you get on the flagship phones, for a handset with such a low price you'll be more than happy and it puts the competition to shame. There's a thin bezel down each side of the screen, but it's not the slimmest I've seen and I reckon Motorola is pushing its luck a little calling it an "edge-to-edge display." Sure it doesn't feel like there's any unnecessary plastic padding around the screen, but it's not as close cut as on other handsets - the LG G4 springs to mind immediately as a handset with a slimmer bezel. The screen is also very responsive to the touch which makes moving around the Moto G and Moto G 4G a stress-free experience. Contacts As I've mentioned the Motorola Moto G is running stock Android, so there are no surprises in the People app. Contacts are displayed in the standard, alphabetical list format with pictures of your chums to the left - that is if the Moto G can pull them through from your Google contacts and their Google+ pages. A lot of my contacts ended up faceless for the simple fact that they aren't on Google+ and there's no way of linking your buddies up with their Facebook or Twitter profiles - Whatsapp integration is available however. Why? Well it's because Google had a bit of a falling out with some of the main social media players and the join contact integration we see on the likes of Samsung, HTC and even Huawei devices are all the doing of the manufacturers themselves tinkering with the OS. It's not a huge issue, it just means your contact list doesn't look quite as pretty, but it's something I feel Motorola could have included as part of its added benefits for the user - never mind, you can't win them all. What all this means is that your contact cards a relatively bland - there's all the vital information - numbers, emails and the sort - but don't expect any thrills. It's cheap, cheerful and user friendly. As well as your main contact list the People app offers two further tabs at the top of the screen - groups and favorites. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but it makes it easier to find the people you contact most often. Adding a new contact is easy - just tap the central icon in the bar below your contact list and you'll be transported to the data entry screen where you can fill in all manner of details about your new found friend. Calling The Phone app is where you'll be heading if you need to make a call, and as default you'll find it in the app dock on the homescreen of the Motorola Moto G - although you can move it out of here if you prefer. Fire it up and you'll be taken to the phone overview tab which was a new feature in Android KitKat. Here you'll see your more recent calls, most called contacts and your stared buddies for easy call-back ability. Hit the dial pad icon at the base of the screen, start tapping out a number and you'll notice that smart dialing is enabled, with the Moto G offering up various contact suggestions relating to the numbers you've entered. If you want to call someone you've spoken to recently tap the clock icon at the top of the screen and you'll get to the call list. Press the phone icon to the right of a contact and the Moto G will start calling them. Call quality is acceptable, although it was far from crystal clear and the Moto G could do with the addition of HD voice to improve the clarity of voice chat. That said I was still able to hear and understand the person on the other end of the line, and vice versa, so for a budget handset the Moto G and Moto G 4G don't perform badly. I found the Moto G and Moto G 4G was able to keep hold of signal well, even in areas of poor reception and I didn't witness any dropped calls during the review period. The Motorola Moto G and Moto G 4G offer up the usual array of messaging capabilities, but thanks to the inclusion of Android Lollipop/Android 4.4.2 (and Android 4.3 before them) you get not one, but two text messaging clients. There's the stock Messaging application which will be familiar to anyone who has used an Android phone in the past. It's a minimalist, intuitive interface with a list of all your message streams and options at the base of the display to create a new SMS, search your current messages and a basic menu. Profile pictures are pulled through from contact cards which makes the app look a little better - although the lack of Facebook and Twitter integration means you'll still end up with a lot of blank tiles. This is all very well and good, but Google is looking consolidate messaging apps by bringing together SMS and what was known as Google Talk into the Hangouts application. In terms of text messages Hangouts works in a very similar way to the standard Messaging app, albeit with a slightly different look. But mixed up in your text messages are also instant messaging streams, allowing you to talk to more people from a single app. Talking of things coming in twos, you're also treated to two email clients on the Moto G and Moto G 4G, with the Gmail app living alongside the standard Email offering. If you only deal with Google's email setup then you can completely disregard the stock Email app and focus all your efforts on the intuitive Gmail client. From here you can manage multiple Googlemail accounts, with an attractive and colorful interface making it a seamless and pleasing experience. Those of you with other accounts outside of the search giant's remit will have to go to the stock Email app where you'll be able to sign in to all manner of addresses - you can even stick your Gmail accounts in here. There's a unified inbox on offer, allowing you to see all your messages in one place, but you can also filter by account if things start to get a little confusing. HTML emails load in a fully zoomed out view in both apps, allowing you to easily navigate to the area you want without a lot of frantic scrolling. The Moto G and Moto G 4G look set up for the younger generation with a low price and interchangeable covers, so I was a little puzzled when I found Motorola hadn't pre-installed the likes of Facebook and Twitter. It's not a huge issue, as a quick trip to Google Play quickly resolves this, but it is a little frustrating. Although with Google breathing down its neck, perhaps these pre-installs were out of the question for the Moto G and Moto G 4G. In terms of an input method you get the stock Android keyboard, which is a serviceable offering with word prediction and auto-correct, although I'd still recommend downloading a third party option such as SwiftKey if you're planning on doing a lot of typing. The responsive 4.5-inch touchscreen aids typing speed, and provides enough space to ensure the keys are not cramped. Rotating the Motorola Moto G 90 degrees will see the keyboard adjust to the landscape view, giving you larger keys. Chrome is the default browser on the Motorola Moto G, which isn't a huge surprise, and I found that on a strong Wi-Fi connection web pages loaded up in good time. The desktop version of TechRadar managed to render in an impressive five seconds, while the mobile site took just a couple of seconds. There's no 4G connectivity on standard Moto G, so you'll have to settle for 3G data speeds unless you're willing to splash the extra cash on the Moto G 4G. Even over 3G though it was able to load mobile sites in around three seconds, while desktop offerings took less than 10. Moto G 4G performance was more in line with the Wi-Fi speeds. The Moto G comfortably outperforms its price bracket when it comes to surfing the web, and the 4.5-inch display means there's plenty of space to play with. Text is crisp and clear and images are well defined on the 1280 x 720 display, which gives the impression you're using a smartphone which is twice the price of the Moto G. Double tapping on a paragraph of text will see the Moto G zoom in to fit the width of the text to the screen, and thanks to the 4.5-inch display you can read it relatively easily. If you find that the text is still a little small you can zoom in further, but there's no auto text reflow available, which means you'll be scrolling sideways as well as down. Sadly there's no reader mode on offer here and that's probably the one negative mark against Chrome, as along with the lack of text reflow it makes reading long articles a little frustrating. Chrome supports tabbed browsing and you can view the number of open tabs at the top of the page next to the URL bar and quickly jump between them by tapping the icon. This gives you a thumbnail view of each tab, displayed in a series of scrollable cards. The Moto G has no trouble running multiple tabs at the same time. You can also open up incognito tabs which don't track your surfing history, meaning you can visits all those special sites without a trail for your partner to find at a later date. A handy feature within Chrome is the ability to sign into your Google account and have all your bookmarks, and even opened tabs, pulled through from your desktop and vice versa. Bookmarks can be accessed from the Chrome menu and appear as app icons on the screen for easy perusal. While many of the specs on the Moto G and Moto G 4G have exceeded its price, the camera is an area where Motorola has clearly tried to save some money. On the rear of the handset you'll find a 5MP camera and single LED flash, while on the front you get a 1.3MP snapper. Motorola has done some work in the camera app on the Moto G, providing a minimalist interface which sees all the settings hidden from view and the whole screen made into a shutter key. Now I've bemoaned the use of the whole screen as the shutter on other handsets, as the fiddly little app icons could be easily missed, leading to me taking many unwanted snaps. Luckily this issue has been overcome on the Motorola Moto G, as the settings wheel is accessed by sliding your finger from left to right over the display - not once did I accidentally take a picture when trying to tweak options. That might be partly due to the fact I rarely found myself accessing settings, because it's seriously slim pickings. For anyone looking to tinker with various modes, effects and advanced settings such as brightness and white balance the Moto G / Moto G 4G is not the cameraphone for you. All you get are flash, HDR mode, shutter sound and aspect ratio toggles along with a Panorama mode, the ability to attach location information to your snaps and a rudimentary focus & exposure control. If you have plumped for the Motorola Moto G 4G you do get an additional option in the menu wheel, allowing you to save snaps to the microSD card (if you have one inserted) rather than to the internal storage. Shutter speed is pretty swift, but if you fancy a burst mode just hold down on the screen and the Moto G will snap away until you release your finger. There's a 4x digital zoom to boot which is controlled by sliding your finger up and down the display - although picture quality takes a serious battering, so it's best avoided. The full screen trigger makes snapping photos easy as you don't have to aim for a small shutter button on screen, although once you see the results you may wish you never bothered. That budget price tag really rings true here, and I found the majority of my photos were a pixelated mess. The Motorola Moto G struggled to focus properly and even with the focus & exposure setting turned on things didn't improve. The Moto G performed better close up, as it was obvious what to focus on - but when looking at landscapes and situations with a lot going on it just couldn't make up its mind. It's a real shame that the Moto G doesn't have even a slightly better camera offering, but at its rock bottom price point a concession had to be made somewhere, and this is it.

And so they should be, as that 5MP sensor is also responsible for the 720p video capture on the Moto G. Options were sparse for the camera function, and there's even less choice on offer when it comes to video recording. Hit the video recorder icon in the camera app and the Moto G will start recording straight away - no change of mode and no new wheel of settings, just straight into the action. That's great if you're in a hurry to start recording, but it also means you get the same limited settings wheel as the camera app, with some of the features obviously not compatible with the video recorder. One option which is dedicated to filming is slow motion capture, allowing you to add a rather simple, yet pleasing effect to your videos. It's not as impressive as the implementation on the iPhone 6 or even the iPhone 5S, but nether the less it's a nice feature to have. Resulting footage is acceptable when played back on the Moto G's 4.5-inch display, but it doesn't look great when moved to a larger screen such as a computer or TV. While the Moto G disappoints with no expandable memory option allowing you to build on the internal 8GB/16GB of storage, the Motorola Moto G 4G does sport a microSD slot - although it does cost slightly more. If you have the 3G model and want to expand the onboard storage you'll have to take to the cloud. Thankfully Motorola has struck a deal with Google to offer Moto G users an additional 50GB of Google Drive storage on top of the 15GB already provided. If I've done my maths correctly that means you'll get 65GB of cloud storage for free if you pick up a Motorola Moto G, although the additional 50GB is only free for the first two years. It's worth noting that the limited internal storage will fill up fast if you stick lots of videos and music tracks on the Moto G. In fact 2.5GB of storage is taken up by the Android operating system, so if you end up plumping for the 8GB Moto G (or the Moto G 4G which only comes in 8GB) you'll only get 5.5GB of physical storage - that's not great. Music There's just one music app on the Moto G, Google's Play Music offering which fuses your own personal library with the search giant's All Access streaming service. You can get a 30 day free trail of All Access which has millions of songs and radio stations, but once that trail is up it'll cost you £9.99, $9.99, AU$11.99 per month to continue listening. If you're already signed up to another streaming service, such as Spotify, you don't need to bother with All Access, but if you're new to the game then you might want to check it out. For those of you who already have a huge music collection Google will let you upload 50,000 of your tracks to its Play Music cloud service for free, giving you access to all your songs on any Android device. Of course you can always dig out the trusty USB cable and transfer your tracks over the old fashioned way - either way they'll appear in the "My Library" section of the Play Music app. You can browse your songs by title, album, artist and genre with album art pulled through to make things look a little nicer. Tap a song to starting playing it and it will appear in a bar at the bottom of the screen, allowing you to continue browsing your collection. Hit that bar and you'll be taken to the now playing screen where you'll find the usual play/pause, skip and scrub controls along with shuffle and repeat. Sound quality is more than acceptable through a half decent set of headphones, although the built in speaker isn't exactly great with tinny, distorted sound the order of the day - in short, best avoided. FM radio The Moto G comes equipped with a FM radio, which Motorola claims was included to give people free access to music if they didn't fancy signing up to costly streaming services. You'll need to have the headphones plugged in to get reception, and ideally you need to be outside as indoor reception was generally pretty poor. The app is at least easy to use, with the Moto G and Moto G 4G automatically scanning the radio waves for available stations, and you can favorite the ones you listen to the most for easy access. Video There's no dedicated video player app on the Moto G, so if you've transferred your own videos onto the handset, or fancy playing pack something you recorded with the phone you'll need to head to the Gallery. Video clips which you've transferred onto the Moto G / Moto G 4G will reside in a separate folder to your images, but anything you've filmed through the 5MP camera will be bunged into the camera roll, which can make clips a little tricky to find. Tap a video and it will open in a very basic video player - you can play/pause by tapping the middle of the screen and skip through using the scrub bar. That's your lot though. Playback itself is very good thanks to the decently sized 4.5-inch display and the 1280 x 720 resolution and once again its an area where the Moto G can comfortably compete with the likes of the One Mini and Galaxy S4 Mini. The Moto G is comfortable to hold for long periods of time, and it's not too heavy. I would recommend listening to your videos via headphones though, as the speaker on the rear isn't up to much. Google's Play Movies & TV app also resides on the Moto G and if you've purchased films or TV shows from Google Play you'll be able to access them from here. Once again the video player screen is very basic with the same controls as found in the gallery, but at least it's a simple, intuitive app. You can buy or rent movies from Google Play and there's a direct link to the store from the Movies & TV app. Photos Head on over to the Gallery on the Moto G or Moto G 4G to view all your snaps and other images downloaded from the likes of Whatsapp or received via Bluetooth. It's very much standard Android fare here, with the usual thumbnail galleries allowing you to get a good overview of all your snaps. Tap a photo and then select the pencil icon in the bottom corner and you'll be transported into the well stocked photo editor housed with the Moto G. From here you can apply various effects, exposure settings and frames to your snaps as well as crop, rotate, mirror and even straighten any wonky efforts. It's simple to use and there's a decent range of options for you to chose from, although the poor performance of that 5MP camera may be a step too far for this editor. Battery life Motorola claims that the 2070mAh non-removable battery inside the Moto G and Moto G 4G will give you all day battery life, and while I found it's unlikely to see out 24 hours, it's just about able to see through the day. I managed to get a full days use from the Moto G (7am-11pm) and by the time I got into bed the battery meter in the notification bar was red and the handset was in need of an overnight charge. The Moto G had been used pretty heavily, with a couple of hours of music streaming, web surfing, constantly updating email inboxes, some social media activity and a few hours of pretty intense gaming. With more reserved usage the Moto G will comfortably make it to bedtime, last overnight and give you a few hours use in the morning (if you're lucky). If you're planning on staying overnight somewhere you'll still need to take your charger with you to be safe. It's worth keeping an eye on screen brightness, especially when you're watching movies on the Moto G as it can drain the battery somewhat. The good news is there isn't any real difference in battery life performance between the Moto G and Moto G 4G - and I had a Jawbone Up24 and LG G Watch connected to the latter during most of the review period. During the battery test I played a 90 minute Nyan Gareth video on full brightness with all accounts syncing in the background and the 3G enabled Moto G lost 33% of life from a full charge. That's not a terrible result, but if you're planning a bit of a movie marathon you'll want to make sure you're within reach of a charger. If you find yourself getting close to the limit but are nowhere near a charger you can always enable the battery saver which restricts background data activity in an attempt to eek out more life. Connectivity The Moto G comes with all the standard connectivity options you'd expect from a low-end smartphone - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and 3G are all on board. Of course if you go for the Moto G 4G you also get LTE connectivity, plus a handy microSD slot. Pull down the notification bar on the Moto G, tap the icon in the top corner and you'll get a selection of quick settings allowing you to toggle Wi-Fi and Bluetooth quickly. For the other options you'll need to head into the settings menu, where you'll also find the wireless hotspot function. This lets you share your phone's data connection with other devices, such as tablets and laptops. Keep an eye on your data usage though, as this can munch through it in next to no time and you don't want to be lumped with a huge bill. The standard Moto G doesn't have a microSD slot, so more of an importance is placed on the microUSB port on the base of the device as you'll need to plug the Moto G into a computer to transfer over multiple files. NFC is missing from both the Moto G 4G and G, but this is less of an issue as the contactless tech is still yet to take off in a big way. Maps The Moto G and Moto G 4G comes equipped with Google Maps, which has been heavily documented many times before so I'll keep this brief. I tend to find that low-end handsets struggle with the power hungry Maps app, with sluggish load times and fragmented user experience - things are different on the Moto G though. Maps loaded almost instantly, even over 3G, and the Moto G was usually able to pinpoint my location in under a second. The speed was even better on the Moto G 4G with the superfast LTE connection. Zooming and panning around the map is smooth, while the ability to plan routes and start up the free turn by turn navigation makes the Moto G one of the most affordable sat navs on the market. You do need a data connection for navigation to work though, so if you're planning some rural routes it may not be able to direct you if signal drops. Apps Apart from the stock Google applications Motorola has added very little in terms of additional pre-installs, which isn't a bad thing as the swath of bloatware you get on some smartphones (I'm looking at you Samsung) can be overbearing. You can quickly build up a decent app collection on your Moto G thanks to the well stocked Google Play store which offers up a huge range of free and paid-for apps and games as well as movies, music, books and magazines. There are a handful of Motorola's own apps on the Moto G and Moto G 4G, the first of which being Assist. With Assist you can automatically have the Moto G switch itself to silent between certain hours at night so your sleep is not disturbed. Motorola Assist can also go through your calendar appointments and automatically mute itself when you're in meetings - perfect if you have a really embarrassing ringtone. You can select predetermined exceptions, so if someone was to ring you twice with five minutes Assist would allow your Moto G to ring, as the call could well be something very important - or your friend could just be very drunk and feels compelled to tell you that they love you at 4am. While Assist is a nice idea it is rather limited, as Meeting and Sleeping are the only two options, with each offering a limited number of customisable options. I'd have liked to see an option to create your own scenarios and a wealth of exceptions and rules that could be applied - for example a location tracker which knows when you've got to work so automatically turns the Moto G to vibrate and turns on Wi-Fi. Motorola Migrate is the next app in the line up, which aims to make it really easy for you to transfer content from your old phone to your shiny new Moto G or Moto G 4G. You'll need to download the Motorola Migrate app on your old Android handset too, and there's currently no support here for Windows Phone 8, BlackBerry 10 (or BB OS7) or iOS 8. In terms of what Migrate can pull across from your old phone it'll take care of text messages, call history, SIM contacts, media, volume settings and screen brightness. Sure it's a nifty little app and the easy to follow wizard will mean even rookie Android users will be able to follow it - it's just a shame about the limited platform support. Finally there's the Moto Care app, giving you a troubleshooting port of call if your Moto G isn't behaving itself, or you can't work out how to do something. You can search the various help topics, tutorials and FAQs to find your answer, but if that doesn't help there's also the option to start a live chat with a support representative - plus there's an option to call someone too. There's an awful lot to compare the Motorola Moto G and Moto G 4G to, with not just phones in its price range to consider, but also more expensive offerings with a similar spec list. Sony Xperia M2 The Sony Xperia M2 launched at a much higher price than the Moto G, but it's since plummeted to around £125/$190, suddenly making it a competitor. It has a larger but lower resolution 4.8-inch 540 x 960 display and the two phones are tied for power, so it's not looking good for the M2, but it beats out its Moto rival when it comes to battery life and it's arguably the more stylish handset. It also has an 8MP camera, which bests the Moto G on paper, though we weren't huge fans of the quality of the images it took. While it doesn't benefit from stock Android it does have an attractive interface of its own, though it's stuck on Android 4.4 KitKat, so the 3G version of the Moto G trumps it there and we expect the 4G version soon will too. We'd say the Moto G is a better buy in most ways, but if you're charger-shy the longer battery life on the Sony Xperia M2 could make it the smart option. Moto G (2014) Since launching the Moto G Motorola has followed it up with…the Moto G. So to avoid confusion we'll call the new one the Moto G (2014). The main change is the move to a bigger 5.0-inch screen, but that extra size won't suit fans of compact phones and the resolution hasn't changed, so it's not as sharp. The larger screen size also leads to a chunkier frame, leaving it less palm-friendly. It's no more powerful than the Moto G (2013) either but it does have a better 8MP camera on the back and an upgraded 2MP one on the front. Unless you really want a smaller screen the Moto G (2014) is clearly the better phone overall, despite its chunkier design, especially as it's now only marginally more expensive than the older model, starting at around £140/$180. Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini Put the Motorola Moto G up against the Samsung Galaxy S4 Mini and even then it's difficult to pick faults at the cheap handset. In fact the Moto G has a bigger screen than the S4 Mini (4.5 inches over 4.3) and a higher resolution (720 x 1280 versus 540 x 960), plus it's 1.2GHz quad-core processor is on par, if not better than the Samsung's 1.7GHz dual-core offering. The 3G Moto G even runs a newer version of Android - version 5.0 Lollipop - while the Galaxy S4 Mini is still languishing on KitKat. It's not looking good for the considerably more expensive Samsung. Naturally there are areas where the S4 Mini excels and its 8MP camera is a significantly better performer than the 5MP offering on the Moto G. It also brings 4G connectivity to the table, while you'll only get 3G on the Moto G, but considering the low cost of the Motorola you won't be disappointed. On paper both the Moto G and Moto G 4G look like excellent handsets for the price, and in practice they live up to the billing. As the Nexus 4 did with the mid-range market, the Moto G has turned the budget end on its head with features found on handsets double its cost. We liked The whole package. Look at what the Moto G offers, look at its price, and then look at the other handsets which cost the same amount. It exceeds its rivals in several key areas, from the well defined 4.5-inch display to its 1.2GHz quad-core processor and in some cases Android 5.0 Lollipop operating system. There's a lot to love about the Moto G for its price. You could easily be fooled into thinking that the Moto G costs the same as the Galaxy S4 Mini and the One Mini - even web browsing is impressive on the handset. We disliked It's simple. Motorola must have cut some corners to get the price of the Moto G so low, and the camera is one area which has seen the compromise. The 5MP lens is simply not up to the job and my photos either came out blurry, grainy or both, while the camera app itself will be far too basic for some. The lack of expandable memory will be a real bug bear for those who don't want to pay extra for the Moto G 4G, especially if you end up with the 8GB model and it's missing the more recent tech advances in the form of NFC. Verdict Motorola is back folks, it's official. It may not be the return I would have predicted - there's no flagship phone stuffed full of the latest tech - but arguably what the now Google-owned firm has done is even better. The Moto G is a top notch, low cost smartphone and I wholeheartedly recommend this as one of the best budget mobiles currently on the market. I was genuinely impressed with the feature set on the Moto G, so if you're looking for a low cost phone you can stop searching - just go out and grab a Moto G right now. The only difficult decision you have to make is whether or not to spend a little extra cash and plump for the 4G version with its microSD slot - if you like your apps, HD games and video on the go then it's a must - or keep up with the trends and get the larger, 5-inch Moto G (2014). If you're on a tight budget than the original Moto G or G 4G will still suffice, especially now that they're getting upgraded to Android Lollipop. The Moto G 2014 is a step up in price and size while sporting the same screen resolution and a similar design, although it's likely to be a little more future proof and completes the package more with enhanced cameras and additional features.

Reuters/Elijah Nouvelage When Google launched Android Auto, the company was aiming to give new drivers easier access to various pieces of information while on the road. To expand the reach of its already reliable system, the search engine giant is now including a driver interface for all Android devices without the need for a built-in car screen. Google made the announcement on Monday, stating that the company knew there were drivers of older car models -- which were not compatible with Android Auto -- who need or want the system within their reach. As such, Google has created a feature for Android Auto that is compatible with any Android device running on OS 5.0 or higher. The new feature allows these handhelds to project the system directly on the smartphone screen.  READ: Samsung W2017 Android flip phone release date, news & update: Best of specs & features at a hefty price tag The update will allow car users to experience the driver-friendly interface of Android Auto and the several pieces of information it efficiently provides. The interface essentially allows users to access direction, music and communication without the multitude of distractions that are not essential while on the road. Android Auto 2.0 will also provide better hands-free control for users. While Android Devices can now automatically connect via Bluetooth, Google will also be enhancing voice commands in the next couple of weeks. Various applications that deal with music and maps will open with the driver’s “Okay Google.” READ: Sony Xperia X Performance receives Android Nougat 7.0 update; Best time to buy as prices have been slashed As C|Net reports, the update also allows users to access more by allowing users to sort and skip in various applications. For example, users could only initially see and access the first few albums in a music app, but the update will allow individuals to search via the first letters of the albums. The Android Auto update will begin rolling out within the next few days. While it will be available in the 30 countries it currently services, no specifics have been provided. However, signing up at the Android Auto Website will allow Google to send an email once an individual’s handheld is compatible for the update.

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Opinion: From the enthusiast to the general consumer, Apple’s recipe for success has become boring Edoardo Maggio - 2 weeks ago @northead Opinion Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit [First of all, I would like to say that this is but my very own take, which is not necessarily shared by my colleagues here at 9to5Mac and therefore not an editorial, staff-wise opinion piece. It represents my view and my view only, so try to keep that in mind.] Up until not too long ago, I used to ask myself a simple question: if I were to pick one company — and one company alone — to rely on for all of my “tech needs”, which one would I choose? The answer would come rather swiftly: Apple. As a critic (by nature more than profession) I have always seen the vast majority of products skeptically, but that didn’t take from the fact that the Cupertino giant made what I considered to be the best smartphone, the best tablet, the best computers and even two of the most valid operating systems around, accounting for a sweet, unified and well-connected package that would make me feel like I didn’t have to look outside of it. It was Apple’s dream of ecosystem lock-in, essentially. However, as my view of this universe has got more and more panoramic — especially in the last year of collaboration with the sister site 9to5Google, which has helped me a lot to gain even more direct experience with Apple’s competition — I started to have a feeling that this bubble was somewhat bursting. And this feeling is something I simply haven’t been able to shake, and one that has brought me, like apparently many others, to think that the well-oiled profit machine Apple Inc. may have lost some of its touch, for what concerns the present and, more importantly, the future… Apple has long been one of the giants that, thanks to its focus on hardware, managed to surprise and delight me; before I actually got into tech, I fell in love with iPods, which slowly got me into the magical world of Apple products. I remember vividly the day I unboxed my iPhone 5, and just how much ahead of the rest of the tech world that product was bringing me. From its famous introduction to my own unboxing and the first weeks of use, I just couldn’t believe how much I was loving that little thing. Less than a year later I finally caved in and bought a Retina MacBook Pro, the same machine I’m still typing this very piece on, and again couldn’t help but repeatedly fall in love with my gear — and indeed, if you’re reading this piece right now, Apple’s efforts have played a big part in pushing me towards the lucky place I am in at this point in time. One thing I’m sure of, in fact, is that Apple is still incredibly competent and absolutely fantastic at what it does — say what you say about its products or controversial moves, but there likely is no other company on Earth that has the influence of Apple, and I am actually thankful for their choice of taking the reins and doing things such as eliminating old technologies and springing us towards the future, no matter how inconvenient that transition may be. I do understand the users’ complaints — more on that later — but I also try to fit into Apple’s shoes, and there is a case to be made for doing what they’ve done. I do not take issue with that. Again, looking at their lineup, it still strikes me how a relatively focussed — albeit expanding — portfolio of products still makes it possible to produce such incredible pieces of hardware: the iPhone 7 could still easily be considered the best smartphone around, the iPad Pros are great machines, the new MacBooks have a lot going for them, the 5K iMac’s display still makes my mouth water every time I go to a store and look at it, and hell, I absolutely love my little 6th gen. iPod touch. Apple Store in London’s Covent Garden I see more Apple products around than any other brand’s — living in central London surely helps with this, but there’s no denying that the company’s reach is enviable, to say the least — and I am fairly sure that a good chunk of its customers are extremely happy with their Apple-logoed machines. And yet, after all this sweet talking, I feel like I have to address the main issue highlighted in the title. And that is: Apple is boring. And let me get this straight: Apple isn’t just boring by its own standards, but it’s being trumped by other companies too, big time — and often by names you most certainly wouldn’t expect. A few years ago — two and a half, to be exact — at their annual I/O developer conference, Google announced its new, company-wide design system to rethink not just how the design issue should be tackled within tech, but also how we should actually think of it. Material Design was (and still is) an incredibly ambitious, ongoing project, which for the first time put the search giant into that increasingly important conversation. While watching the keynote, I was simply stunned. I was very hyped when, just twelve months prior to that, Apple was to reinvent its software design with iOS 7, and while Ive’s introduction video became what I deem to be his masterpiece (because yes, of course Ive’s voiceovers are a thing) it was quickly turned into nothingness, kneeling before the scale of Google’s ambition. Indeed, Apple had long been a tech design keystone in both hardware (predominantly) and software (more or less), but seeing what Google was aiming at made Apple’s new software approach seem childish to my eyes. And, beware: I say ‘childish’ not because of its execution — an entirely different matter — but rather in its scope. From that moment on I started reading about this upcoming post-mobile “cross war” between the two behemoths: is Google going to become good at design before Apple nails services? Almost 30 months later, I honestly feel like the answer to that question is yes. Material Design is not perfect, and as Google itself reminds us, it is “never done”, but seeing where the company — and all of its products, starting with Android — was just two years ago and where it is now is, in my opinion, nothing short of incredible. Consistency needs to be addressed, but in this short amount of time the Mountain View firm was capable of doing what many would have thought of as impossible, which is linking the words “Google Design” with “gorgeous”. No, seriously, go take a look. On the other hand, Apple’s services have done wonders for the company, but none of them has had a truly identifiable “wow” moment in my mind. Their biggest investment, Apple Music, has proved to be little more than just another music subscription service, and both iOS 8, 9 and 10 as well as the last three iterations of OS X/macOS have done very little to genuinely impress and enchant me. If anything, the one thing I was excited about — 3D Touch — is the one I have experienced less, as my go-to iOS device does not support it. All in all, each version of the two OSs has mostly looked like a game of very small and incremental catch-ups to me, which I’ve come to realize increasingly more as I noticed that my usage of iOS and macOS was not being drastically altered. Which brings me straight to Apple’s stronghold: products. Remember the question I would ask myself all the time? That question’s changed. Now it’s more like: when was the last time that I was actually thrilled by an Apple product? And, much to my own dismay, the answer is “I don’t know”. It could perhaps be the 2015 12” MacBook, which indeed, for all its shortcomings, had something special to it, but even that would be a choice driven by exclusion rather than absolute, buzz-led certainty. Have you noticed that I haven’t mentioned the Watch even once so far? Such is its ‘forgettability’, in my view. It’s a product that hasn’t caught my attention at launch and that I still don’t see much agitation around for, not even from Apple itself. It doesn’t really make the case for a compelling device, much less an essential one; something that Apple had always strived for. Perhaps at fault, but when the original iPad came out I did think “Yes, I need this” — or at least “I want this”. It was bold, and ambitious, and beautiful, and new. It was so very Apple. But that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. It particularly struck me when the iPhone 6s came out: somehow, even weeks after the announcement, my Twitter feed was filled with comments regarding that stupid pink color way more than the decidedly more interesting 3D Touch technology. Did Apple fail to communicate its importance? Or had we all rather become so numb not to actually expect anything from Apple given that it was an “s” model? Honestly, I don’t know. What I do know is that whatever magic used to be there has long been absent outside of Cupertino. You know who’s actually making great products? Microsoft. Yes — the same Microsoft we’ve all laughed at because of Internet Explorer or the buggy, crappy versions of Windows running on that fat, plasticky — and now dusty — black laptop somewhere in the corner of your room. Or, well, not exactly the same company, to be fair. Much like Google, 2014 saw a watershed moment for the Redmond mammoth, with the arrival of Satya Nadella and his more or less complete overhaul of the tore-apart, losing and clueless firm Steve Ballmer had left behind him. And oh boy, how much have they changed. But just for the sake of tying it in with Apple, I will simply recall the moment that has caught my attention the most: the iPad Pro introduction, and Apple’s essential bequest of the “Pro” part to Microsoft. “These guys know productivity,” admitted Schiller last year. And it’s sad to say, but it was one of the most memorable moments of Apple’s keynotes in recent years. After all, which product inspired its very creation? Microsoft has also gotten much more aggressive at Apple’s own hardware game, in fact: look at Surface. They may have not cracked it with the first iterations — or, arguably, yet — but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 are fantastic devices. Bold, ambitious, beautiful and new, dare I say. Rings a bell? And they almost certainly didn’t stop there. Look at the Surface Book: it may, again, not be the “ultimate laptop” Microsoft claims, but it certainly is a far more exciting one than Apple’s latest MacBooks. And yes, you guessed it — the Surface Studio is again a more far-reaching and inspiring product than the iMac. Microsoft, it appears, is making a way better Apple-impression than Apple is. It’s now gotten to the point where Microsoft is seemingly addressing those customers that have long prayed at Apple’s altar, and that the company is now neglecting. The MacBook Pro is actually not a “pro” machine, I hear them say. I read that just about over 100 times in 100 slightly different ways — which is striking, to say the least. And bear in mind that all those complaints come from people who have actually used and loved Apple products likely much more than I have, and whose criticisms therefore have much more weight. But yes, even as a “simpler” Apple customer and lover, this saddens me. And as a more seasoned observer, I struggle to see cohesion: Tim Cook said that the iPad Pro eliminated the need for a PC. “No, really, why would you buy one?” he said. But then Apple has come out with three new Pro laptops, the simpler of which is remarkably closer to the 12” MacBook than to its more powerful peers. And then the Air has been all but forgotten. Then again, you also have the iPad Pro (two, in fact), with too many overlapping features and price points and not enough uniqueness to make me understand what exactly they want to be. Jobs put the iPad clearly in between the iPhone and the Mac; now everything seems blurry, confused. And this is only one practical example. Ironically, Microsoft’s ideas of a ‘tablet that can also be a laptop’ and a ‘laptop that can also be a tablet’ make much more sense, because at least they run the same (great) operating system, and most of all know what they want to be. I’m not saying that they are necessarily better devices — that still largely depends on your preferences and needs — but trying to look at it just from an external perspective, I see the Surface lineup as the clear pinnacle of the current hardware game. Apple may still be a leader, but they sure aren’t the most forward-pushing innovator they were before. There is no doubt that Apple is still a company in great shape and with a lot of good going on for it. I am still faithful that something around the corner may at least bring some of that excitement back. There are so many uncharted territories for them, like VR, AR, AI-trailed products like Amazon’s Echo or Google Home — and then god only knows what else, even leaving the rumored car out of the picture. But as things are right now, I feel like Apple has, at least partially, lost its way. I don’t understand whether the dissonance between its virtually endless (and growing!) customer base and their business decisions has made it so that enthusiasts simply couldn’t be their main target anymore, but recent products — be it because of their price, compromises or just better alternatives from other OEMs — make me question whether even your average Joe is the ideal one. Next year’s major iPhone redesign could indeed bring some much-needed fresh air to the game, and I very much look forward to that — and I still hope that much more is to come. Innovation and competition are the best thing this industry has to offer, and Apple can’t afford to battle only at the box office. So please, Apple: stay hungry, stay foolish.

Apple Inc. sparked the smartphone revolution, but Android spread it to the masses. The software backed by Google parent company Alphabet Inc. powers more than 85 percent of the roughly 1.5 billion new smartphones sold each year. Yet for all its success, Android looks increasingly in danger of falling apart.  That's because the companies that teamed up to make Android a hit -- principally Google and Samsung Electronics Co. -- are increasingly working at cross purposes. Google has just started to sell its first smartphone that competes with its ostensible partner Samsung, and for now it has kept for itself crucial voice-assistant technology that makes the Google phones more appealing than those of other Android manufacturers.  Now Samsung plans to use its own digital assistant for smartphones in competition with Google. Other makers of Android smartphone handsets, principally Chinese firms such as Xiaomi Corp., have also extricated themselves from parts of the Android system. Once successful Google hardware partners, including HTC Corp. and Lenovo Group Ltd., are struggling with their smartphone businesses and are no longer useful Android allies. Coalitions only hold together if all the partners are successful and share common interests. That's no longer a given with Android.  Google started backing Android in the first place because it was worried Apple (and Microsoft, and the phone companies) could find ways to disadvantage or block Google's web search on smartphones. Android was Google's effort to build its own smartphone playground and ensure Google stayed relevant as more computing activities moved from PC web browsers to mobile gadgets. That strategy panned out. But controlling the operating system no longer gives Google a guarantee to siphon and harness all the world's digital information. The more time people spend using Facebook, Snapchat or Siri on their phones -- even on Android phones -- the more data is being generating out of Google's reach. Wresting back some of that power and consumer information is a significant motivation behind Google's efforts to create smartphones that it designs and controls from the chips to the apps. For their part, Samsung and other handset makers know they can no longer rely on Google for their mobile existence. Samsung agreed in October to buy Viv Labs, a startup working on a Siri-like voice technology. In China and India, local companies sell Android smartphones with local versions of app stores in place of Google Play. In some cases, it's possible to use Android smartphones without interacting much with Google. All these moves are signs of the fraying Android coalition. The coalition of the willing isn't willing anymore. It isn't unusual for cracks to emerge in tech alliances. Partners Microsoft, Intel and personal computer manufacturers haven't always been on the same page about the Windows operating system -- a business that mirrors Android in many ways. At times, PC hardware makers felt as if Microsoft was getting the better end of the deal. While Microsoft got rich on Windows software, PC hardware makers were left to fight over single-digit percentage profit margins at best from making and selling Windows computers. In the Android alliance, Google makes the lion's share of the profits, too.  In short, it's hard to stay friends for long in the technology industry, as Google is finding out.  The Windows coalition has held through the turmoil, though Windows never branched far beyond personal computers and computer servers to other devices. The PC is now a fringe of computing, and Windows isn't even the heart of Microsoft anymore. It's not clear how this all shakes out for Android and Google. In contrast to Windows, Android is moving far beyond the smartphone into powering thermostats, web streaming gadgets hooked up to televisions and virtual reality headsets. But if the coalition can't stay together, the big risk is Android turns out to be a crucial technology, but not an enduring one -- the laser disc player of computing.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Please Log In or Register to post comments.

Most Popular The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks, according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves. The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon, plow money into drone delivery. Related Stories Rich Gets Richer: Google Parent Alphabet Reports Higher-Than-Expected Ad Sales Top 10 Company Brand Names: Alphabet Pales Before Google (and Apple) Alphabet Said to Introduce New Stock System for 'Other Bets' Employees "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. Robotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. A Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Similarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer. The status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions. Project Wing, like many efforts inside X, has shifted directions several times. Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Mr. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said. Project Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission -- data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Mr. Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. Then Mr. Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X. Mr. Vos did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on Tuesday. Mr. Teller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Mr. Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and "really dramatically, magically, change the world." However, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received "90-day notices," which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision. Last November, Mr. Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a "commercial business up in running in 2017." It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. "You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery," said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. "Nobody knows how long it's going to take." -- Bloomberg News In this article: Beverages Digital Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2016 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17 x Scroll to Continue

When he opines that Facebook and Google are tech companies whose “business approach is that of a media company” that relies on content, it’s more the reason that one should seriously relook at content creators and business strategies. It’s inevitable that Facebook and Google will get more seriously into content creation, Gotlieb said here, adding that it may not be a very healthy trend considering the power that such companies wield in the digital realm today. Speaking to former CASBAA Chairman Marcel Fenez during the Opening Keynote at CASBAA Convention 2016 here on Tuesday, Gotlieb held forth on varied media industry trends, including holding the view that the AT&T-Time Warner type of mergers (yet to be ratified by US regulator) are “just tip of the iceberg” in vertical integration, which can take interesting turn as FB and Google seriously get down to such M&A activities. To buttress his argument Gotlieb said that Google had already started a division to create content to target consumers, while it may be a matter of time before FB also follows the same path. It’s “kind of “inevitable” that both these companies move into content creation too, which may pose a challenge to other industry stakeholders, the GroupM chief said. Pointing out that both these tech giants were “walled gardens and very protective of the data they have”, Gotlieb, who as the GroupM chief is responsible for generating approximately US$ 100 billion in annual global ad sales, said it may not be a very healthy trend as people need to “see across them to target properly (consumers) to maximise client investments.” “In the absence of big ideas…it (data) allows us to reach and understand the consumer better,” Gotlieb said, adding, while replying to another question, the measurement of TV as “we understand today is understated as there are alternate devices (to consume media)” available with consumers. Holding forth on the changing nature and measurement of viewing behaviors, Gotlieb also touched upon how ways to reach audiences via the marketing funnel is the same but a granularity of data can help decision-making for each stage of the funnel. He underscored how media will continue to play a role and become more targetable, addressable and, eventually, part of the transaction process. Meanwhile, after Gotlieb had set the trend for the opening day of the CASBAA Convention here, Pricewaterhouse Coopers MD Oliver Wilkinson provided statistics to illustrate that pay TV was not dead despite what the headlines screamed and that it remained a primary form of entertainment. Still, with digital players increasingly encroaching on the turf of pay TV, content and channel providers should look to diverse their business models and offerings, Wilkinson said. Doing deals in China was the topic for Bennett Pozil, EVP of East West Bank. He discussed the migration of content both ways as well as some of the pros and cons of doing business in China. Vivek Couto, Executive Director at Singapore-based market research company Media Partners Asia, flagged the rise of digital players with the forecast that pay TV growth would slow to about 3 per cent as content providers were looking to establish more direct to consumer offerings. However, he admitted that in some markets in Asia like India players had invested heavily in traditional TV infrastructure. Reaching a vast audience through tailored video and gaming content was the topic for Chad Gutstein, CEO of Machinima, who highlighted that their most valued content was when viewers felt they had a connection to the creation of it. James Schwab, Co-President of VICE, discussed how their local content policy over digital channels has helped the company grow exponentially over the last few years. The recent move into TV was important for the company as it gave them the ability to invest more in content. Localized and Asian content was flagged by Henry Tan, COO of Astro, for being one of the main drivers that has seen the provider defy the trend of decline in time spent on TV and reporting healthy growth in this respect. A true understanding of the complexities of the Malaysian audience demographic was key to content that worked for Astro’s market, he said. Piracy, online or otherwise, cropped up in conversations throughout the day with opinions polarized on whether this would continue to be an issue. In a session devoted to the subject of content piracy, Avigail Gutman, Programme Director, Operational Security, Cisco, advised that the industry needed to “follow the money” in combating piracy. Lucia Rangel, VP Latin America, Asia Pacific & Worldwide, Game Strategy and Operations, Warner Bros. agreed the problem was global and that `ISD boxes’ formed a critical part of the problem as many consumers were not even aware of the illegality of these and other streaming mechanics. A global effort was needed to fight the pirates, Rangel commented. Desmond Chan, Deputy GM, Legal and International Operations, TVB, highlighted the tangible impact piracy had already made to their business, while Nickhil Jakatdar of Vuclip talked about how the content provider’s strategy was to provide a better experience than that available from pirate outfits. tags GroupM Global Chairman Irwin GotliebCasbaaCASBAA Convention 2016AT&TTime WarnerFacebookGooglePricewaterhouse CoopersMedia Partners AsiaMachinimaAstroCiscoWarner Bros.online piracy.

They recovered from a slightly tentative early session to gain the upper hand, thanks to a beautiful exhibition of Test match batting from Joe Root and Moeen Ali, whose partnership was ended only in slightly unusual circumstances. “There’s no point arguing with it … let’s leave it at that,” says the former of his dismissal in his TV interview just now. India’s quicks looked sharper than their spinners, and with Moeen on 99 and Stokes settling in, England are well placed to put this match beyond the home side. And a day like this probably deserves to end on an email such as this, from Robin Hobbs on booze-smuggling: “The old ‘wine pouch disguised as a colostomy bag’ trick never fails.” If you hold any thought today, hold that one.

They look a bit more tested now, with Yadav jagging an excellent ball past Stokes’s outside-edge with one that reverses away from the left-hander a little, and following it up with a similar delivery that’s shorter and more brutish. The bowler fancies appealing for a catch behind, but no one else does. Though India will be encouraged. Toby Ebbs channels his inner Chris Isaac and bursts into adapted song: “The world was on fire and no one could save me but Root. It’s strange what desire will make foolish people do.

The latter is unlucky not to have a wicket or two for his 28 runs conceded. Speaking of number of runs conceded, Umesh’s increases by four when Moeen pushes the bat out with soft hands and sends it flying behind point for four. You never like to see the bat hanging out but in the end that was well played. He plays the same shot but with extreme prejudice a few balls later and this time the ball positively scorches away to the rope.

The company claimed that Google's disclosure put customers "at potential risk," and was set to issue a patch come this month's Patch Tuesday. Well, Patch Tuesday has arrived, and Microsoft has issued an update that addresses the vulnerability. The security bulletin, rated as 'important', addresses multiple elevation of privilege vulnerabilities including the one exposed by Google last week. The vulnerability in question, which could be triggered via a win32k.sys system call, could allow an attacker to exit Windows 10's sandbox and gain administrator privileges. At the time of disclosure, Google claimed the "particularly serious" vulnerability was being actively exploited and urged users to both update Adobe Flash and Windows 10 as soon as possible. Google revealed details of the vulnerability to the public seven days after privately notifying Microsoft, as per their policy on actively exploited critical vulnerabilities. Patch Tuesday also includes a number of critical security patches that affect all versions of Windows, plus several other important patches and updates for both Internet Explorer and Edge.

Originally unveiled during the company’s annual developers conference this past spring, the app is essentially a streamlined, easy-to-navigate phone interface for when you’re driving. There’s a home screen area with cards showing your currently playing music, weather information, and suggested directions based on your recent search history. You can access a handful of key apps that have been simplified to be safer for use in the car — with big text and buttons. Some of these apps include Spotify, Pandora, and Google Play Music, as well as Google Maps, Android’s Phone app and more. Google says that any of the 500+ apps that have been previously supported in Android Auto will work within this application interface. One that’s notably missing is Google-owned Waze. Also absent at launch is the ability to say "OK Google" to trigger voice control within Android. Currently, you have to tap on the microphone icon to use them or press the voice command button on the steering wheel in some compatible cars, so you can have your text messages read aloud to you and to respond to them using voice. Like similar third party solutions, you can set the app to autolaunch when your phone wirelessly connects to your car’s Bluetooth. Google says Android Auto has shipped on more than 200 car models this year so far, and is available on a multitude of aftermarket display units as well. With large-screen smartphones becoming ever more popular, offering a standalone Android Auto experience makes sense, all you need is need a phone running Android 5.0 Lollipop (or higher) and a car mount. The new Android Auto app is an updated version of the existing app that previously required tethering to a car’s infotainment system. It will be rolling out in the coming days to more than 30 countries where Android Auto is currently available.

VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Google Home not only makes everyday tasks easier, it also allows for relatively straightforward DIY repairs. The teardown experts at iFixit give the smart device an above-average eight out of 10 for repairability, beating rival Amazon Echo, which earned a seven when it debuted in 2014. Unveiled during May's I/O developer conference, Google Home streams video and audio between Cast-enabled gadgets, letting you play music, search the Web, or control smart home devices. Standing 5.62 inches tall and 3.79 inches around, the 1.05-pound Google Home comes in white, with magnetic, swappable bases available in different colors and materials. A high-excursion speaker and micro-USB programming port are hidden underneath. VIEW ALL PHOTOS IN GALLERY Be careful, however, when removing the LED board, which is adhered to the upper case by "oodles of glue" and "seriously serious" adhesive tape, according to iFixit, which used a bit of heat and some isopropyl alcohol to break the barrier. Once inside, a round green grid sparkles with an array of capacitors that make up the speaker's touch-surface controls and 12 status LEDs; another set of capacitors are buried in deeper layer, the team said. On the grid's backside are the 32-bit ARM microcontroller, two LED drivers, and a pair of microphones. The iFixit team removed the stretchy o-ring before prying open the casing, which houses the motherboard and a slew of familiar-looking chips; the CPU, flash, and RAM also made an appearance in last year's Chromecast. //Related Articles Is Google Home Ready for Your Family? Perhaps most intriguing, however, is the mystery cable, sporting four contact points, uncovered in the bottom of the case. IFixit's "totally made up" theories for its use include the possibility that it recognizes the color of the base—carbon, copper, snow, mango, marine, violet, or slate. Better yet, maybe it's a vestigial charging mechanism or an "abandoned Easter egg dungeon level for teardown engineers." Overall, minimal moving parts, standard screws, and modular components means the Google Home is quite easy to repair.

The Home features a removable base - the part that covers the speakers. When you buy a Google Home, it comes with a light gray default base, but you now have the option of swapping this out for something more colorful. Six options are up for grabs in the Google store. Three are made from fabrics, 33% nylon and 67% polyester to be precise. These are called Mango, Marine, and Violet, and you can see them on the left in the image below. The fabrics are covered with a hydrophobic and antimicrobial coating for your hygiene, but also in order for them not to degrade in time because of humidity. The metal options give you a painted steel plate on top of polycarbonate. These are called Carbon, Copper, and Snow, and they can be seen on the right in the image above. The fabric bases each cost $20, while if you want metal you'll need to shell out $40. Via Share Facebook Twitter © 2000-2016 GSMArena.com All brands | Privacy | Terms | Contact us Desktop version

News Alphabet taps brakes on drone project, nixing Starbucks partnership Mark Bergen, (c) 2016, Bloomberg(c) 2016, Bloomberg The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks, according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves. The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we're doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. Robotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. A Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. Similarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer. The status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions. Project Wing, like many efforts inside X, has shifted directions several times. Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said. Project Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission -- data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. Then Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X. Vos did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on Tuesday. Teller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and "really dramatically, magically, change the world." However, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received "90-day notices," which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision. Last November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a "commercial business up in running in 2017." It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. "You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery," said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. "Nobody knows how long it's going to take."

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google’s driving app ‘Android Auto’ now works as free standalone on phones By Ethan Baron / November 8, 2016 at 5:27 PM Google has vastly expanded the reach of its Android Auto software, making it available for use on Android users’ phones, instead of requiring a car equipped with it or an after-market device. Android phone owners with OS 5.0 “Lollipop” or newer operating systems can now download the Auto app for free and use it via their touchscreen. Or they can connect their phone to compatible vehicles and use Auto on the vehicle’s display. The app reportedly drains phone batteries a bit faster than Google Maps, and doesn’t run Google’s popular navigation app Waze. Users cannot yet humiliate themselves by activating voice control with the phrase, “OK Google,” but that’s coming in the next several weeks, Google has said, according to The Verge. To minimize driver distraction, Auto shows only four buttons on the lower screen when the app starts: a home button and buttons for Maps, phone calls and audio. Notification alerts are limited.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home teardown reveals smart home device can be easily repaired By R Padla - November 8, 2016 2 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google has really ventured into the hardware business. Aside from the Pixel phones, there’s the Google Home trying to rival Amazon’s Echo that is powered by Alexa. We’ve shared with you our review last week and noted that it’s feeling right at home with the Google Assistant. The device was earlier spotted in a Walmart store before market release. Google has been busy with marketing and preparation but it already released an update for the Google Cast app which is slowly moving to Google Home. IFIXIT managed to do a teardown treatment of the Google Home and discovered that the device has high reparability. That means it’s easy to repair. The smart home device received a score of 8 on the repairability chart. That’s good news for those who want to “tinker” and”fix” stuff. The only challenge encountered was when the capacitive touch board was a bit difficult to remove. Using the correct tools. IFixit was able to pry open the device and see its guts spread out on the table. The Amazon Echo scored 7 but Google Home exceeded it with 8. This is somehow expected because the Google Home was designed with “modular” in mind. It was also discovered that some of the components of the new Google Home can be found inside the Chromecast.

Update: Android 6 Marshmallow is no longer the latest and greatest in Google's mobile software - Android Nougat is now out in the wild. And, while most high-profile devices have been taken care of, there are still plenty of phones out there that haven't yet received the Android Marshmallow update. So, the question remains: is Marshmallow likely to ever arrive on your device if it hasn't yet? As time marches on, the answer leans more towards "no", but we'll be keeping this guide up to date with any details we hear about new adopters of Google's big 2015 software update. Original article follows below. Android Marshmallow is here. There are battery life improvements, greater app permission controls, standardized support for fingerprint scanners, more granular volume controls, USB-C support and new Google Now features, which are all part of a mix that makes this an exciting upgrade for users. But is your phone actually going to get it? The release process for Android updates is more complicated than Apple's iOS updates, and just because an update has been launched that doesn't necessarily mean you'll have access to it. In fact, you probably won't have Marshmallow yet. So far 18.7% of devices are running Marshmallow - that's not a great adoption rate for Google. It's down to device manufacturers, and in some countries the carriers too, who spend quite a bit of time with the new software before releasing it to their devices. This comes at a time when Google has already released Android Nougat though. Own an Android smartwatch? Read about the Android Wear 2.0 update If you own a Nexus device you're in luck, as not surprisingly Google's new software has landed on those first – and manufacturers like Motorola are generally better at getting updates out quickly. But other manufacturers are a little less predictable. Here are our top Android Marshmallow tips and tricks To make the latest Android update less of a mystery, here's our constantly updated information on when it's likely to land on your phone. Android Nougat release date: when you'll get it and why you'll want it Disclaimer: This article includes information for the rollout of Android Marshmallow software, but depending on region, mobile operator and carrier it can take longer than expected. Google and Nexus At the launch of Android Marshmallow, Google updated its Nexus range of products to the OS. Now, it has rolled out the Android Nougat update to the range, which includes the Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), Nexus 9, Nexus Player, Pixel C and the whole range of Android One devices. Looking back to previous devices, Marshmallow won't be coming to the Nexus 4, Nexus 7 (2012) or Nexus 10. Samsung Samsung did a pretty good job of getting Android Lollipop on to its phones rapidly, but it slowed things down considerably for the Marshmallow launch. That said, almost all of the major handsets now feature the latest software. The Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S5, Galaxy Note Edge and Galaxy Note 4 now have the update in most regions and both the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge launched with Marshmallow pre-installed. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has been updated too in the US, but only on certain networks. Samsung's Galaxy S6 Active and Galaxy A5 is also getting the update to Marshmallow now. The Galaxy S6 Edge+ is getting the update in some markets now as well, but there's no guarantee it'll be on your version yet. Some versions of the Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo are now also receiving Marshmallow across the UK and Europe. There's still no word from Samsung on whether the Galaxy S4 and the Samsung Galaxy Alpha will get the update. Sources claim the Galaxy Note 3 may never see the update to Android 6 as well. As for tablets, the Galaxy Tab S2 is currently receiving the update to Android Marshmallow in both its 9.7 and 8.0-inch sizes, while the Galaxy Note Pro 12.2 is still waiting. If you're on Verizon the Galaxy Tab S will get the software upgrade, but Samsung has confirmed it won't if you're not on that carrier. HTC The HTC 10 launched with Android 6, and the Marshmallow is in the process of rolling out to those who have a One M9 and One M8, One A9, One E9, One E8, One M8 Eye and Desire 826 HTC has also confirmed the Desire 820, HTC Desire 816, One M8s, One M9+, One ME, Butterfly 3 and HTC Desire Eye will get the upgrade, but it's taking quite a long time. Sony Sony has finished updating its phones with the Xperia Z5, Xperia Z5 Compact, Xperia Z5 Premium, Xperia Z4 Tablet, Xperia Z3+, Xperia Z3, Xperia Z3 Compact, Xperia Z2 Tablet, Xperia Z2 all seeing the Android 6 Marshmallow update. The Xperia Z3 Tablet Compact, Xperia M4 Aqua, Xperia C4, Xperia C5 Ultra and the Xperia M5 are now the latest phones to get the upgrade. The Xperia XZ, Xperia X Compact, Xperia X, Xperia XA and Xperia X Performance all come running Android 6 software while the Xperia Z1 and Xperia Z1 Compact will be missing out. LG LG hasn't been clear with its Marshmallow update plans, but the LG G4, LG G4c, LG G3, LG Magna, LG Spirit and LG V10 all have Android 6 software now. The LG G5 launched with the software already installed and we'd expect the LG G Flex 2 might get Marshmallow, but there's no official word yet.

It offers a standard, easy-to-use interface that's compatible with many vehicle systems, but it's the compatibility part that has kept many users without newer cars or expensive aftermarket head units from using the app. That's no longer the case, as Google is rolling out an update that brings Android Auto straight to your phone's screen. Google will be releasing Android Auto 2.0 for any phone running Android 5.0 or newer. The update will allow users to run Android Auto on their phone rather than through an infotainment screen. Simply put, you can run Android Auto in any vehicle, no matter the age, as long as you have an Android 5.0 or newer phone. Even better, if you have a vehicle that has Bluetooth audio, the updated app has a setting to automatically switch to Android Auto when connected. One of the biggest benefits of Android Auto is the way it integrates with the apps you use every day. That means Google Maps, Messenger, Pocket Casts, and hundreds of others are all controllable through the app. While it won't be available at launch, Google stated that it is working on "Ok Google" voice integration so you can control the app without taking your eyes off the road. We at Autoblog are big fans of both Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Both were finalists for our 2016 Technology of the Year award. Apple won out, but we were still very impressed by Google's product. We've been looking forward to this update to Android Auto since it was announced. If it had come out last year, we might have had a different Tech of the Year winner on our hands.

November 15, 2016 Posts Comments Freedom to Tinker Research and expert commentary on digital technologies in public life Privacy: A Personality, Not Property, Right November 7, 2016 by Karen Eltis 2 Comments The European Court of Justice’s decision in Google v. Costeja González appears to compel search engines to remove links to certain impugned search results at the request of individual Europeans (and potentially others beyond Europe’s borders). What is more, Costeja may inadvertently and ironically have the effect of appointing American companies as private censors and arbiters of the European public interest. Google and other private entities are therefore saddled incomprehensibly with the gargantuan task of determining how to “balance the need for transparency with the need to protect people’s identities,” and Costeja’s failure to provide adequate interpretive guidelines further leads to ad hoc approaches by these companies. In addition, transparency and accountability are notoriously difficult to cultivate when balancing delicate constitutional values, such as freedom of expression and privacy. Indeed, even the constitutional courts and policy makers who typically perform this balancing struggle with it—think of the controversy associated with so-called “judicial activism.” The difficulty skyrockets when the balancers are instead inexperienced and reticent corporate actors, who presumably lack the requisite public legitimacy for such matters, especially when dealing with foreign (non-U.S.) nationals. The Costeja decision attempts to paper over the growing divergence between Anglo-American and continental approaches to privacy. Its poor results highlight internal normative contradictions within the continental tradition and illustrate the urgency of re-conceptualizing digital privacy in a more transystemically viable fashion. Informational privacy must ultimately be re-theorized in a manner that would obviate—or at the very least palliate—the need for a stand-alone, ill-defined, and under-theorized “right to be forgotten.” That right is in essence a procedural one predicated on the impracticable idea that individuals “own” data, rather than a right to their identities themselves. It therefore fails to accord with the long-established (continental) tradition of personality rights, which, unlike its common law counterpart, emphasizes personhood not property. In the end, a more robust construction of privacy predicated on protecting identity would allow for a more nuanced balancing of privacy and freedom of expression. Consequently, rather than further expanding an already divisive, property-based procedural “right to be forgotten,” Europeans (and perhaps others as well) would do better to harness the ample protections found in traditional, substantive civil concepts pertaining to privacy—most notably personality rights—so as to develop a coherent set of principles that contextualize identity and the perception of personal (and/or corporate) identity in the digital realm. For unlike the poorly theorized “right to be forgotten,” which unceremoniously imports all the rights traditionally associated with property, the civil tradition offers time-tested, flexible principles for this purpose. Filed Under: Privacy Tagged With: right to be forgotten; comparative law; canada; freedom of expression Comments August Hurtel says: November 7, 2016 at 4:58 pm All rights are property rights. The reason why this ‘right to be forgotten’ is poorly thought out is that after information is broadcast, the information shall now reside on other people’s property- i.e. servers, brains, various devices, etc… Many of these things will be owned by people who are neither the one wanting to be forgotten, nor the party who did the broadcasting. Any attempt to force such a ‘right’ would, in fact, result in the forced violation of many other people’s property rights. But, if we complicate matters by assuming there’s something more than property rights, then people can pretend that it is okay to violate other people’s property rights in favor of this differently derived right. The primary way to defend privacy is to prevent the initial distribution of private information- especially the sort insisted upon by governments.

Point and Shoot Cameras Is the Google Pixel Really the Best Smartphone Camera? Tyler Lacoma November 8, 2016 Shares The Pixel has gotten some great camera ratings, but that's not everything. Google has some interesting news out about its new Pixel phone: It has the best smartphone camera ever! But what does this mean? Is it really better than anything else? Is the Pixel one of the best point and shoot digital cameras now? Well, while the Pixel is certainly making waves, especially among Google fans, the claim about the “best camera ever” needs several caveats. Here’s the real story: The Pixel got a review from the very well respected DXOMark, which examines camera functions in a variety of devices. DXOMark rated the Google phone a score of 89. That’s the highest score that any smartphone has ever gotten. However, this is only one company that has given the Pixel such a high score – it’s not even an aggregate score. And many other reviewers weren’t nearly as impressed with the camera function as DXOMark – so that claim is problematic. The Pixel’s camera has impressive megapixels and software, this is true. However, the camera features remain impressive, no matter where they fall. The rear camera is a 12.3-megapixel monster that works great in low light conditions, has a powerful HDR function, and tons of internal software that separates images into multiple exposures and then combines them again into a single image that’s as clear as the camera can make it (along with 4K video options). It’s impressive, no doubt, and pretty obvious competition for the iPhone 7 models. Also, if you don’t care much about camera model information, note that the Pixel also comes with built-in Google Assistant, 4B of RAM, 32 to 128GB of storage, and a USB Type C port for battery charging. But the biggest feature here remains the camera. Our advice? If you love all the software tricks that smartphones can do with cameras, the Pixel is worth a look. If you’re more hands-on and don’t really care for smartphone pics, there’s nothing new here. Prices start at $649 for preorders if you’ve already made up your mind!

Pyxl Culture Expertise Projects Blog Contact The Blog Back Business Creative Technology Marketing Culture November 8th, 2016 | Bonnie Horner Trending Tuesday: Our Little Google Keeps Growing Up Trending accutane online no prescription Tuesday is back this week with the latest in social and digital news. While you were offline, Google has been busier than ever. Here are some of the top headlines you may have missed over the weekend. New Gmail for iPhone Users Google redesigned their Gmail app for iPhone users with faster search performance, what they’re calling “instant results”. The search feature can also better react to spelling cheap gabapentin suggestions, excellent news for those of us with chubby thumbs. The sleek new design feels less like a mobile website and discount propecia propecia allows users to easily transition between messages by using seamless swiping or scrolling of finger strokes. And if not in more important news, iPhone users now have the ability to canada online pharmacy celecoxib Undo Send from their mobile devices. After an email is sent, users have a brief window of opportunity to take-back the email they just fired off (people everywhere are rejoicing). On a side note, iPhone users will also see an updated Google Calendar view with the ability to check their schedule by month or week in landscape view (shew, that’s a lot of change for one day). Google Makes Mobile a Priority What’s one way to improve mobile search? Google’s decision: Create a search index specifically for mobile websites. As we’ve heard before, Google search algorithms favor mobile optimized websites, and they have made no bones about their effort to push cheap viagra lowest prices index websites to responsive design. They are now cracking the whip and splitting Google search indexes into separate desktop and mobile versions (and prioritizing mobile). This will largely affect websites that have a separate website for desktop and mobile. Why the dramatic shift? The majority of searches happen from a mobile device and Google has continuously tried to improve mobile search. Check! By the way, if you need a responsive website, we can design one for you (shameless plug). Updated Android Auto If taking over the Internet wasn’t enough of a lofty goal, Google updated their Android Auto technology for millions of vehicles. Google’s Android Auto app integrates your mobile apps like Pandora, Spotify and their very own Google Maps with your car. Previously only available in Android Auto compatible cars, this capability is now available in any car, even those without screens. With the new update, Android Auto users can make calls or send messages hands-free and when paired with Bluetooth, users have the option to automatically start the app when driving.

"Government ethics" was the top policy issue discussed in Facebook posts as of 7 p.m. ET, the company said. Abortion and immigration were the top-searched topics on Google, according to Google Trends. Over 7.5 million people shared on Facebook in the U.S. that they had voted. Most penned posts about religion, racial issues, crime and criminal justice and the economy, Facebook data showed. The two major party candidates, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, also battled for mentions on the social media platform. From 12 a.m. ET to 6 p.m. ET, 25 million global tweets were related to #Election2016, Twitter said. Meanwhile, race issues and the economy also dominated Google search, followed by the Affordable Care Act, ISIS, gun control, climate change, the voting system and the national debt. Other highly searched topics were results in key states, including Florida, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio and North Carolina, Google said. On a lighter note, searches for "election drinking game" also spiked, Google said, as did searches for "pray for Trump." Tweet: Some people are starting Election night early: 220 percent spike in searches for election drinking game Tweet: Pray for Trump is 180 percent higher than Pray for Hillary Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted the effect of the election in the companies' recent earnings reports. "We saw record-breaking interest from the YouTube community," Pichai said. "In fact, the three debates rank as the three most-viewed political livestreams of all time on YouTube, with over 8.5 million hours watched live, a 5x increase from the 2012 debates." Zuckerberg estimated that Facebook's "Register to Vote" link helped more than 2 million people sign up to vote, some for the first time. "Facebook really is the new town hall," he said.

In its place, the same editing and suggestion features will be migrated to the main Google Maps app as part of the company’s Local Guides program, which rewards people for policing and improving local mapping data for their community by granting access to beta features and gifting Google Drive storage. Map Maker initially started in 2008 as a way to crowdsource information from rural areas that Google’s own toolset was ill-equipped at obtaining on its own. Over time, the community of Map Maker editors and moderators, who were tasked with overseeing and approving changes made to public data on Google Maps, grew into a group of millions of users. Some of the user behaviors that originated on Map Maker eventually informed new features found in the public version of Google Maps, including the ability to add new places and describe existing locations with more detail. However, the Map Maker community was not without its fair share of bad press. The most high-profile incident occurred last year, when a Map Maker user snuck in an elaborate drawing of the Android robot urinating on an Apple logo. This led to the Map Maker tool being temporarily shut down while Google revamped its moderation practices. Now, by relying on Local Guides’ rewards program instead of allowing anyone and everyone to submit edits, the Maps team may see an uptick in helpful reviews, location edits, and user-generated info. -Via: TechCrunch - Source: Google Product Forums More From The Verge Google will soon ban fake news sites from using its ad network China's right: smartphones are a big reason Trump can't win a trade war Donald Trump is about to control the most powerful surveillance machine in history A Tribe Called Quest’s new album is tear-jerking, essential protest music Watch Dogs 2 is exactly what the original game should have been Predicting Westworld: so it’s Lost Now Trending MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: a touch of the future WhatsApp opens up video calling to everyone This Article has a component height of 5.

(Gary Reyes/Bay Area News Group) By Patrick May | pmay@bayareanewsgroup.com PUBLISHED: November 8, 2016 at 9:20 am | UPDATED: November 8, 2016 at 6:05 pm We’ll update you on the latest breaking buzz from polling places around California and elsewhere this morning and into the afternoon. After that check out our Election Night live blog. Here’s the latest, with all times PST: Related Articles Beyond the White House: Trends that will shape Bay Area races How late can I vote tonight? How to check if your mail-in ballot was counted Election Night live blog: The last cliffhangers 2:13 p.m.: Meanwhile over at Google, analysts are poring over search results throughout the day. As Carl Bialik with FiveThirtyEight explains, Google is “monitoring certain search terms to spot five categories of potential voting trouble: provisional ballots, long lines, inactive voter status, voting-machine problems and voter intimidation. Dots on a U.S. map show places where searches for terms related to any of those categories are spiking. The Electionland project that’s coordinating nationwide journalistic coverage of voting problems is tapping into the Google data for tips on where to investigate.” And over at Electionland, where Google and ProPublica are teaming up, check out the maps borne of all those searches: What does it all mean? “Bursts of blue reflect places where searchers are seeking information about provisional ballots. Arizona, Ohio and California had the highest interest in this topic, three to four times the national average. Splotches of pink mark areas complaining of broken voting machines, the biggest and brightest in Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. ”Search interest about lines peaked at around 7 a.m. in Georgia, soon after polls opened, reaching almost five times the national average. ”Google can also look deeper into state-level data to find localities where search interest in an issue is particularly intense. The city where interest in voter intimidation was highest? Pittsfield Charter Township, Michigan. ”There are 3 billion Google searches on a typical day. Election Day is not typical, this year especially – election-related searches are 500 percent higher than they were for the same period in 2012, Google said.” 1 p.m.: News just in from Nevada where a judge has thrown out Trump’s legal challenge alleging improprieties in early voting around Las Vegas. And then District Judge Gloria Sturman blasted Trump’s lawyers for trying to obtain the names of paid and volunteer poll workers, saying that would expose them to all sorts of abuse from Trump’s supporters online, according to the LA Times: “Do you watch Twitter?” Sturman said. “Have you watched any cable news shows? There are Internet – you know the vernacular – trolls who could get this information and harass people. Why would I order them to make available to you information about people who work at polls? I am not going to issue any order,” Sturman said. “I am not going to do that.” The Trump campaign wants to make names of Nevada poll workers public. Judge's response: pic.twitter.com/tes99IMbbH — Deadspin (@Deadspin) November 8, 2016 (Note: Deadspin, a sports website launched by Gawker, is now owned by Univision) 11 a.m.: From Clinton stronghold Broward County, just north of Miami, election officials say just over 100,000 people had voted by mid-day. With another 622,000 having already cast their ballots in early voting and by mail, that means that all-important Florida’s bluest county reached a 62-percent turnout rate. And that, of course, is hopeful news for Clinton as she’s neck-and-neck with Trump in statewide polls going into the election. They key, says the Miami Herald, is for Clinton  “to drive up Democratic turnout in South Florida counties to wipe out Republican votes for Trump in less populous and more conservative counties in northern Florida.”   10:50 a.m.: In an informal poll among investors who hang out at the Wall Street Oasis forum, Clinton seemed be the favorite choice. A guy nicknamed Dick Fuld kicked things off with this: “I don’t care who you WANT to win, I only care who you think will win and with what degree of confidence you have in your prediction.” And the respondents clearly thought the race was Hillary’s to lose, with everything from 51 to 100 percent surety.   10:45 a.m.: The Trump camp populates the Twittersphere, with son Eric sounding a clarion call for supporters to Just Do It: Initial numbers look great but you have to get out and VOTE! Let's #DrainTheSwamp! https://t.co/27k5n882TU pic.twitter.com/jyMnQsrG3J — Eric Trump (@EricTrump) November 8, 2016 At the same time, Trump is being trashed on Twitter for peeking at his wife’s ballot:   10:39: The folks behind the push to legalize recreational marijuana in California just announced the Yes on Prop. 64 campaign will throw a bash in San Francisco tonight starting 8 p.m.  Another event will take place in LA where backers of the measure will “watch the historic results and celebrate the hard work of its diverse coalition.” On hand in SF will be Prop. 64’s poster child, California Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. That event will take place at VERSO, 1525 Mission Street. 10:22 a.m.: From Politico comes word a few moments ago that Clinton received some good news from middle-of-nowhere New England: “Dixville Notch, the quirky northern New Hampshire town that traditionally votes early on Election Day, has tallied this year’s results — and Hillary Clinton is the local winner. Clinton won four votes, while Donald Trump picked up two. Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson earned one vote, as did former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney, who isn’t running. “The small community — with a registered population of 12 in the 2010 census — is known for its tradition of casting their ballots shortly after midnight on Election Day while gathered in a single ballroom. The tradition dates back to 1960, when the town cast its nine votes for Richard Nixon’s presidential bid.” Over at FiveThirtyEight, that bastion of political analysis, Harry Enten just weighed in with this dispatch from the frontlines: “I just voted in New York, where long lines have plagued many polling stations. That includes the one across the street from my apartment.” At the polling place across the street, there is, to put it mildly, a line out the door… pic.twitter.com/daXtR1L5D4 — (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) November 8, 2016 Also at FiveThirtyAnn, Ulia Azari just reported some strange things going on at some Chicago polling places: “A friend in Chicago reports some pretty disturbing events from the polls this morning. She’s African-American and her husband is white, and they had pretty different experiences at their voting location. She was asked for a photo ID; he wasn’t. She only received part of her ballot at first, and they gave her the other half after she’d already started filling out the first part. Her husband also reported that the only other white voter in line, a man wearing a suit, was invited to cut in line because he was clearly “in a hurry.” (The man declined.) I have no idea if this is representative of what’s happening elsewhere, but it’s not encouraging.” There are plenty of ways to watch tonight’s election results, starting with our own Facebook Live streams. CNN offers a smorgasbord of methods to access tonight’s breaking news: 10 a.m.: From CNN: “Here are *some* of the extraordinary elements of our coverage, and where you can find us beyond CNN TV and CNN.com. We’ll be live streaming … CNN will stream live its broadcast coverage across digital platforms from 4 p.m. ET Election Day to 4 a.m.Wednesday. We are live blogging … As you watch CNN TV on the screen of your choice, linger on our live blog for a dynamic conversation. It’s up starting NOW and will run nonstop for the next 48 hours through to Wednesday afternoon.” 950 a.m.: And that’s just the tip of the online iceberg. Consider checking out these sources, too, from Gizmodo: “NBC News has a livestream of election night coverage on YouTube. PBS Newshour also has a livestream of the election results on YouTube. And C-SPAN has its own stream of the results on YouTube. Twitter partnered with Bloomberg for coverage of the debates, but tonight they’re partnering with Buzzfeed News. Those cheating scamps. You can watch Twitter’s coverage at election.twitter.com or through the Twitter app on Apple TV, Amazon Fire, or Xbox One.” 9:45 a.m.: A cross-voter weighs in: I am a Young Democrat and on this historic #ElectionDay I cast #MyVote2016 for Donald J Trump. And it felt… good. — Democrats for Trump (@YoungDems4Trump) November 8, 2016   9:11 a.m. Trump weighs in early with: ‏@realDonaldTrump 30m30 minutes ago VOTE TODAY! Go to http://vote.gop to find your polling location. We are going to Make America Great Again! #VoteTrump #ElectionDay and posts this video: On MSNBC, an intimate peek inside the Clinton campaign jet: 8:49 a.m.: A Clinton supporter in Atlanta named Christine Maclin, 62, tells the LA Times: “I cannot believe how ugly things had gotten. It made me feel like this country has gone backwards. I could not believe comments I was hearing.” The newspaper is keeping an “This is America’s state of mind on Election day” blog, with short interviews with voters that can be broken down by Californians, non-Californians, Trump and Clinton supporters. Early morning: voters flooding into a polling place in New York City, a harbinger of the crowds and long lines to come throughout the day and throughout the country: Tags:  Elections,  Presidential Election Patrick May Patrick May is an award-winning writer for the Bay Area News Group working with the business desk as a general assignment reporter.

The security feature will now label sites that only temporarily clean up harmful activity as “Repeat Offenders.” Currently, sites in violation of Malware, Unwanted Software, Phishing, and Social Engineering policies will show warnings until Google verifies that the site is no longer harmful. This verification process is either triggered automatically or at the request of sites. However, Google has encountered a “small number of websites” that only temporarily stop harming users to have a successful review and the Safe Browsing warnings lifted. They will then revert back and continue harmful activity. To address this gap in user protection and reduce risk to end users, sites that repeatedly switch between compliant and policy-violating behavior within a “short window of time” will be labeled as Repeat Offenders. Once a site has received the label, site owners will be contacted and unable to request additional reviews for 30 days. Websites that are hacked will not be classified as Repeat Offenders; only those that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the new policy. Late last year, Safe Browsing was expanded to Chrome for Android and in September to third-party apps through Google Play services. Additionally, it was extended to Gmail on the web and protects against nefarious links this year.

It has been in science fiction books and movies for quite some time. The concept of a driverless car is neither new nor all that difficult to imagine; it has been around in science fiction for quite some time.  One particularly clear implementation of the idea was in Minority Report, a movie set in the future and released in 2002.  But in the actual world, it took a more practical shape starting early this decade when Google announced that it was working on a driverless car that would be able to navigate cities, full of their usual hustle-bustle, with ease. Now in 2016, almost every company that has anything to do with commuting and cars is working on a driverless car.  Google, being an early pioneer in the field, is giving final touches to its cute and cuddly small car that neither has brakes that a person can control nor the steering wheel. Then there is Uber, one of the biggest cab aggregators in the world.  It has partnered with Ford and has modified the Fiestas, which it now is using as driverless cabs as a sort of trial run in Pittsburgh, the US. But these are not the only companies eyeing driverless cars.  All big car companies, including Volvo and Mercedes, are working on cars that can drive themselves. Even a company like LeEco, a China-based technology company, has partnered with Faraday Future to create a driverless car, which it hopes to unveil within a few months from now in the early next year.  Then there is Tesla, a US-based electrical car company led by billionaire Elon Musk. The company is already selling cars that have the auto pilot feature, which allows drivers to leave the control of the vehicle on a highway when it is cruising.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next TECH A LOOK: From RAM to Anti-Virus Apps... the biggest... 'India is doing ok... but it'll never be China': Top asset... Share this article Share In the auto mode, a Tesla Model S or a Model X, follow the cars ahead of them at a safe distance and at a required speed.  And although many have criticised Tesla’s auto pilot as dangerous, the company maintains that it is semiautonomous for now with the fully driverless feature to be enabled in future with a software update in the existing cars.  All driverless cars, whether they are running on the roads of Singapore or trying to push to their limits in a test lab, use more or less the same technology. They have sensors and cameras, which allows them to collect data from around them.  The most important of these sensors is the ladar a.k.a. laserbased radar. This data is then analysed using billions of calculations every second, which in turn determines how the car behaves.  “We’ve taught our cars to navigate through many complicated scenarios on city streets,” notes Google.  “Our cars use their sensors and software to sense objects like pedestrians, cyclists, vehicles and more, and are designed to safely drive around them."  After years of research, the technology behind driverless cars has become standardised. But the laws are yet to catch up to it.  The big questions of ethics and civility around the driverless cars remain unsolved.  In case of an impending accident, should the computer work to save the occupant of the car or the pedestrians? That is a question far more complex than it seems.  And that is just one question. It is also a question that governments across the world are pondering. Last month, US president Barack Obama wrote in an op-ed that “in the sevenand- a-half years of my presidency, self-driving cars have gone from sci-fi fantasy to an emerging reality” but they need rules before they can hit Share or comment on this article e-mail Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search     DON'T MISS Slimline Khloe Kardashian sparks concern among fans as she shows off her TINY waist in latest sexy selfie Looked thinner than ever 'That's brutal, smart-a**e': Little Mix's Jade Thirlwall and Perrie Edwards lose their cool as they're asked about Jesy Nelson's missing engagement ring 'I knew she was "The One" after we had sex': Ryan Reynolds speaks about 'cliché' romance with wife Blake ... as he hints they slept together on their first date Have April Love Geary, 21, and Robin Thicke, 39, got married?

TechRadar pro IT insights for business Search RSS News Reviews Insights TechRadar Business Laptop/PC Printers Hardware Software Mobile working Security Networks Management Data centre & Cloud News Microsoft patches nasty Windows 10 security flaw outed by Google Microsoft patches nasty Windows 10 security flaw outed by Google By Joe Osborne Security software   As promised, but not before hackers took advantage Shares On October 31, Google publicly outed Microsoft for a critical zero-day security flaw in Windows 10 just 10 days after reporting the vulnerability to the firm. Today, as promised in a subsequent (and angry) blog post, Microsoft has patched up the hole and more in a round of updates. The issue was said to allow hackers to easily work around the operating system’s (OS) security sandbox, letting them to execute harmful code, delete data and create user accounts with full access to the OS and "take control of an affected system,” Microsoft wrote in a security bulletin following its usual patch day. In order to exploit the security hole, however, the end user would have to be tricked into opening an app created specifically for this purpose and remain logged in for the hacker to do any real damage. Back on November 1, Microsoft even claimed in that blog post that the flaw was not exploitable if you were running the then-latest version of its new OS. See why you should still consider buying a Surface Pro 3  How long is long enough? Last week, Google justified publicizing the so-called Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability early in citing evidence that the flaw was already being exploited by hackers. Normally, Google gives fellow firms three months to sort their security issues before making them public. Citing the urgent nature of this particular security flaw, Google broke that rule rather quickly. This caused Microsoft executive Terry Myerson to lash out a bit at the search giant in the aforementioned blog post, claiming that its move only put more of its users at risk, though recognized the Google researcher’s hard work. Protect yourself with one of 2016’s best security suites While Google took matters into its own hands for the sake of the public, it’s obvious that the two companies are rivals in several respects – namely in that both are fervently competing for market share in regards to their operating systems. Outside looking in, it’s impossible to say whether one party drug its feet in delivering a fix or the other had ulterior motives in disclosing the flaw publicly. Regardless, it’s important to recognize the environment and circumstances surrounding both in this exchange. To ensure that you’re protected from the flaw, make sure to update your version of Windows 10 today. Oh, and give your system a quick malware scan for good measure.

Mark Bergen @mhbergen More stories by Mark Bergen November 8, 2016 — 3:31 PM EST A Project Wing prototype during a test flight. Source: Project Wing, Alphabet iNc. The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet Inc.  Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks Corp., according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified speaking about private company moves.  The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." QuickTake Read More: Domesticating Drones In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. Robotic burrito drop-offs are a far cry from Google's initial aims. The unit first wanted to deploy drones to deliver health-care items, such as medicine and heart defibrillators. After those plans were scrapped, the unit moved to food and other perishables. Alphabet was in advanced talks with Starbucks and had tested delivery with the coffee-chain operator, according to two people familiar with the plans. Those plans were nixed, largely over disagreements about the access to customer data that Alphabet wanted, according to a former X employee. A Starbucks representative didn't respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.  Similarly, the unit was in talks to provide suburban grocery delivery in Ireland, where drone rules are less stringent than in the U.S. Amazon's Prime Air service, a competing effort to use unmanned vehicles, announced it was testing with the British government this summer.  The status of Project Wing's effort in Ireland is unclear. An X spokeswoman declined to comment on those talks, as well as the Starbucks partnership and hiring decisions.  Course Correction Exclusive insights in your inbox, from our technology reporters around the world.

Early on, under the leadership of Massachusetts Institute of Technology roboticist Nicholas Roy, it operated like an academic research project, according to former employees. Vos, who joined Google in 2014, steered a different course. The aerospace veteran increased simulation testing for the drones and implemented a new product review system that reflected standards in the aviation industry, which are more rigorous than software testing, the former employees said.  Project Wing also hinted at aspirations aligned to Google's mission -- data collection along with delivery logistics. Last year, Vos detailed Project Wing's ambition to run an air-traffic control hub for a drone-based economy. He described plans to equip drones with radio transponders that communicate with controllers and other aircraft by 2020. Then Vos suddenly left. Alphabet did not name a successor. The project now reports to Astro Teller, the longtime chief of X. Vos did not immediately respond to e-mails seeking comment on Tuesday. Teller is still making bold predictions for the technology. In an interview published on Tuesday with The Verge, Teller said the drone program could spell the end of an ownership society and "really dramatically, magically, change the world." However, the drone team is now undergoing similar financial scrutiny as other Alphabet experimental arms, such as its Google Fiber and robotics units. Several Project Wing employees have received "90-day notices," which are requests to find different jobs inside Alphabet before being terminated, according to one person familiar with the decision.  Last November, Vos told an aviation conference that Project Wing planned to have a "commercial business up in running in 2017." It is unclear if his exit and the staff changes will delay that timeline. Some in the nascent industry are skeptical that any company can move beyond test sites in the U.S. in the next one or two years, given Federal Aviation Administration restrictions. "You're not even allowed to ask for a waiver to fly beyond the visual line of sight if it's delivery," said Gretchen A. West, a drone specialist at law firm Hogan Lovells, who is not familiar with Project Wing's plans. "Nobody knows how long it's going to take." Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

It’s one way for hyperconvergence to finally make inroads, and for vendors of hyperscale hardware to spread out their customer base, between mid-level enterprises looking to deploy hybrid clouds, and corporations that need workload portability across continents.  Live migration of virtual machines makes something called “portability” feasible today, but distributing pieces of workloads (minus the overhead of VM operating systems and libraries) across cloud platforms, on-premises and in public spaces, requires a more effective orchestrator. To this end, Kubernetes (with Google’s backing) is competing against Apache Mesos in the open source space. “The first thing you have to do, when you’re making this move toward Kubernetes and cloud-native architectures,” said Cisco’s Owens today, “is you have to know where you’re going.  You have to have a vision, and have a set direction that you want to get to, and think about how you’re going to get there.  Don’t just start — Everyone just starts doing proofs-of-concept, and plays around with the technology.  That’s all good things to do, but at some point you have to know where you’re going to head with this new technology, and what you want to do as your organization grows.” Whose Level Playing Field Is It? Taken out of context and read as a paragraph by itself, Owens’ statement may seem a little generic.  But here, in this particular venue, there’s a point to his statement that could very easily be missed. The CNCF is a Linux Foundation project that came together in 2015 with the objective of assembling a platform around containerized workloads — the kind made popular that year by the rapid rise of Docker.  Google rapidly took the lead with the CNCF group, contributing code based on an orchestration concept it originally built in-house, called “Borg.”  The CNCF’s founding came literally on the heels of the creation of the Open Container Initiative, launched after Docker Inc. donated a critical piece of containerization technology — the container runtime — to the open source community. At first, there was confusion and even some dispute over why the OCI and CNCF were founded separately.  Didn’t both foundations seek to advance the cause of containerization? But since the start of this year, OCI’s mission started centering around standardizing the container format, which ended up helping wean containers from their tight association with Docker.  CNCF, meanwhile, focused on the orchestration of workloads, which include Docker and CoreOS rkt containers, but which have the theoretical possibility of expanding in scope.  For example, a China-based firm called Hyper has constructed a way for Kubernetes to orchestrate hypervisor-driven workloads, and to pair containers with a new kind of hypervisor. This while VMware (which we can assume will refuse to pay for any wall) “embraces and extends” the containerization concept, taking after Microsoft.  It’s built two container platforms of its own — one which pairs containerized workloads with VMware ESX hypervisors in a hybrid environment with vSphere, and another which would replace vSphere with a fully containerized system built on its NSX network virtualization platform. In both of those environments, however, it may be possible to run Kubernetes.  And if you’re asking why, consider that vSphere’s management environment may not have the flexibility to control microservices in a manner that makes them scalable.  Theoretically, VMware’s platform can be set to manage lower-level infrastructure, while Kubernetes devotes itself purely to making microservices work on the upper tier of a cloud-native architecture. Point of Reference On Tuesday, CNCF Executive Director Dan Kohn gave attendees their first peek at what that architecture would look like, at least on paper.  In version 0.9 of what it calls Cloud Native Reference Architecture (not to be confused with the IBM project with the same name) various open source components including Docker and Kubernetes are distributed among tiers in a five-ply stack: from top to bottom, Application Definition / Development, Orchestration and Management, Runtime, Provisioning, and Infrastructure.  Arguably, Kubernetes would have a place in the second layer from the top, and Docker and CoreOS rkt (pronounced “rocket”) one layer below. “In the era of GitHub, people do not need to be told what to do, they need help, services and common infrastructure that we can provide,” wrote CNCF Technical Committee Chairman Alexis Richardson (also the CEO of SDN software maker Weave), in a CNCF blog post published Tuesday.  “We ask them how we can help — we don’t tell them, we don’t make them join committees.  We love open source, which is fast, more than open standards, which are important but emerge slowly over time.  We are not a kingmaker organization — we believe the market and community will select leaders (plural) in time.” It’s another way of saying, don’t build walls.  The problem is, with five tiers in the emerging CNCF reference architecture, there are at least four opportunities for some very tall walls — or some nice fences.

The feature was removed “due to low usage,” a Google spokesperson has told us. Google told us they have “retired this feature” since it was not used as often as they would have liked. The Knowledge Graph popup in the snippets first launched in January 22, 2014. So after two and a half years, Google decided to drop the feature. Here is a screen shot of what the feature looked like and did: It was first noticed as being removed by RankRanger on November 3, 2016.

With Android Nougat the company waited a couple of months to release that document and today, it’s finally here. The 85-page document spells out Google’s plans for Android OEMs, and while most of the document is relatively unimportant for most people, there are some points worth talking about… “Android Extensions” The first big talking point, unearthed by Ars Technica, is “Android Extensions.” While we don’t fully know what Google has in store for this, it seems like it could be used by Google to bypass manufacturers and carriers to push AOSP API updates to the entire Android ecosystem at once. Currently, the APKs that power “Android Extensions” on the Google Pixel and LG V20 are mostly blank slates, but over time Google could use this to push more updates to Android’s core without requiring full system updates. With that said, Ron Amadeo from Ars Technica explains this better than I can: We have a theory: “Android Extensions” is a plan to bring the easily updatable app model to the AOSP APIs. Like Google Play Services, we think this app will be a bundle of API shims that Google can update whenever it wants. The difference is that everything in Play Services is a closed-source Google API, while “Android Extensions” would be collections of fresh AOSP code delivered directly to your device via the Play Store. The CDD’s stipulation that OEMs “MUST preload the AOSP implementation” is telling. It says that 1) this is AOSP code, and 2) OEMs aren’t allowed to “customize” it. And here’s the text straight from the CDD: 3.1.1. Android Extensions Android includes the support of extending the managed APIs while keeping the same API level version. Android device implementations MUST preload the AOSP implementation of both the shared library ExtShared and services ExtServices with versions higher than or equal to the minimum versions allowed per each API level. For example, Android 7.0 device implementations, running API level 24 MUST include at least version 1. Google May Force OEMs To Stop Using Proprietary Charging Standards Another important change is this document is Google attempting to push OEMs away from proprietary charging standards. If you ask me, this is the most important consumer-facing aspect of this document. Right now there are several different fast charging “standards” on the market ─ Qualcomm Quick Charge, OnePlus Dash Charge, Motorola Turbo Charging, Huawei SuperCharge, MediaTek Pump Express, and OPPO VOOC just to name a few. Even though Quick Charge is the most widely used standard out today, it doesn’t work on every phone, and Google wants to change that. On the Pixel and last year’s Nexus devices, Google uses USB Power Delivery for fast charging. Not only does this allow fasting charging, but it’s also compatible with all chipsets. That means that, in a perfect world, everyone could use the same fast chargers on all smartphones. In the current Android CDD, Google is “strongly recommending” that OEMs adopt USB PD, Google may later force this functionality as Android Police pointed out: Type-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers Nougat Doesn’t Require Vulkan APIs One other thing discovered in the CDD is confirmation that Nougat doesn’t require a chipset capable of using Vulkan APIs in order to run. It was rumored earlier in the year that this was Google’s primary reason for dropping devices like the Nexus 5 as well as OEMs for dropping devices running on older Qualcomm chipsets, but clearly, that isn’t the issue we once thought it was. Device implementations, if not including support of the Vulkan APIs: MUST report 0 VkPhysicalDevices through the vkEnumeratePhysicalDevices call. MUST NOT delare any of the Vulkan feature flags PackageManager#FEATURE_VULKAN_HARDWARE_LEVEL and PackageManager#FEATURE_VULKAN_HARDWARE_VERSION. Multi-Window Support Must Follow AOSP A feature that OEMs have long had, but Google waited on implementing is multi-window. It wasn’t until Nougat that Google added this feature as a part of the OS, but there was still concern that OEMs would try to make the feature “their own.” Thankfully, they won’t have the chance. A portion of the CDD strictly states the OEMs cannot implement any multi-window form aside from what is found in AOSP. We can already see this in action on Nougat-powered devices like Huawei Mate 9 and LG V20. Also worth noting, OEMs do have the option of not implementing multi-window if they choose to do so. For the most part, it’s unlikely that OEMs might skip this feature, but I could absolutely see it happening on devices with small screens oinadequatete performance. 3.8.14. Multi-windows A device implementation MAY choose not to implement any multi-window modes, but if it has the capability to display multiple activities at the same time it MUST implement such multi-window mode(s) in accordance with the application behaviors and APIs described in the Android SDK multi-window mode support documentation and meet the following requirements. All Android Smartphones Must Support Call Blocking The last big thing we’ll point out regards call blocking. In Nougat, OEMs must support number blocking for calls and messages. This includes adding a UI to manage blocked numbers. We can also see this in action on the Huawei Mate 9 which is running Nougat. 7.4.1.1. Number Blocking Compatibility Android Telephony device implementations MUST include number blocking support and: MUST fully implement BlockedNumberContract and the corresponding API as described in the SDK documentation. MUST block all calls and messages from a phone number in ‘BlockedNumberProvider’ without any interaction with apps. The only exception is when number blocking is temporarily lifted as described in the SDK documentation. MUST NOT write to the platform call log provider for a blocked call. MUST NOT write to the telephony provider for a blocked message. MUST implement a blocked numbers management UI, which is opened with the intent returned by TelecomManager.createManageBlockedNumbersIntent() method. MUST NOT allow secondary users to view or edit the blocked numbers on the device as the Android platform assumes the primary user to have full control of the telephony Page 59 of 85 services, a single instance, on the device. All blocking related UI MUST be hidden for secondary users and the blocked list MUST still be respected. SHOULD migrate the blocked numbers into the provider when a device updates to Android 7.0. These are just a few of the big changes from Nougat’s CDD ─ there are undoubtedly many more. Just from these, however, we can see that Google is working step-by-step to take back portions of Android, and we can see those results in Nougat. We’ve listed a few other changes below. Android Auto The Nougat CDD reveals updated specs on hardware requirements for Android Auto stereos including the size and resolution. It also shows that temperature sensors used with Android Auto must measure the cabin of the vehicle. Android Automotive devices MUST have a screen with the physical diagonal size greater than or equal to 6 inches. Android Automotive devices MUST have a screen size of at least 750 dp x 480 dp. For Android Automotive implementations, SENSOR_TYPE_AMBIENT_TEMPERATURE MUST measure the temperature inside the vehicle cabin. Audio The document also lays out information on how Android devices should handle remote controls on headphones connected via a 3.5mm headphone jack. 7.8.2.1 Analog Audio Ports In order to be compatible with the headsets and other audio accessories using the 3.5mm audio plug across the Android ecosystem, if a device implementation includes one or more analog audio ports, at least one of the audio port(s) SHOULD be a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack. If a device implementation has a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack, it: MUST support the detection and mapping to the keycodes for the following 3 ranges of equivalent impedance between the microphone and ground conductors on the audio plug: 70 ohm or less : KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK 210-290 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_UP 360-680 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_DOWN Package Manager Nougat also adds a requirement for installing APKs. More details on that can be found here. The package manager MUST support verifying “.apk” files using the APK Signature Scheme v2. Display Settings that change Display Density/Size must follow AOSP’s implementation: Device implementations are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to provide users a setting to change the display size. If there is an implementation to change the display size of the device, it MUST align with the AOSP implementation Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Google stops AdSense attack that forced banking trojan on Android phones Malicious ads exploited zero-day flaw in Android that auto downloaded files. by Dan Goodin - Nov 8, 2016 10:10 pm UTC Login to bookmark 51 Enlarge Google has shut down an operation that combined malicious AdSense advertisements with a zero-day attack exploiting Chrome for Android to force devices to download banking fraud malware. Over a two-month span, the campaign downloaded the Banker.AndroidOS.Svpeng banking trojan on about 318,000 devices monitored by Kaspersky Lab, researchers from the Moscow-based anti-malware provider reported in a blog post published Monday. While the malicious installation files weren't automatically executed, they carried names such as last-browser-update.apk and WhatsApp.apk that were designed to trick targets into manually installing them. Kaspersky privately reported the scam to Google, and engineers from the search company put an end to the campaign, although the timing of those two events wasn't immediately clear. "So far, those behind Svpeng have limited their attacks to smartphone users in Russia," Kaspersky Lab researchers Nikita Buchka and Anton Kivva wrote in Monday's post. "However, next time they push their 'adverts' on AdSense they may well choose to attack users in other countries; we have seen similar cases in the past. After all, what could be more convenient than exploiting the most popular advertising platform to download their malicious creations to hundreds of thousands of mobile devices?" A Google spokesman said a fix for the auto-download vulnerability was being tested in Chrome version 54 and was expected to be "live 100%" in version 55. (He didn't respond to a request asking him to elaborate.) He also said an Android security feature known as Verify Apps provided warnings when people tried to install one of the malicious apps. He didn't explain how the malicious advertisements snuck by Google security checks or what company engineers are doing to prevent AdSense from running similar ones in the future. Last week, researchers from a separate security firm named Cylance disclosed a separate malvertising campaign on Google AdWords that targeted Mac users. Kaspersky Lab researchers said it was clear from lulls in the campaign that someone or something inside Google detected and removed many of the malicious ads distributing the Svpeng installation files. But even after old ones were expelled, new ones managed to take their place. "The high rates and abrupt changes in the number of detections are easy to explain: Google has been quick to block the ads that the trojan uses for propagation," the researchers wrote. "However, this is a reactive rather than proactive approach—the malicious ads were blocked after the trojan was already on thousands of Android devices. It is also worth noting that there were multiple occasions in the past two months when these ads found their way on to AdSense; similar attacks have been occurring up to the present time, with the most recent attack registered on 19 October 2016." Monday's report is yet another reminder why it's generally a good idea not to change default Android settings preventing the installation of apps not carried in the official Google Play app bazaar. It also reaffirms the importance of remaining highly skeptical of webpages encouraging users to install files. Google deserves credit for quickly removing malicious ads and creating safety nets such as Verify Apps and a default prohibition on installing third-party apps, but as the Kaspersky Lab researchers point out, these approaches reactively treat the symptoms rather than curing the underlying disease.

(Carlo Allegri/Reuters)   On the day Americans are picking our next president, the dominant Google search was … abortion. The issue shared the top slot with immigration for much of Tuesday, suggesting voters wanted to learn more about where the candidates stand on reproductive rights: (Courtesy of Google Trends) The Republican nominee appeared to spark much of the interest. Searches of “Trump on abortion” had spiked more than 4,000 percent by late afternoon. Relative to immigration and the Islamic State, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn’t tangle much over abortion during the campaign, save for one high-profile exchange in the final presidential debate. Trump had slammed his opponent’s stance on abortion, mischaracterizing the kind of procedures he argued she would allow. “If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,” Trump said on Oct. 19. “Well, that is not what happens in these cases,” Clinton replied. “And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate.” The dispute renewed the discussion around late-term abortions, which happen extremely rarely in the United States, and generally only when the health of the mother or the fetus is failing. (Fewer than 1.3 percent of abortions in the country occurred later than 21 weeks, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and doctors won't perform the procedure at nine months.) ['Rip the baby out of the womb': What Donald Trump got wrong about abortion in America] That interest in abortion surged Tuesday isn’t that surprising. It remains one of the most fiercely divisive topics in the country: 56 percent of U.S. adults say it should be legal in all or most cases, while 41 percent say they feel it should be banned all or most of the time, according to a June analysis from the Pew Research Center. Both candidates’ broad stances match their party’s: Clinton says that she’ll defend access to the procedure, and Trump implied the Supreme Court under his leadership would overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that guaranteed an American woman’s right to terminate a pregnancy.   Since announcing her candidacy last year, Clinton has been clear on where she stands, arguing that Medicaid, the public health insurance for the poor, should cover low-income women who seek abortions. Trump, however, has broadcast a more confusing message. Before 2011, he publicly supported abortion rights. Last year, he described himself as “pro-life.” And throughout the campaign, he has sent mixed signals to voters. As The Post’s Philip Bump noted, he took five different positions on abortion in three days. In March, Trump declared women who get an abortion should face punishment. His campaign put out a conflicting statement a few hours later, asserting the physicians who perform the procedures should be punished — not the women. In April, Trump said the legality of abortion should be left up to the states. “The laws are set now on abortion and that’s the way they're going to remain until they’re changed,” he said, according to CBS’s transcript. “I would’ve preferred states’ rights. I think it would’ve been better if it were up to the states. But right now, the laws are set. ... At this moment, the laws are set. And I think we have to leave it that way.” [The gruesome language antiabortion activists are using to win support] In the last debate, he added that leaving such decisions to the states, once he’s elected, would naturally result in the illegalization of abortion. “Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that will happen,” Trump said. “And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court. I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination.” Clinton, by contrast, vowed to protect the law. “I strongly support Roe v. Wade,” she said, “which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine.” More from Wonkblog: Ginsburg smacks down a major abortion myth after historic SCOTUS ruling Anderson Cooper told Trump 'That is sexual assault.'

Google fixed dozens of vulnerabilities in its November update. Google on Nov. 7 released its November Android patches, which provide 83 fixes for vulnerabilities across three patch levels. Across the patch levels—a complete patch level identified as 2016-11-05, a partial patch level identified as 2016-11-01 and the 2016-11-06 supplementary patch level—Google is patching a total of 13 vulnerabilities rated as having critical impact. Among the critical flaws being patched is CVE-2016-5195, also known as the so-called "Dirty COW" vulnerability in Linux. The Dirty COW flaw is a privilege escalation that abuses the Copy On Write (COW) capabilities in the upstream Linux kernel. The issue was first fixed in Linux on Oct. 19. Google has included the fix for CVE-2016-5195 in its supplementary patch-level grouping. "Supplemental security patch levels are provided to identify devices that contain fixes for issues that were publicly disclosed after the patch level was defined," Google stated in its November security bulletin."Addressing these recently disclosed vulnerabilities is not required until the 2016-12-01 security patch level." The Dirty COW issue is only one of 16 critical privilege escalation vulnerabilities that Google patched in November. Seven of the critical privilege escalation issues were found in the Nvidia GPU driver. The kernel file system is responsible for three of the privilege escalation flaws with CVE-2015-8961, CVE-2016-7910 and CVE-2016-7911.Three additional privilege escalation flaws were found in other parts of the Android kernel, including the SCSI driver (CVE-2015-8962), kernel media driver (CVE-2016-7913), kernel USB driver (CVE-2016-7912) and the kernel ION subsystem (CVE-2016-6728). There is also a critical privilege escalation flaw in the Qualcomm bootloader. Qualcomm overall has been a source of many patched vulnerabilities in Android in recent months. In the October update, Qualcomm was the leading source of vulnerabilities with 30 patched flaws. For the November update, Qualcomm components account for 17 flaws in total, including four critical flaws (CVE-2016-6726, CVE-2016-6727, CVE-2016-6728 and CVE-2016-6725), five high-impact flaws and eight issues identified as having moderate impact. Android's mediaserver component once again is also part of Google's patch update. There are a total of 13 patches in the November update for mediaserver-related flaws, though only one of them is rated as critical (CVE-2016-6699). Android's media server and related libraries have been under scrutiny from security researchers since June 2015, when the first Stagefright flaw was revealed.

Good News: It Isn’t Just You Scroll to see how election-related search terms correlate—both positively and negatively—with depression-related and anxiety-related search terms. WIRED/Maimuna Majumder When it comes to maintaining the mental health and wellness of American citizens, the 2016 presidential election cycle has been less than ideal. In a recent article in Politico, therapists and their clients described how the last several months of political turmoil have thrown them for a loop. One psychologist even commissioned a poll of 1,000 voter-age respondents to probe the emotional impact of the election. The results: Nearly 30 percent of respondents reported emotional distress due to Hillary Clinton’s campaign, while over 40 percent reported emotional distress due to Donald Trump’s campaign. Perhaps most tellingly, a whopping 90 percent of those who reported emotional distress felt that the toll of this election was worse than any other election in the past, offering perspective into the general American psyche right about now. But most public health issues—including mental wellbeing—impact different people differently. Women are more likely to seek care for mental health issues than men, for example, while younger individuals are less likely to seek care than older men and women. Similarly, we might expect the mental health and wellness of certain groups of Americans to be more susceptible to the impact of the 2016 presidential election cycle. The effects could vary across state and party lines. Maimuna Majumder About Maimuna Majumder is an Engineering Systems PhD candidate at MIT and computational epidemiology research fellow at HealthMap. Her research interests involve probabilistic modeling, Bayesian statistics, and “systems epidemiology” in the context of emerging infectious diseases. So we tried to test this hypothesis. By looking at Google search traffic across the United States, we attempted to determine if anxiety- and depression-related terms correlated with searches for election-related terms—and if so, in which states and in what direction? Over the last several years, Google search traffic has been validated as an effective proxy for a variety of public health issues, including not only infectious diseases like Zika, dengue, and influenza, but mental health as well. When data on the incidence or prevalence of health conditions isn’t readily available—or is expected to be under-reported due to lack of care seeking—Google search traffic can help public health practitioners estimate trends. While searches for anxiety- and depression-related terms are likely a reasonable indicator for mental wellbeing, correlation against election-related searches doesn’t mean that the election caused changes in mental health. This kind of analysis merely allows us to explore the possibility that trends in mental health—as associated with the 2016 presidential election cycle (but not necessarily because of it)—may vary from one state to the next and, more generally, between red, blue, and swing categories. Insights like these may shed light on which groups, if any, should be surveyed to look for causal relationships. And if those relationships exist, steps can be taken to address election-induced emotional distress in the future. To assess trends in Google search traffic over time, we collected state-level data on eight election-related terms and two mental-health-related terms (“anxiety + anxious” and “depressed + depression”) from November 2015 to present in weekly increments. We then developed two multivariate models for each state to deduce which election-related terms correlated against anxiety and depression. Multivariate models allow us to assess the individual impact of each input variable (i.e. election-related search terms in a given state) on the outcome of interest (i.e. anxiety or depression in a given state), after controlling for the others. This is particularly important when the input variables are associated with each other, which is likely true here given that the search terms used are all conceptually related. Moreover, by building models that use data collected at multiple points in time, we’re able to consider expected week-to-week fluctuations in search behavior, such as upticks in election-related Google searches during campaign trail events, for any given state. And perhaps most importantly, by modeling each state separately, we’re able to determine if trends vary across borders. Seeing Red and Feeling Blue As it turns out, the relationship between election-related Google search traffic and mental wellbeing isn’t entirely uniform across the United States. For instance, searches for “vote + voting” and “voter registration” are more likely to be correlated with depression and anxiety in swing states than in red and blue ones. Meanwhile, when compared against blue and swing states, increased searches for both “Hillary Clinton” and “Donald Trump” are more likely to be correlated with depression and anxiety in red ones. This indicates that certain brands of susceptibility to election-associated emotional distress differ across groups; though voter-related issues seem to have most influence on mental health and wellbeing among swing state voters, red state voters appear to be more vulnerable to candidate-related issues. Though some generalizations can be made across party lines, state-by-state results are considerably heterogeneous, suggesting that additional time- and space-varying factors—such as local (i.e. state) government and finances—may also be important. Furthermore, future analysis at the county- or district-level may shed further light upon these relationships, which might be particularly valuable for swing states, where political affiliations are more fragmented. Increased searches for presidential election seem to be associated with searches for depression and anxiety. However, some findings are consistent across red, blue, and swing states. Among them is the fact that increased searches explicitly for “presidential election” seem to be associated with searches for depression and anxiety, which suggests that the 2016 presidential election cycle may have been a source of emotional distress for Americans, irrespective of political leaning. Paired with existing evidence, the results from this analysis add a dimension of complexity to an already compelling argument regarding the impact of the 2016 presidential election cycle on mental health and wellness across the United States. If correlations between election-related Google search trends and mental-health related Google trends are taken as causal, our findings indicate that—though susceptibility varies across groups—the ramp-up to today’s election has likely had adverse effects on the mental health and wellbeing of American citizens. No matter your state or party, the 2016 presidential election cycle hasn’t been easy. Here’s hoping that today brings our mental health and wellness some much-needed peace. Go Back to Top.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Microsoft has announced a fix to the bug that exposed Windows users to possible attacks. Google controversially exposed the flaw and after ten days revealed it publicly. This didn’t sit well with Microsoft, but Google said hackers were actively exploiting the flaw and users deserved to be aware of the risks. The bug is now fixed so Windows users can breathe a little easier. The attack was reportedly launched by Strontium, a group that has ties with Russia, which used vulnerabilities within Adobe Flash and Windows kernel to carry out the hack into user computers. This allowed hackers to do a number of things, including installing programs and deleting data. Microsoft claims if users were to be attacked, it would automatically enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection, therefore the attack would be minimized. Google exposed the flaw because users were exposed Still, it was dangerous on Microsoft’s part to wait nearly three weeks to patch the bug. They weren’t too happy with Google whistleblowing the bug for everyone, including possible hackers, to know. But it looks like the news spurred Microsoft to expedite the patch. If you haven’t updated your Window’s machine with the latest security patches, you should do that as soon as possible.

Tweet  Print This   Project Wing, Alphabet Inc. The latest Google drones have just started taking flight in the real world. But the team behind the technology is slowing down, trimming headcount and shelving initiatives as the experimental unit becomes the latest target of tightening budgets across parent company Alphabet Inc. Project Wing, a unit of Alphabet's X research lab, nixed a partnership with coffee giant Starbucks Corp., according to people familiar with the decision. Following the departure of project leader Dave Vos in October, the unit also froze hiring and began asking some staff to seek jobs elsewhere in the company, according to some of those people. They asked not to be identified for speaking about private company moves. RELATED: Google exec says package delivery by drone possible within a few years The decisions are part of a broader Alphabet effort to rein in spending and try to turn more experimental projects from loss-making risky bets into real businesses. Drones are in a particularly knotty place. U.S. federal regulation does not yet allow them for delivery, except in select test zones. However, Alphabet's deceleration comes as other technology companies, including Amazon.com Inc., plow money into drone delivery. "Project Wing has the potential to remove a big chunk of the friction in how physical things are moved around in the world," a spokeswoman for X wrote in an e-mail. "What we’re doing now is developing the next phase of our technology, and as always are thinking in a very broad way about all the potential use cases for delivery by unmanned aerial systems." In August, Project Wing won approval for test flights at a U.S. site, part of a White House effort to encourage unmanned vehicle delivery. Then in September, Alphabet announced a new foray: a partnership with Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. to deliver food via drone at Virginia Tech. 1 2 3 Next >> By Mark Bergen Bloomberg News Follow Transport Topics on RSS Twitter Facebook © 2016, Transport Topics, American Trucking Associations Inc.

Google to shut down Map Maker, its crowdsourced map editing tool Posted Nov 8, 2016 by Sarah Perez (@sarahintampa) 0 SHARES Next Story Alexa, who is winning the presidential election? Since 2008, Google has run an online tool called Map Maker that allows anyone worldwide to contribute data to Google Maps. Now, that tool is shutting down. The company announced today in its online forum for the project that the Google Map Maker service, as a standalone product, is retiring in March 2017. However, crowdsourced contributions to Google Maps are not ending, the company noted – instead, those will be transitioned to Google’s Local Guides program. Local Guides, to some extent, is a modernized version of the years-old Map Maker service. The older service offered an online tool and editor that let anyone submit updates to Google Maps, which moderators could then approve. The larger goal was to fill out Google Maps with road and business information in less developed regions where detailed local maps were not as readily available. However, as you may recall, Map Maker’s crowdsourced functionality also got Google into trouble in years past. For example, in 2015, Map Maker was used to vandalize Google Maps with an image of Google’s Android character urinating on the Apple logo. The company had to shut down Map Maker temporarily, following this and other spam attacks and obscene edits. Even as Map Maker was struggling to police its community, Google was developing its Local Guides program. The initiative, which began something like Google’s own version of Yelp Elites, today offers a way for volunteers to contribute to Google Maps and Google business listings, in exchange for points, rewards, as well as invites to special events and early access new features. Guides can earn points for a variety of tasks, like writing reviews, adding or editing places, posting photos, and more. Map Maker, however, offers an expanded feature set, including the ability to edit roads, for example. Its unique feature set will be merged with Local Guides in preparation for the March 2017 shutdown, as well as after Map Maker is closed. As the features become available, they’ll be posted to both product websites: Map Maker Help Forum and on LocalGuidesConnect.com. In addition, starting today, edits submitted to Google Maps will no longer be available Map Maker for moderation. This is so Google can streamline its efforts and speed up the time it takes to publish these edits, says the company. The shutdown makes sense given the overlap between the two initiatives, Map Maker and Local Guides. The shift should also cut down on the spamming and vandalism problems, thanks to the newer systems for editing and approvals. However, whether or not Google will be able to shift its full set of Map Maker editing tools to the newer platform by the time Map Maker shuts its doors still remains to be seen. Google used to announce its product shutdowns in larger batches, dubbed ‘spring cleanings.’ But this time around (and in the fall), the company has been more quietly closing up services without the fanfare. Yesterday, for instance, it shut down its move site, Google Showtimes. “Over the past year, we’ve rolled out new, easy ways for people to help keep Google Maps up to date by allowing them to make edits directly from the Google Maps app and through Google Search. Based on these efforts, in addition to our new Local Guides program, we’ve decided to retire Map Maker in order to improve and expedite the Maps editing experience on both mobile and desktop,” a Google spokesperson told TechCrunch, about the company’s decision to end Map Maker. “We greatly appreciate the millions of edits the Map Maker community has contributed over the years and encourage them to continue adding their local knowledge to Google Maps through our recently launched contribution channels and by joining the growing community of Local Guides,” they added.

Pixabay Tech 00:38 09.11.2016Get short URL 357152 Dr. Robert Epstein, former editor of Psychology Today, has published research on Sputnik News claiming that Google uses several techniques to manipulate undecided voters to favor Hillary Clinton. What other possible tricks do tech giants have up their sleeve? © Photo: Pixabay Robots Have Secrets Too: Google DeepMind AIs Create Own EncryptionGoogle search-result manipulation and, more recently, Google search autocomplete manipulation were just two techniques that Dr. Robert Epstein exposed in an earlier articles. His most recent article, written in cooperation with Benjamin Edelman, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard Business School, covers a wider variety of mechanisms that may exist. Whether they do exist is debatable, but the key idea is that there would be no way to trace or legally regulate them, if they do exist. ​For example, one such hypothetical technique could be implemented by Facebook, the world's largest social-media network. It's plausible that Facebook would send "go out and vote" reminders on election day. But what if not every US user gets this reminder? That could happen, the authors say, speculating that some voters could be conveniently left out. According to the article, it could add up to some 600,000 potential votes in favor of an opposing candidate, which is some half a percent of the US eligible-voter figure of 130 million. While one could argue that this is not a significant number, it should be noted that this technique is part of a larger scheme, also untraceable, and actually legal, under current US legislation. © Flickr/ mkhmarketing German Prosecutors Suspect Facebook Management of Hate IncitementThe estimated impact of Google's possible election-swaying techniques detailed in the earlier article is larger: Epstein and Edelman believe Google can shift up to 3.2 million votes by using autocomplete feature manipulation, and up to 10.4 million votes using a search results arrangement manipulation technique. All of these potential machinations are legal and cannot be controlled, let alone detected, unless strict regulations are imposed on tech companies, which is unlikely, due to those companies' close ties to the halls of power. If speculation about possible manipulation techniques might smack of paranoia, it is much harder to deny the fact that Silicon Valley favors Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton overwhelmingly, over the Republican candidate Donald Trump. It is known that donations from the tech sector to the Democrats exceed those to the GOP some 25 to 1. © REUTERS/ Carlos Barria Podesta on Hillary Clinton Campaign Strategy: 'No Idea How to Lift Her Up'The article also mentions that chief technology officers for both incumbent US President Barack Obama and Clinton are former Google employees. Google employees visited the White House over 420 times in the past eight years, as noted in an extensive investigative article by The Intercept that also points out, among other things, that some 250 people swapped their employment from Google to the White House, and vice versa. And thanks to WikiLeaks and the Podesta emails, we now know for sure that Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet, worked closely with the Clinton campaign. Both Epstein and Edelman support Clinton, but regard freedom of information to be more important than the success of their preferred candidate. "What if, next time, Google and Facebook support a candidate who serves their needs more than the needs of society at large?" the authors ask. There are two larger problems, apart from voter manipulation. First, as mentioned above, online techniques, including modifying matching algorithms for Tinder's Swipe-the-Vote online service, are not fraud, and a work must be done where legislation meets tech. It's Wild West for the tech giants right now. © AP Photo/ Darko Vojinovic Private Information of 550,000 Australian Blood Donors LeakedThose techniques are mostly invisible to the user, especially since most people believe that search engines simply report impartial and neutral information. It could be seen as working now, but that might change, with deep, long-term repercussions. Should the big lie behind this concept be exposed, people will lose faith in freedom of information in the internet. The impact of such a realization will reshape the market of information, as even the most fair of services will have a tough time convincing the customer that they are who they say they are. It's hard to tell how future presidential candidates (or other interested persons) will convince people who have lost faith in free, unbiased information. Will campaigns of the future become a reality TV show of cursing polemic and absurdity? That's one bleak version. ...

Comments By Gregg Keizer Follow Computerworld | Nov 8, 2016 1:02 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Windows PCs Security Microsoft Comments Microsoft today patched a Windows vulnerability that was disclosed just over a week ago by researchers from Alphabet Inc.'s Google. In one of several security updates -- 14 to be exact -- Microsoft fixed the bug in the Windows kernel drivers that Google security engineers had revealed on Oct. 31, 10 days after notifying Microsoft of the vulnerability. Microsoft credited Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google's Threat Analysis Group for reporting the flaw. Last week, the two said that because the vulnerability was being actively exploited, a disclose-within-seven-days policy applied. Microsoft's top Windows executive, Terry Myerson, castigated Google for the move. "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing, and puts customers at increased risk," Myerson wrote in a Nov. 1 post. Myerson claimed that the attacks in circulation were being conducted by a Russian group that previously was linked to a hack of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The gang, which Microsoft dubbed Strontium, has been responsible since at least 2007 for very targeted attacks against governments, militaries and diplomats around the globe. Also last week, Microsoft asserted that, while the latest Windows 10 upgrade -- the summer's Anniversary Update -- contained the flaw, an anti-exploit defense had been added to that edition prior to the attacks coming to light. "These Windows 10 Anniversary Update mitigations, which were developed based on proactive internal research, stop all observed in-the-wild instances of this exploit," Myerson said. Today, Microsoft patched the kernel drivers bug in Windows 10, as well as in Vista, Windows 7 and Windows 8.1.

Mello Jr. Nov 8, 2016 12:56 PM PT Google's Pixel smartphone, which made its debut last month, has gathered some high praise from reviewers. "The Google Pixel is now the best Android smartphone you can buy," wrote Joanna Stern in The Wall Street Journal. "The other leading contender was disqualified due to spontaneous combustion," she added, referring to Samsung's doomed Galaxy Note7, which was recalled for safety reasons. Stern was impressed with Pixel's display; its high pixel count made the blacks in photos appear deeper, colors more vibrant, and everything sharper. "The AMOLED display makes photos look better -- even ones taken on an iPhone," she wrote. Keep Your Pixels Dry Pixel "offers the look and competence of an iPhone with a truly great camera and loads of innovative software and services," David Pierce noted in a review for Wired. "It changes my answer to the question I hear most often: 'What phone should you get?' You should get a Pixel," he wrote. "The immediate joke everyone, including me, made on Twitter after the Pixel launch was that Google made an iPhone," Pierce added. "Well, that's true. As it turns out, an iPhone running Android is exactly what I've been waiting for." Pixel is a standout compared to other heavyweights in the market, according to Lisa Eadicicco, who reviewed it for Time. "All told, the Pixel is Google's first smartphone that can go toe-to-toe with Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy flagship," she wrote. "It's on equal footing with those phones in most of the areas that really matter, although its lack of water resistance is a setback. Still, Android fans who pick up the Pixel should be pleased, so long as they keep it dry." Smooth Performance Google hit a home run with its first branded smartphone, said Cnet reviewer Lynn La. "With Pixel, Google stepped up to bat, called its shot and knocked it out of the park," she wrote. It's a departure from Google's earlier Nexus smartphones, because you don't have to be an Android enthusiast to appreciate what Google has accomplished with the Pixel. "The only thing you'll have to be enthusiastic about is owning a phone that's beautiful, takes awesome photos, and has smooth performance," La wrote. "If you are, the Pixel's for you." The Pixel's performance was won kudos from Jason Cross, writing for PC World. "Android fans often complain about phones (especially Samsung's) that lead benchmark charts, but still somehow seem to stutter, chop, and sputter when you use them," he explained. "The Pixel XL does none of that," he wrote. "At every turn it is smooth, fast, and most of all, responsive." "Indeed, this may be the smoothest and most responsive Android phone I've ever used," he added. Rain on Pixel's Parade Some reviewers were unimpressed by Google's smartphone offering. "The absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre," Brian X. Chen wrote for The New York Times. "It is slower than Apple's iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung's smaller flagship phone," he noted. "Photos shot with Pixel's camera don't look as good as the iPhone's," Chen continued. "And Google's built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb." Pricing may be an issue with the Pixel models, noted David McQueen, research director for consumer devices and strategic technology at ABI Research. The Pixel is priced at US$650 and the larger Pixel XL is selling for $770. "This is quite expensive for what you're getting, and the build quality isn't as good as other flagship phones in the market," McQueen told TechNewsWorld. "It's going to be a bit problematic for Google to create differentiation for the hardware at that price point." Google's Hardware Future However, baking Google Assistant into Pixel's hardware could do that, McQueen continued. "Since it's the first device to carry Google Assistant, that will be a differentiator in an Android market where it's very difficult to make any sort of differentiation on the hardware," he said. Indeed, Google Assistant may not only be Pixel's prime asset, but also a key component of Google's hardware future. "The Pixel's greatest strength is really not anything in the hardware side," said Mark Hung, a research vice president at Gartner. It's Google Assistant, which is only available on Pixel, he pointed out. "It's the future of not only Pixel, but of the Google hardware ecosystem," Hung told TechNewsWorld. "Google is looking to make artificial intelligence the next platform after mobile and social." Gunning for Apple Reviewers taking the measure of Pixel never failed to mention the iPhone. There's a simple reason for that. "They're going after iPhone customers and other high-end phone buyers," said Ross Rubin, principal analyst at Reticle Research. It may be difficult for Pixel to make headway in that target market, though. "In developed markets, we're seeing a lot of saturation," Rubin noted. "It's a pretty late time to be a newcomer to the space, even if you have all the advantages that Google has." iPhone users were Pixel's target market, but the product also will benefit from the recall of the Samsung Note7, pbserved Kevin Krewell, a principal analyst at Tirias Research. "The Pixel will be the major alternative to the Note7," he told TechNewsWorld, "even though it lacks the Samsung product's stylus and wider carrier distribution."

On election day, many are hoping that this approach can give us insight into what in the world is happening at the polls — and thankfully the folks over at Google Trends have stepped up to provide us with election-focused data across the US and right here in California. While the general Google search trends are perhaps unsurprising (at the time of this writing, Prince Harry's girlfriend, Meghan Markle, is the top-searched topic in the US), when the data is narrowed down to election-specific queries we gain a pretty fascinating insight into what is happening across our great state. Google focused on five specific topics: long wait times, provisional ballots, inactive voter status, voter intimidation, and voting machine problems. As the below embedded tool shows, these issues are very much on voters' minds. "The goal of Electionland is to cover access to the ballot and problems that prevent people from exercising their right to vote," Google wrote of their project. "By exploring with us on Tuesday, you’ll be part of an experiment to see if data can can shed light on some of the biggest issues on the biggest day in the election cycle." And while this information straight from the horse's mouth is fascinating, USA Today did their own little bit of data gathering to bring us the following factoid: Many people across our great union just want to know "who is Taylor Swift voting for?" Ah, the big questions in life.

(Reuters/Bria Webb) (The Washington Post) - The long national nightmare of the 2016 campaign is finally coming to a close. There’s been a lot of talk about the potentially irreparable damage this acrimonious contest has done to our civic fabric. But if there’s any silver lining to the campaign, it may be that all the outlandish and divisive rhetoric is serving to get more people engaged with the political process. Here’s one datapoint that speaks to our current level of civic engagement, from Google Trends: Peoples’ interest in finding out where to vote has never been higher. The Google data show that searches for “where to vote” account for about twice as much Google search volume this November as they have in previous presidential election years in 2004, 2008 and 2012. Broader search queries, like “voting,” show a similar pattern — though those searches could be related to other information like early vote tallies, or to non-election voting for things like [voting for contestants on reality] shows. A person wanting to know “where to vote,” on the other hand, is probably looking for specific, practical information on where to cast a ballot. The related queries that Google shows for this search bolster that assumption — they include queries on how to register, how to vote, and voter eligibility. Other signs point to higher-than-normal voter turnout in 2016. More than 47 million voters have cast early ballots this year, smashing the previous early voting record of 32 million in 2012. Some of that increase is due to simple population growth, and some of it comes from more states adding early and no-excuse absentee voting this year. Early voting also indicates that Latino participation may hit record levels this year. This is likely to be a boon for Hillary Clinton, given Trump’s record-low support among Latino voters. Political betting markets have also recently taken a turn toward predicting higher turnout. At PredictIt, the odds for a turnout of 145 million voters — or more than roughly 63 percent turnout — have spiked in recent days. A number of that magnitude could be higher than the turnout in any election since the 1960s. High turnout could be favorable for the Clinton campaign. “Most often, higher turnout favors Democrats,” political scientist Michael P. McDonald told Factcheck.org earlier this year. This is because demographic groups that historically have low turnout rates — minorities and young people chief among them — tend to prefer Democratic candidates.

That depends… Should you run a Black Friday press release? That depends… Posted on November 8, 2016 by Brian in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Black Friday is one of the biggest shopping days of the year. It falls the day after Thanksgiving (November 25th this year) and often features great deals on products and services. The question for marketers and publicists is whether it makes sense to run a press release for your business for Black Friday. We will try to answer that. First, if it makes sense to have a Black Friday sale for your business, then absolutely have one. Your customers will likely appreciate it (and may expect it). But as far as a press release goes, you have to remember that a lot of the benefit of an online press release for a small and medium sized business is the Google News/Google boost you get based on targeted keywords in your headline. If your main keywords are ‘Black Friday” and some other general words, the competition in Google News/Google will be so extreme from major media and major retailers that there is almost no way your press release will get much attention. Look at the number of stories even today (https://www.google.com/#q=black+friday&safe=off&tbm=nws) The one caveat might be if you have a very specific niche, that when combined with ‘Black Friday’, might actually get some attention. A ‘long tail’ play on Black Friday. For example, painters in a smaller city could run a press release headline such as “San Rafael painters Contigo Brothers offer Black Friday deals”. You might actually rank ok for niche searches for “San Rafael painters Black Friday”. Or, substitute ‘painters’ for other services (massage, manicure, haircut, steakhouse, hotel, plumbing, roofing, etc). Whatever your product or service, make sure it has enough long tail keywords in the headline to be uniquely non-competitive. You are never going to get many views for your press release for Black Friday deals on Flat Screen TVS, unless you are Target/Best Buy/Walmart/Amazon. You get the idea. PS: The same goes for other major events on specific dates (Cyber Monday, Superbowl, Xmas, Back To School, etc). Unless you are going with long tail keywords in a specific niche, the competition in Google is just too extreme to get much attention for your press release. In general, probably the best way to promote your business around Black Friday and similar events is by a direct email deal to your customer email list.

These pinpoints are color-coded by search phrases such as “Long Wait Times,” “Provisional Ballots,” “Voter Intimidation,” and “Voting Machine Problems." Although “Inactive Voter Status” was the most searched phrase as of mid-afternoon Tuesday, “Voter Intimidation” had an 11 percent increase in search volume in the morning, around 7:45 a.m. By 10 a.m., “Voting Machine Problems” had a 35 percent increase in searches, and by noon this search had reached a 93 percent increase. In more rural areas of Pennsylvania, search phrases experienced different trends. In Brighton, a township of 8,000 people in the western part of the state, “Voter Intimidation” experienced a 201 percent increase. Meanwhile, State College experienced an increased search volume for “Provisional Ballots.” All comments eligible for publication in The Daily Pennsylvanian.

Uber wants to move people around with flying taxis, and Airbus is committed to producing this kind of vehicle. Meanwhile Google and Amazon are hoping to deliver packages with much smaller drones. All see the potential for fleets of unmanned aerial vehicles that can pilot themselves. But to make that vision a reality, we're going to need a new breed of sense and avoid technology. Echodyne, a Bellevue, Washington-based startup, believes it has the answer. The company announced preliminary test results from field trials of its MESA-DAA radar system today. It says the device, which is barely larger than smartphone, is capable of detecting even small aircraft at a distance 1.8 miles in varying weather conditions. The company says this breakthrough is driven by the use of metamaterials, which allow the radar to eliminate moving parts, making the hardware smaller and more battery efficient without sacrificing range. A lot of modern automobiles are now equipped with radar systems, in fact Tesla recently announced that it would be focusing on radar as the core technology in its autonomous driving system. But even long-range automotive radar from the likes of Bosch and Delphi only claim a range of a few hundred meters. They also don't typically have a very wide field of view. Echodyne's technology claims to be able to have a 120 degree field of view in azimuth (horizontal) and 80 degrees in elevation (vertical). Founder and CEO Eben Frankenberg also says his tech was designed to track a Cessna-sized object, which is much smaller than a car in radar cross section. "To make a drone delivery fleet a reality, you need two things," Fankenberg told The Verge. "You need units that can operate beyond a pilot's line of sight and you need a single operator for multiple aircraft." Right now both those activities are illegal in the US. NASA and the FAA are still in the preliminary phases of designing and testing a next-generation air traffic control system that would allow for those kinds of operations. But Echodyne's technology is exactly the sort of breakthrough the industry needs to make these missions possible. The company says it hopes to follow up today's field test results with a commercial offering of this new radar technology in the first quarter of 2017. Echodyne's new radar next to a standard smartphone.

"I am afraid our policies do not allow us to comment on campus/hiring outreach program," a spokesperson said by email. NEW DELHI: When the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) start campus recruitments in a few weeks, Google will only attend those at Delhi and Bombay and give the rest a miss for the first time in about a decade. Not because it doesn't want to hire graduates from the others but the company is confident that its reputation as one of the world's top technology companies will be enough to draw applicants from India's premier engineering schools. The move by Google to bypass the placement process at IITs in Kharagpur, Kanpur, Chennai, Guwahati and elsewhere clearly marks a break with tradition. It will directly hire any candidates it finds worthy without involving the schools. Such off-campus hiring is discouraged by the IITs but they didn't have much of an option when it came to Google, except for Delhi and Bombay. "There was an internal decision taken by the company to go the off-campus route. Most of the IITs agreed to this. But Delhi and Bombay have different processes in place," said an IIT Delhi official. An IIT Bombay official said, "We do not encourage off-campus placements." The schools aren't too keen on companies hiring directly because it disrupts the process for everyone else. "Students cannot sail on two boats during placements," said the IIT Delhi official cited above. People associated with IIT placement committees confirmed that Google had sought to be excluded from the campus placement process. Google declined to comment. "I am afraid our policies do not allow us to comment on campus/hiring outreach program," a spokesperson said by email. The company has already started approaching students directly and vice versa, said placement committee insiders at various IITs. McKinsey kicked off the trend last year by going completely off campus for its IIT recruitments during final placements. The management consultant hired about 10 IIT Delhi graduates through its alumni network, website and social media. Google's salaries offers are among the highest — upwards of Rs 1-2 crore for international postings. And as befits its stature, the company has a rigorous hiring process. Last year, it hired about 20 candidates from the five older IITs (Delhi, Bombay, Kharagpur, Kanpur and Madras).

(Image: Screenshot/Google) Prime Minister Narendra Modi took India and the world by surprise when he announced scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes in a late night announcement. This, according to the Prime Minister, is being done to combat black money, corruption and terror-financing. Such was the impact of the dramatic announcement that global interest in the related search terms showed a steep spike and keywords such "Narendra Modi" and "Indian rupee" ranked higher than the US presidential elections on Google search trends even in the US. This is notable as it is Election Day in the US, when the country votes for its new president in the culmination of a long and contentious campaign that has captivated the interest of a global audience. However as the election day proceeded in the US, the interest in the Indian government's tactical move showed a dip. The surprise move by the Modi government was designed to bring in unaccounted wealth into the mainstream economy, as well as hit the finances of terrorists who target India and are suspected of using fake high denomination notes to fund operations. Nearly 40 per cent of India's economy is driven by small- and medium-sized enterprises that largely run on cash transactions. Economists fear the move could impact these businesses, and in turn have a knock-on effect on economic growth.
