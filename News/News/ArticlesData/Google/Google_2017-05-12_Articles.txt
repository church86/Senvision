Informa Inside Self-Storage ISS Magazine Google Changes and Your Self-Storage Facility’s Mobile Website Yesterday Comments Posted in Articles, Online Marketing, Marketing, Management Print By Sam Hook For years, experts have stressed the importance of having a mobile-optimized website for your self-storage business. Updating your website to ensure it performs well on mobile devices as well as desktop computers is significant. But we’ve finally reached the tipping point on this issue. How your site displays and performs on mobile devices is now more important than how it does on desktops. You can no longer think of your website as a desktop platform that works on mobile. Rather, you should consider it a mobile website that also works well on a desktop. Google has always been at the forefront of understanding how users interact with the Web. In this article, we’re going to cover some of the search engine’s major changes over the past couple of years that demonstrate the shift from desktop to mobile and how they could affect your business moving forward. An Increase in Mobile Searches Google announced in 2015 that it tallies more searches by people using mobile devices than desktop. A more recent study from intelligence-gathering platform Hitwise puts the figure at 58 percent. It seems likely from trend data that the figure has increased. Searches from mobile devices are even more important for self-storage companies than many other industries because a third of mobile searches have local intent, according to Search Engine Land, a source of search engine industry news and trends. “Local intent” means a person is searching for something related to a location, e.g., “storage near me,” or “storage in Phoenix.” Google’s Changes Google is as a critical source of traffic to your website, so you need to pay attention to any changes it makes. The company has been trying to get business website owners to move toward mobile optimization for years. Here are some of the things it’s done to encourage the transition: Accelerated mobile pages (AMP). This is a Google-backed project that provides a way for website owners to create pages that load quickly on mobile. How? By limiting the page content to little other than the main subject. The aim of AMP is to make browsing more pleasant for people who are using data on their phone. If you’ve started to implement AMP and want to know that you have everything set up correctly, you can use Google’s AMP Test. Mobile-friendly update. In April 2015, Google released the first version of its mobile-friendly update. This was a simple pass-fail test. Google looks over your site and checks whether it’s mobile friendly per certain factors. If your website doesn’t pass, Google won’t rank it as highly in the search results when someone is searching on a mobile device. Google updated this again in May 2016 to boost the effect. My company recently completed a study to determine approximately how many self-storage companies passed this test. About 18.3 percent of U.S. and 31 percent of U.K. storage websites failed. It’s likely this is an underestimate, and a higher portion of all storage sites would fail. If you want to check how your own site performs, you can use Google's Mobile-Friendly Test. However, it’s been brought up recently that you can pass the test yet still be labeled as not mobile-friendly if your site takes too long to load. Mobile-first index. This is the most important change, though it hasn’t yet been released at the time of this writing. With this change, Google is going to look at your site as if it’s being searched by a mobile user. This is essentially Google saying your mobile site is more important to it than your desktop site. Why make this change? Companies sometimes show users different content depending on the device they’re using. Considering most searches are now done via mobile, Google wants to know its serving the best results for this majority. These changes demonstrate how mobile is now more important than desktop for your storage company’s website. That means making sure your website displays correctly on mobile devices but also optimizing it for users and search engines. If you don’t keep up to date with the way things are progressing, you’re going to get left behind!

Google's answer to the Amazon Echo launched across the UK - including Coventry and Warwickshire tech stores - last month. The high-tech gadget not only plays music but provides information on request and obeys spoken commands, the Mirror reports. Tesco has now updated its If This Then That (IFTTT) channel to enable Google Home users to add products to their shopping basket using just their voice. Read More Owner of ice cream shop at the centre of near miss crash speaks out "Rather than setting up an individual IFTTT recipe for each product, you'll now be able to create just one recipe and then ask your Google Home to 'add milk to your Tesco basket' or 'buy more eggs'," Tesco explained. Google Home While Amazon Echo does something similar, allowing Amazon Prime customers to order products from Amazon.com using just their voice, Tesco claims its Google Home integration is smarter. Read More Aldi urgently recalls vanilla extract amid nut allergy risk fears "If you already shop with Tesco regularly we'll do our best to bias those search results towards the products that you'd normally choose, so that IFTTT will add your favourites/usuals for you – not just the first result," it said. "Another feature we've added alongside this is around existing orders. "If you already have a slot booked then IFTTT will amend the existing order and if you don’t it will just add it to your basket."

ASSOCIATED PRESS An Uber driverless car waits in traffic during a test drive in San Francisco. ASSOCIATED PRESS Share Tweet Share Email Comments Print SAN FRANCISCO — A rare order from a federal judge alerting prosecutors to possible criminal misconduct by Uber or a key executive deepens the turmoil swirling around the ride-hailing company at a time when it’s grappling with other legal and image problems. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco referred a civil case filed against Uber by Waymo to the U.S. Attorney’s Office “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets.” It threatens to trigger a second U.S. government investigation of a company that has pushed the legal boundaries through most of its eight-year history. At stake is Uber’s estimated $68 billion valuation, a possible public stock offering and the future of its self-driving car program, which its CEO has said is the key to the company’s future. Waymo, a self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., sued Uber in February alleging that Uber is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own fleet of autonomous cars. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in San Francisco didn’t respond to requests for comment. Experts say prosecutors are likely to follow up on Alsup’s order and launch an investigation. The probe, combined with other legal and image woes, will reduce Uber’s value and in the worst case could threaten the San Francisco company’s existence if investors leave, criminal charges bring huge fines and legal action stalls autonomous car research, the experts say. Uber wouldn’t comment today on a possible criminal probe. Federal prosecutors already have requested information from at least two cities about use of phony software to thwart city officials looking at whether Uber was following local regulations. Alsup wrote in his order that he wasn’t taking a position on whether prosecution was warranted. Alsup, 71, has gained a reputation as a no-nonsense judge since he was appointed to the bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton. The Harvard Law graduate has experience in trials involving high-profile technology companies, including a 2012 patent and copyright infringement case pitting Oracle against Google. For a judge to take such a public step, he must have more than just a whiff of criminal activity, legal experts say. Prosecutors get many tips, but rarely do they come from a judge who is familiar with evidence and the legal elements of what is a crime. “This is not some private informant that slipped an envelope under the door at midnight. This is public and it’s a judge,” said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. An investigation would siphon executive resources at Uber just as CEO Travis Kalanick faces many other challenges, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in white-collar crime and corporate governance. “The possibility that you could get criminally indicted would be exactly the wrong thing for Uber,” Coffee said. In addition to the apparent inquiry into the software called “Greyball” to impede city inspectors, Uber still has to deal with Waymo’s high-stakes espionage lawsuit. It alleges that Uber is using trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who formed his own company which was bought by Uber $680 million. After that deal, Levandowski began to oversee Uber’s self-driving car division. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents with details of a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what’s around them. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo’s ideas, maintaining that its Lidar is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to answer most questions posed by Waymo’s lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He recently agreed to step down as Uber’s top self-driving car executive, though he still works at the company. Beyond the possible criminal cases, Kalanick in February was forced to quit President Donald Trump’s council of business leaders after Uber was boycotted by some customers. A female former engineer made a series of sexual harassment allegations about her boss, and a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver went viral, forcing him to concede he needs leadership help. Earlier this week, Uber suffered a huge legal setback when a European Union judge ruled that it was a transport company and could be required to get licenses and permits in the 28 EU nations. Uber had sought to persuade Alsup to send the dispute between Waymo and Levandowski to private arbitration hearings. But the judge rejected that request, meaning the case will play out in a public court, risking further image damage for Uber. Just months ago Uber was discussing what could have been the largest public stock offering in history, but its troubles now make that all but impossible, Gordon said. Uber can survive the troubles, but it has an uphill fight, said Gordon. If the court finds that Uber used Google’s Lidar technology, that will slow Uber’s autonomous car research, leaving it behind competitors. The company would either have to pay Alphabet to use it or buy it from a supplier, both expensive options, Gordon said. The company’s strategy of fostering rapid growth by flouting laws may wind up being its undoing, Gordon said. “The empire is striking back.” Related Items Travis Kalanick , Donald Trump , Bill Clinton , united states , north america , san francisco , california Click to comment Guidelines: Please keep your comments smart and civil.

RIP: The Nexus 5 isn't getting Android 7.0 Nougat, let's say our goodbyes David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/08/22 10:00am PDTAug 22, 2016 156 Plus 1 on G+ 1393 Share on Facebook 181 Share on Twitter Total Shares1730 Editorials News Nexus 5 Nougat 7.0/7.1 Videos While the Nexus 5 will likely live to see the chewy center of Nougat via community-built custom ROMs, it's now official that the phone so many of us loved will never get a Google-sanctioned Android 7.0 release. Let us mourn. The Nexus 5 launched in late 2013 - you can go back and read our review, in which Liam, Ryan, and I took to a single post to combine our thoughts on the device. They were largely positive, too: the Nexus 5 was easily the most well-received Nexus phone yet when it was released, with both consumers and reviewers alike praising its unique design, excellent performance, and compelling price. The Nexus 5 sought to really perfect the formula Google and LG laid out in the Nexus 4 and, in my opinion, they came exceedingly close. The Nexus 5 was the right phone, at the right time, at the right price. And lest we forget, it was the debut device for Android 4.4 KitKat, introducing us to features like immersive mode, the storage access framework, Google Now Launcher (as it was later known), and a more modern NFC payment system. The Nexus 5 was also the butt of battery life and camera jokes from day one, and honestly, I cannot believe how many of you here at Android Police are still using one. Looking at traffic in the last 30 days - nearly three years after the Nexus 5 was released - it remains easily in the top ten devices visiting the site (yes, I'm creeping on your device stats in our site analytics). It's downright impressive the level of dedication and, frankly, love people have shown for this phone, and I have to imagine many of you are on a second or third (or fourth?) battery replacement by now. But it just goes to show what a truly huge impact this phone had on the larger Android community. It was a big deal. So while the Nexus 5 won't be getting Android 7.0, passing the ominous "oldest supported Nexus" crown to the Nexus 6, it will likely be remembered for years as the Nexus phone - full stop. And I think that's appropriate. So, Nexus 5, farewell. I can only imagine how many people will be hacking Android 10.0 onto you another three years from now... assuming the battery lasts long enough to flash a ROM. Oh, and the Nexus 7 (2013) isn't getting Nougat, either. Rita made me throw that in for completeness. Here's my obit: the Nexus 7 was a thing, too. Both of mine broke. RIP, I guess. (I jest - mostly. The Nexus 7 was a fine little tablet, but there's no doubt the Nexus 5 overshadows it today.)

If so, it is not really a funeral. More like putting it into assisted living, and here you are talking about it like it is already dead right in front of it. YOU MONSTER. David Ruddock security patches are more like making sure the dogs don't get to the corpse on the way to the hole in the ground tbh SyCoREAPER I guess you guys have never visited XDA and seen the developers that keep devices alive. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells I Nouggat-it? OXCVO >.> Christopher Bement <3 Sam Del Valle RITA WHY Avisshek Rita for President 2016 Thomas Bohn No, high political offices in Libanon are not really safe offices. Avisshek I forget that she lives in Lebanon not in the US . mea culpa Thomas Bohn Just noticed, the office of president of Lebanon is vacant since 2014. Either everybody wants that office or nobody. Not really familiar with the politics of Lebanon. Except a friend of mine did his study abroad at the American University of Beirut. Which he described pretty much as a bubble in the city. Speakers at rallies are behind protective glass. But that was like 10 years ago. Stellar And then XDA said otherwise LOL Corbin Davenport Excuse me Nexus 5 owners, do you have a moment to speak about our lord and savior, CyanogenMod? John Johnson This! Flashing custom firmware became so easy my grandma could do it. YOTOPRULES . my grandma can't even turn a laptop on Airy230 You won't have me! Pure Nexus will be my light in the dark Đức Thành Pure Nexus is the shit, man. Avisshek blasphemy will not be tolerated, behead this infidel Kim Reyes well i think you must read the thread of Pure Nexus for Hammerhead, i think they released the last version for it too. Đức Thành Really? Damn. AverageDipper Oh no... I can't bear two heart breaks in a row. Well I guess I will wait for a porting like for the N7-2012 John Georgiou oh yeah Max I'm with you, my Nexus 5 will live and die as Pure Nexus forever. Charbel Aoun N5 owners don't care about updates , we have XDA (including CM, Ressurection Remix, pure nexus and planty others). Only noob users care Joshua Worth Or those of us that pride security over broken ass janked always some kind of bug ROMS Đức Thành I guess you haven't tried custom ROMs much these days? I'm not that heavy on trying out custom ROMs so I've only been using Pure Nexus on my N5 for a while now but it's fast and reliable and completely bug-free, or at least there's no bugs I know of that don't exist in stock ROM, too. And they even update it regularly, so security is not really an issue. I'm not sure other devices get the same treatment, but if we're talking about the N5 it's got it pretty sweet. Joshua Worth No you're right Nexus devices have had the least buggy Roms it's just all the effort that goes in to reading know if and keeping up I'd rather Google be the maintainer of my software rather than my own labor doing so. Gjorgi Lazarovski Tell me all about the bug free stock builds. CyberPunk ROM's built from AOSP are usually less buggy on Nexus/One devices compared to other devices. I'm I right in thinking that? Railwayman You are right - AOSP based ROMs are always working best on devices with readily available sources and developer friendliness - Nexus mostly even if there are some other brands as well. So the Nexus 5 will have a long happy XDA life. instinct Aren't you so cool because you unlock your device and put your own rom on? It's really not hard, but it's not something most users are going to want to do or care to do. Philip Worthington I agree with you, but then, most average users will have upgraded by now too, or didn't even buy a Nexus 5 as it was not a 'mainstream' phone brand. So, I'm guessing the Nexus 5 is now largely maintained by the people who keep it alive through ROMs, and by the people who upgrade as little as possible and don't care what OS they have as long as phone calls and Facebook works.

C64 Religion is BS Greets from your friendly neighborhood Atheist someone755 You'll have to take my AOSPA shrine from me over my dead body. jay Atheism is a religion too. C64 Do i worship an invisible not existing man? Do i pray to an invisible not existing man? Do i build a church for an invisible not existing man? Do i believe a fairytale of an invisible not exciting man? No i don't. I believe in science and come sense . So what part of atheism is the religion part? Adalberto Barbosa PWNED Railwayman It lies within the 'I believe in' part. Belief in nothing is still... a belief. Another thing: You can't prove the *non-existence* of something. It is possible to discuss probabilities and so on but not that something has been 'proven not to exist'. Atheism becomes a religion when it is backed up by statements implying that different things has been *proven* not to exist. Typical examples are 'I am an atheist because *I know* that there's no God' or 'I don't believe in God but in science'. Teal’c I really don't want to get in a religion war on here but, atheism is a lack of belief, it's not a belief system and most certainly not a religion. Religion has figureheads, it has teachings that adherents follow, the only thing that ties atheists together is a lack of belief in deities. That's it. Also where is it "backed up by statements implying that different things have been *proven* not to exist"? Railwayman There are different takes on atheism and without going more offtopic I can only say that *some* of its proponents use wording that revolves around the idea that they 'know' the non-existence of certain things, meaning that this 'knowledge' is the background of their stance. This type of atheism is usually linked to certain ideologies and is an integrated part of them. Joris Griffioen That's all fine and good but it's *not* a religion. Have you looked up the definition recently? Or ever? "the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, especially a personal God or gods." Atheism is not a religion. It is the lack of religion. It's not really that hard to comprehend, but to make it easier here are some quotes: 1) If atheism is a religion, then bald is a hair color. 2) If atheism is a religion, then health is a disease. 3) If atheism is a religion, then abstinence is a sexual position. Railwayman It is a belief system simply put; sometimes mixed with ideology. Religions is the 'belief in a God', atheism is the 'belief' that those things doesn't exist and is therefore an opposite standpoint. The point stands: 'Belief in nothing is as much belief as the belief in something'. Neither religions or atheism are established 'facts' - they are simply different viewpoints and exist in different iterations, including ideological connections. I don't believe in 'belief systems' such as the traditional religious or atheistic ideas about 'fairytales' (common atheistic argument) or not 'fairytales' etc. The problem is always that the view becomes ideological, thus clouding the vision. I wouldn't dismiss ancient texts as being 'fairytales' - that kind of standpoint is ideological. Teal’c There are not "different forms of atheism" but there are "atheists who have different beliefs", as I said, the only thing that ties atheists together is a lack of belief in deities. Like Stalin was an atheist who murdered millions of people, but you're not going to claim that a tenet of atheism is murdering people are you? (There is a certain Catholic who is not a very nice person and actually posted a video equating atheists with Stalin but yeah, murder is not an "atheist belief") Coolington There's no different takes on Atheism, there is one and the synonym for it is non-belief. If you write your own definitions, do so, but don't pretend they are valid. An atheist is a person who does not believe in God or gods. That's the only definition that should be considered by anyone. Railwayman Pure atheism is what you write. Then there are 'political atheism' (i.e. atheism as a part of a political ideology or because of such ideology) and different takes where the 'belief in nothing is still a belief' apply. 'Political atheism' is usually demonstrated by people who 'in the name of atheism' want to prohibit certain things - a typical and controversial example is the issue of creation vs the Darwin theory. Political atheists typically are working hard on making Darwinism 'mandatory' in such a way that it becomes the 'truth' and all other theories are then 'wrong'. Especially theories related to creation in one way or another are in the 'wrong' category and heavily fought. There are several cases where 'atheism' is closely linked with politics and where it is heavily promoted as the 'right way', 'only truth' followed by 'prohibit religion' or 'prohibit ideas with connection to certain books' - the solution to everything is Darwinism and different theories whose major common denominator is that they are secular. I.e. secularity is more important than anything else and everything with any kind of 'religious' origin or connection are to be rejected. It is also common that 'atheism' and 'reasonable thinking' are claimed as being equal - i.e. 'every reasonable thinking person should be an atheist' (this is pretty common statements from 'political atheists'). Atheism isn't a 'proven fact' - it is a belief system that has developed as an anti-thesis against religious belief system. A key issue is that the statement 'There is no God' (which is quite common among atheists) break the rule of 'you can't prove the non-existence'. When statements along the lines of 'I know that there is no God' followed by things as 'We know that Darwinism is a fact - not a theory and that other theories are wrong because... we have proven Darwin as being right' paired with different 'prohibit X because X is a religious thing' - atheism simply goes right into the group of other ideologies and belief systems. A more reasonable way is simply put: 'I don't know whether there is a God or not - at this time the existence hasn't been proven and its non-existence hasn't been proven either since it is impossible so I remain neutral, open for both possibilities' and also 'the issue of the origin of the species is complex, Darwinism is a very compelling theory but there are also other theories - including those related to creation that are worth to explore further'. I accept 'pure atheism' but have an issue with 'political' or 'ideological atheism' where it is promoted as being a 'fact', 'science', 'scientifically proven' and so on, especially when it is linked to closing doors on any other theory or explanation model that have links to religious books and ideas. I.e. 'X is wrong because those ideas are based on religion and as an atheist I know that religion is wrong and just a fairy tale'. C64 Sciences proved that religion is BS. So end of story Railwayman Sounds like an ideology rather than a fact...;) jay You believe in nothing which is a belief none the less. You call yourself an atheist along with many other people who are like minded. That my friend is a religion. C64 That my friend is BS jay You are just different part of the same closed minded body of people you put down. I'm right, no I'm right, no I'm right. All the same. marcusmarcus2 Sure. How well does Android Pay work on it? Testraindrop As good as on stock ROM, oh wait its not available outside of US... marcusmarcus2 I'm inside the US and Android Pay does not work in CM13 for my LG G3 but works fine when I restored it to stock Android. So no, not as good as stock ROM. DucKienTruong I think you missed the joke Francois Roy Are you still living in 2010, or what? XD AOSP / Pure Nexus or bust.. Kristian Ivanov No. VAVAMk_2 RIP lil buddy Dale they should support nexus 5 instead of the nexus 9 - which all have hardware failures by now. nexus 5 running like a champ. Sir_Brizz I loved my N5 up until the moment I smashed the screen about a year ago. :( It's still one of my favorite devices design-wise. MJ Fuck! Nate Porter Well if they announce a new nexus today that i can buy to replace my N5 I won't be as mad. Alex Gourenko Goodbye old friend, you did amazing job and didn't age at all. Best phone I ever had! Jordan Smellie "I have to imagine many of you are on a second or third (or fourth?) battery replacement by now." Wait, I'm missing something. Last time I looked into N5 replacement batteries, the summary was: "Low-quality/fake replacement batteries are terrible, and some of them explode, and there is literally no way at all to tell whether the battery you receive is fake... unless it explodes, in which case it was fake. Good luck!" Has that changed? Because I am STILL on the original N5 battery, and it is... not great. Not as bad as I suppose it good be, and a lot better than an explosion, but still not great. Is there now a reliable source for high-quality N5 replacement batteries? Andrew There were some typos on "fake" batteries that people could spot supposedly. I ordered a "legit" one a few months ago and it seems alright. Todd How much better would a new battery be in my n5? I'm always plugged in so I don't really know how bad my battery is. I can still get about 2 hours screen time. Andrew You're good if you're still getting 2 hours. Mine was randomly turning off any time below 90% battery. Jordan Smellie Okay, fine. But you ordered a "legit" one from *where*? And how did you know it's "legit", since we don't know what to look for? Andrew This is what I went off of https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus5/comments/3rrflh/how_to_spot_fake_nexus_5_battery/ FunkyRasta To me it was quite the opposite... original battery bursted in flames and smoke as I was prying it out of my N5 :D Luckily, the window was open and my hands quick. Chinese knock-off wasn't so bad to me after that. pfmiller Probably not a bad idea to drain the battery before doing surgery. Mark555055 https://i.ytimg.com/vi/nSz16ngdsG0/hqdefault.jpg Charbel Aoun We don't care google, we have XDA!! 😏😏😏 blindexecutioner So long. You run better than the 5X but I guess it had to happen at some point. Dmitry Teplyakov Waiting for nougat source code release! C64 God dammit, no update for my Galaxy Nexus eszklar LOL. I have two Galaxy Nexus running CM13. In XDA I trust to be running Nougat in the near future. Same for my Nexus 4. MJ What do you need so many old phones for? eszklar It's a personal thing with me - like my OG N7000 Note running Android 6.0.1. Why? Why not? My daily driver is a rooted Zenfone 5 still on KK as I haven't found a solid ROM for it. But I respect the community work done by CM/XDA. My HP TouchPad is running Marshmallow as well and its fun. samwichse I have my wife and my old Nexus S phones acting like home phones. Google voice means that when she leaves her current phone on the basement couch, I can reliably get her on the "upstairs phone"and so on. MJ What does reliably get hold of mean? All my calls go to VM and I will call you back when have time or what ever depending on the nature of the call. No one should be expected to always be available to pick up the phone or reply to a text immediately. samwichse "No one should be expected to always be available to pick up the phone or reply to a text immediately." And yet, always being able to HEAR the phone ring is pretty important when you have a family. Eker Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo JSo It will live on with the developer community. But luckily I upgraded to the 5X. I will always cherish my Nexus 5 though. I love that device. ali0cha Same here. Upgraded from 5 to 5X and I miss Nexus 5's form factor. Now I must admit that I'm pretty happy of the 5X thanks to the addition of the fingerprint scanner but I sometimes miss the size of the 5. JSo I was actually wanting the 6P for it's size. But the 5X was cheaper. me me Best Nexus ever. Hope they can make a true successor. me me My Nexus 4 didn't get Marshmallow either but via XDA and a screwdriver it's got recent rom and fresh battery and going strong with LTE on T-Mobile David Ruddock man that must be one crazy screwdriver me me Lol I meant a screwdriver is used to replace the "non replaceable" battery pfmiller Those sonic screwdrivers can do anything. N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ one crazy screwdriver http://www.drinkswap.com/images/da/2857.jpg Alawami F. cadtek91 I guess we can root now. Todd I uprooted a year ago so I could use my work email system... I might have to root again now. OXCVO 3 years and i'm still not ready to change my Nexus 5 to any other phone mitchilin Same. Had it since release day. No need to upgrade. psydex Did you change battery? mitchilin Nope. Battery is fine. Llama rocks. Emerald I'm getting a Nexus 5 this month, could you please explain me what Llama is? mitchilin Basically just an app to automate your phone. Eg: Leave house -> Turn off WiFi, dim screen, anything else to save battery Enter house -> Turn WiFi on, turn brightness to full, everything else It can take a while to 'learn' all the areas e.g. home, work but after that it is bliss. I have my phone to turn on to silent when i enter work for example. http://bit.ly/1THFX6B kks thanks for this! AlphaQWER "Leave house -> dim screen Enter house -> turn brightness to full" May i ask where do you live? In my hemisphere there is a trace of the sun ;) mitchilin England. OXCVO N5 has been a great phone all these years But hey, times change, so must our phone's I'll accept that later xD for now I'm going to keep using it mitchilin Yeah, I am so gutted though Hardtarget24 awww, my wife is still using a 5, kinda shocked it's not getting Nougat, doesn't feel much slower than my 5x. (also we still have a 2013 Nexus 7 that works fantastic, kinda too bad about that as well) roberto.elena Shocked? You must live under a rock. TechGuy22 aww too bad lol Aaron Berlin Great song written by the incomparable Paul Williams. N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ the incomparable Paul Williams https://fuzzytypewriter.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/paulwilliams.jpg Alastair Vincent The Nexus 5 was a fantastic phone but the 6P has more than adequately replaced it for me. I'm really mourning the end of the Nexus 7 2013. Still use mine every day and the £400 Pixel C is not a realistic replacement for my needs. Rita El Khoury This. There's no decent replacement for the Nexus 7 and I'm still using mine daily for AP work. So sad. pfmiller Still no decent replacement for the N5 as far as some of us are concerned :'( Todd We have high hopes for this year. pfmiller Yeah, specs seem good. Not crazy about the looks or the presumed lack of wireless charging, but it'll probably have to do. mike shwilly At least 5P doesn't have a fugly camera nose on the back N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ no decent replacement for the Nexus 7 K1 /problem james fuston The K1 isn't exactly 'readily available' in the US. Most major retailers show it as out of stock and have for quite some time. Alastair Vincent The K1 is the best option, I think, but it's still a third party device and I refuse to buy those unless I absolutely have to. When my 7 dies I'll probably get a K1 or whatever is available then. Cory Wilson Eh I disagree. I upgraded to the k1 and I still like the nexus 7 better overall. Nexus 7 doesn't get laggy if you don't reboot it every 24 hours, and the k1 also has terrible battery life. Also the nexus 7 looks aesthetically more pleasing, and is lighter in the hands. Shield's better for gaming, and the stereo speakers are facing the right way and are louder and clearer but aside from that the nexus 7 2013 is better imo N6Perfection ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ N7 is very nice, indeed, and you're right about the k1 battery being sucked by the heavy gfx capability, but the K1 is the 2nd most beautiful creature (1st is our OG Shield Tablet with charging light, Nvidia stylus and charging light) I've ever seen. I had the N7 for a while when they had that $99 dollar sale, but at its intro price of 199 (same as the K1), Nividia knocks the N7's dick in the dirt. I never had lag or reboot problems, ever. Last time I looked I had uptime in the thousands of hours. but it does get hot when I play SkyForce for extended periods and take it out of the case. Do you have a custom ROM in it? I still say it's the best, dollar-for-dollar tablet in the world. I used to fantastize about an Nvidia 5.5" phone that matched the K1. cormaster628 No I mean I have to reboot once every day or 2 or it gets laggy. I just hope it gets nougat a big reason I upgraded was knowing the nexus 7 would most likely be cut off. I don't see why it wouldn't. Even the original shield tablet is around the same age as the nexus 9 which is getting the update mike shwilly Why not Shield Tablet? Rita El Khoury I want a Nexus tablet, for the no-fuss updates. Also the K1 is almost a year old by now, and that's based on a year old tablet to begin with. I want something to last me another 3 years. Allen D Ehh except it's been updated pretty well over its life. Its only 6.0.1 though NVIDIA is a smidge slower than they should be on occasion. Honestly unless there something super crucial its gone from 4.4.4-6.0.1 and will get 7.0 at some point. I'd put NVIDIA about third for consistent updates on their products beyond HTC lol. Sergii Pylypenko Will Google release another 7-inch $200 tablet? With AMOLED screen and Tegra K1 this time? Fatal1ty_93_RUS Shield Tablet? marcusmarcus2 Pretty sure they mean no replacement for it within the Nexus family. LANCE Nexus 6 replaced my 2012 lol Rich Taylor If you find a good one, let us know. Lots of people out there still using the N7. I actually replaced it with a new N7 last year because I love it so much. drksilenc I have been using the nvidia shield first gen as a replacement for mine. Lord Argyris Best Netflix and YouTube machine ever. I don't use it for much else these days, but when I'm on a video binge it's my go-to. Battery is still good, and while its age is finally showing in its UI performance, it still does everything I need it to do. I might go with CM or Pure Nexus going forward, or I might just stick with Marshmallow for another year and hope Google releases a viable replacement. Imparus 6P is to big for my hand, so have been waiting on the Nexus 5 v2 that the 5x was suppose to be. someone755 I broke my 2012 N7 (that I stupidly bought in April 2013). It would need a display and digitizer replacement, which would end up costing me around $60 (+shipping, taxes, and the time I'd spend repairing it). Thing is, for that money I could get a used one. Not to mention it's slow as all hell. I've been searching for a tablet to replace it but nothing comes close to what a 2013 N7 could offer for its original price. james fuston The Zenpad S is worth a look. I replaced my N7 with it Urmil Shroff This article almost makes me cry. R.I.P. Nexus 5💔🌹😭 Michael Schaap But how about the Galaxy Nexus? David Ruddock sure right after Google releases Android 7.0 for Eli Whitney's original cotton gin eszklar "I find your lack of faith in CM/XDA disturbing." **(Apologies to Darth Vader)** roberto.elena There are rumors Texas Instruments' engineers are looking into it. 30014 We don't talk about the galaxy nexus around here. Nothing but bad memories. james fuston Alternate song choice https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-w6m-nhUcos David Ruddock shit yeah RaiDei I will NEVER say goodbye. My Nexus 5 is my backup phone right now. I've had to go back to it three times in the last year and a half. I'm hopeful that the 5P (or whatever the Sailfish will end up being) is a worthy successor. I can't wait to get back to a 5" phone. Anders https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JWTaaS7LdU Brazilian dude As a person who lives in a country were taxes are huge and the last Nexus to come here was the N5, I still won't let him go. The Motos are really expensive and even devices like Moto G are not that different compared to the N5. It's a shame, but still going strong after 2.5 years. FunkyRasta If only Google would do it all over again... Keep the design, replace plastic with metal if you must BUT DON"T BRING SOMETHING SO ATROCIOUS AS 5X. I'm losing hope on Sailfish too with that big chin and thick edges. Seriously, slap AMOLED on it , bigger battery and 821 and there you go ! Man can keep dreaming. For me the best designed android phone ever. Materials could have been better though. pfmiller No, no metal. It's not at all worth sacrificing wireless charging for. cvm It can use a metallic frame like the 2014 moto X. pfmiller If they must. As long as they don't sacrifice anything for it I don't particularly care what they make it out of. Renaldi I. I cringe when I think about the crack in the frame next to the volume rocker. :( My N5 was still precious though. Curse the infidel who kidnapped it from me. YOTOPRULES . not amoled, screen burn-ins. wade_county http://i.imgur.com/394Qm3p.gif Pedro o Raposo Best phone I ever had, even after having to replace the flex cable! Good night sweet prince, I love you... shhhhh... it'll all be over soon.. *covers phoneps face with a pillow* Namra Reading this on a Nexus 5 !!! samwichse Replying to this on my Nexus 5 :) Erik Patrón Replying to this reply on a Nexus 5 YOTOPRULES . Replying to this reply to this reply on my PC MilwGuy Replying to this on my laptop, while crying over my Nexus 5 sitting next to it. Ben If you used the logic that a phone died once it's not going to get updated, you could say about 85% of current Android phones are dead. Koen Scholten Now I need to put both my Nexus 7 and Nexus 5 to rest :'( Mako Sold it today, bye buddy :( Đức Thành Incredibly sad news as I've got both a Nexus 5 and a Nexus 7 2013. MrSonicBoom Mines still a great backup device. Needed it a couple of times already. lomsha Lol George Byers Rip, that poll you guys ran a couple weeks back asking if you ran a custom rom would probably have much different results of it were asked again today. Mike in KC Easily the best money I've spent on a cell phone to date. Just recently moved to the 5X, but got tons of use out of my N5's (wife used one as well). Charlie Paxton Too bad, I really like my Nexus 5! I still think the Nexus 4's case design is unparalleled, btw. Perfect proportions. Benoit Bourdua Still using mine as daily driver. Original battery and all. Better than even odds on keeping it one more year. I will have a look at the new 5-incher but I'm not ready to let wireless charging go. Defenestratus All smallphones must die. Boolean Corporation My wife started using my old N5 32GB when her Moto G ran out of storage with only three apps. I once told her that she could take my spare iPhone SE and she told me she didn't want to get jumped. I proceeded to tell her that I'd be more pissed off if somebody stole the N5 than the iPhone. I just love that thing. It was the best Nexus. I'm on a 6P right now but really missing that form factor. cnccnc I'm sure telling your wife that you're more worried about which phone gets stolen than her went over well. Amirite? Boolean Corporation Actually that is not what happened, but I'm amused you understood it that way. Joshua Worth Good old jerkboys can't update the Nexus f---ing 5 past Marshmallow yet iPhone 5s is about to get iOS 10 clearly the Nexus Product Team and Google Android Team aren't trying to compete. Apples to Androids I know but come on Google I want to love Android but you're making it so difficult Mikhail Pozdnyakov Pomyanem pacani ;( refthemc Went through 2 of these bad boys. Shame that the power button always starts to fail Kenneth Porter Experiencing this now. pfmiller Mine has gotten stuck twice, but only for a few hours of trouble all told. Aside from that it works perfectly. Kenneth Porter I cracked the glass on my N5 a week ago and my N7 stopped working the day before yesterday. They were faithful devices. RIP Kenneth Porter Still using N5 despite the crack though. So is it a zombie? samwichse I just bought a replacement front glass from eBay 2 weeks ago First phone glass I've ever broken and it was spectacular (a long cartwheel across a parking lot after caroming of a concrete curb). Kenneth Porter First glass I've ever broken to. My drop wasn't as epic it was literally 1foot from the ground. How difficult was the repair? Or did you get someone else to do it? samwichse There were a lot of little pieces to transfer over, but not really actually difficult to do. The hardest part is unsticking the battery without damaging it. Rod My N5 is still going strong, 2 years and 4 months after. And I don't plan on replacing it any soon. I hope Sailfish turns out alright, anyway. It sucks to lose official updates, guess I'll need to resort do XDA now. Hugo Just got the OTA on my 6p:) Joshua Worth I had about 20 different Nexus 5's so you could say I had a thing for them Hugo If I unenroll my device from the betaprogram after receiving the stable build will it still "downgrade" and reset the device? Andy Chow I own two Nexus 5, and both still have good batteries. I can't believe that I now need to replace them. What a waste! I can't believe Google doesn't give us 3 years full support. It was released October 31st 2013. Bad Google, bad. No other phone appeals to me. The Nexus 6p a little, but Nexus 5 is the design I love. Rufflow Why? It doesn’t stop working this evening you know. Shivam Agrawal Will the 2014 Android One devices receive the Nougat Update? TigerMike901 Still using a N5 in the family, but it was bought as "new" on ebay last Nov, so I guess it still has a bit of life left in the old girl. Well, sad but not unexpected, that it won't get 7.0, so here's my moment of silence........................ok let's party for 7.0 release!!! Fatal1ty_93_RUS Don't worry, Nexus 5 guys. Us Nexus 4 folks share your pain and know how you feel right now Yaki Forto WHAT ABOUT ME??? I watched in horror as my N4 wasn't updated to MM, even though it could handle it, and now history is repeating itself with my N5! WHYY GOOGLE WHYY??? mattcoz Hopefully this period of mourning will be short lived and Sailfish will be released soon. Namra Heart=broken Testraindrop Still using my Nexus 5, first battery still, still more or less the same battery life as in the beginning. Oh and it has wireless charging... And I will continue to use it for at least another year if Sailfish won't have wireless changing and will be too expensive compared to direct competition again like last years Nexus devices in Europe. My N5 will get N like my 2nd N4 currently runs Marshmallow. Bryan Pizzuti What's a "Nexus 7 (2013)?" Is that like a bigger Nexus 5? Were only 2013 of them made? That might explain a lot. Railwayman It seems like the cave is a bit dark but simply put: A "Nexus 7 (2013)" is a 7 inch tablet with a Snapdraon S4 made by Asus as a successor to the original Nexus 7 from 2012, which then became known as the "Nexus 7 (2012)" in order to keep them separated. The LTE version is a bit like a "bigger Nexus 5" but don't have a dialer for regular phone calls but also weaker hardware (Snapdragon 800 in the Nexus 5). The number of devices manufactured is way higher the "2013" BTW. Pascal Shame that Google can't update 4 phones. b0b Who cares when there is Allo and Duo running on your N5. Without doubt the most important software of the last 10 years, relegating new Android versions to insignificant status. codemonkey85 I'd be satisfied as long as the Nexus 5 and / or 6.x and earlier devices get Google Assistant. Sam Del Valle Goodnight sweet prince JD Good night sweat prince Rich Taylor RIP. It was the 1999 Toyota Camry of Smartphones. Arthur Dent Erm. Ok. Simps Had mine from release and still on the original battery and screen. On my 4th pack of screen protectors though. Hope to find out soon if she will be staying with me another year or not.... benkxda Choose your ROM: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2475401 Arcest There's almost no difference in buying Nexus to buying Samsung. Google doesn't update few years old devices anyway. Leonardo Baez you dont know what are you saying. Samsung get updates 6 to 8 month later. Arcest Ok, maybe android updates should be paid, so it makes sense for manufacturers to put money on the already sold devices. Arthur Dent Lol, you're funny. Manufacturers need to move devices. They don't care about updates, or the few hundred or few thousand customers that might actually pay a couple of bucks for it. That's pocket change to them. To be clear, there's no way in hell most people would even consider paying for an Android update. Most people never update Windows, that's why Microsoft was giving away hundreds of millions of free upgrades for Windows 7 and 8.1 computers. Because VERY FEW people ever actually pay to upgrade Windows and they wanted to move as much of their user base to Win10 as possible. Mathias Why? Hardware can't handle the update? Or is google just too lazy to support their own phone? Testraindrop The second Leonardo Baez actually business model. If theys till support it, many people will not buy a new one Abdullah Alam Shh Leonardo Baez well... he asked Ali Mahdavi Hey AP Introduce a hashtag for this post, so we can share our 'Goodbyes' on Twitter with it. Ali Mahdavi #AufWiedersehenN5 Arabella Blair I wasn't expecting this to be a problem for me, since they always used to launch the software with the new Nexuses... I need that new phone to replace my poor dying boy! Max I couldn't agree more, the Nexus 5 will always be remembered as *The Nexus Phone*. It's the first phone in my life that I used for more than one year and that I didn't get rid off after upgrading, I still have it at home and every few months I turn it on, update everything and play with it for a couple of nostalgic minutes. Faheem Ahmed :( so sad about nexus 7 and nexus 5 L((( there were really capable both in ram and hardware....google screw u! apple still supports its iphone 5s Pawbro Google should seriously rethink their Nexus support model. 18 months is way too short, barely enough for 2 major updates and this nothing special, other manufacturers can do it as well, only the speed of delivering the updates is on Google side but it's not enough. Nexuses should be the Android flagships with real long term support for like 36 months, Apple can pull this off, Google could as well. Marco Lancaster I agree, but now Google is launching 2 devices per year, then will have more devices to support, so consequently they hardly will change this. Pawbro Apple does it as well and they can work with this. Right now if I'm not wrong they support iPhones 5s (that was released in 2013 as well and still is scheduled for OS update), 5c, 6, 6s, 6s Plus (it's already 5) with new ones around the corner, then iPads which are a few devices as well. For a company like Google it shouldn't be a problem to support 8 devices in total (6p, 5x, 6, Player, Pixel C (I don't even know what is this), 9 and additionally 5 and 7 2013). tiger iPhone 5 support as well...released in 2012 still getting the latest. drksilenc With alot of features stripped out... tiger Like what? Sudev 3D Touch, raise to talk are hardware specific features. iPhone 5, 5c, 5S are getting all the software features i.e. iMessage enhancements, Lockscreen, HomeScreen and under the hood changes and not to mention security enhancements. Ryan Johnson The OS itself is still the latest supported version. Why do people expect every iOS release to have all the latest features on old devices? Mark 2 years is not too short at all. 2 years is enough for many people, who change theyr devices in 1-2 years. 3 years would be good, but even then people will complain for a short time Pawbro It is too short. It doesn't matter that some people change phones all the time. 3 years is something around Apple support time, if Google could upgrade their support time to Apple levels it would be enough to satisfy majority. Mark of course 3 years would be great, but 2 is enough and, considering the community, we can't complain sproc Yeah, about apple. They just stopped selling the iphone4s a few months ago, and won't be updated to the next version of ios. Think of the Indians. Or really, so what? Joris Griffioen Apple's phones are also literally twice as expensive... Phoenix Nessun italiano? Mark io xD Phoenix in trepidante attesa delle factory Mark vuoi fare una installazione pulita? Phoenix proprio così Brian Jones My Nexus will forever live on 😔 Pimbiolina A pitty really. Please Google, reconsider it! mizkitty Still the perfect Kali NetHunter device... TylerChappell Man, I was really hoping that the Nexus 7 would receive 7.0 as a final sendoff! It really would have been absolutely perfect after all. Android 7.0 on a 7.0-inch device, ugh! But with July 2013 being when the tablet was released, I wonder too if the Nexus 7 will get a Marshmallow build with a September security patch since it is already on the August patch. The August patch could perhaps very well be the last update the ole trusty 2013 Nexus 7 will ever see! putte40 Nexus 5? Gave it away to my mother in law. The galaxy nexus on the other hand i still call "the nexus" Mikhail Oh, well. I was planning to change my phone anyway, I did want it to try android 7 before getting a new one, just in case... but whatever :'( Sohanur Rahman RIP Legend :( Mix RIP My heart was mending from two nights ago and this just added another hole. If you read buckle up, it's a roller coaster but it ends like prom night.....sadness. My Nexus 5 went into colourful screen confetti mode and became useless, someone suggested a port flex cable could fix it as they had a similar issue. COOL, lets try it out! I ordered one and took everything apart, WAY easier than I had hoped but it didn't work, phone wouldn't even charge. I take everything apart and hook up the stock flex cable, phone charges and screen turns on just doesn't have an image..... This is where I figure, ok maybe I did didn't have everything pressed in firmly on the replacement port flex cable. I hook up the replacement port flex cable that I ordered and put everything back in place, plug in the charger and POOF a little puff of smoke shoot out from the top half of the phone, above where the port flex cable goes. I unplug and quickly grab my phone to go outside thinking it was going to blow up...nope, just fried something in the top section of my phone. This $15 cable 100% destroyed my phone but at least the seller is giving me my money back. Yay? moogle.nine I'm not burying my N5 until it's original battery dies! (Or until we get some release dates for the new Nexii) It actually holds a charge pretty well for being almost 3. Daniel Gherard Time to wait for Cyanogenmod 14. ManInAbox Third battery here, would have upgraded last year but the 6p was too big and the 5x was underpowered, and all the other phones have glass backs ffs. Dmitry Stepanushkin Same. Third battery. whispy_snippet Nexus 5 with original battery FTW! *sad face* Oliver Cervera ✔ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ "We've only just begun"? Wut? My choice for this kind of farewell "For Those About To Rock, We Salute You", you also got fireworks, what else you can ask. Squiddles And here I am with my Nexus 4 ;_; Dmitry Stepanushkin mine fallen and front glass broke. RIP Bruce Wayne Ehhhh...easily one of my most hated phones. The design was generic and bland. The back was uninspiring and looked like a plain module. With its battery, camera and GPS issues, I couldn't wait to upgrade to the Nexus 6. I certainly don't miss that phone. Gunnar Lindberg Årneby Lame Google! Nexus 5 may have launched in 2013 but its still just one generation behind. Now we have to get our developers new phones and buying a 5X today seems like a bad move. Dmitry Stepanushkin Well Android 6.0.1 will be supported for a long time and there is no single feature in 7.0 I cant live without. Still we have some security updates. Unless these new Nexuses will be like wooow in both price and quality, I see no problem staying on Nexus 5 for another year or two. As long as it will work. danifeb The best article ever red on ap _jack_ Does anyone have a list (or remembers) the prices of all the nexus phones? I remember them with competitive prices at the beginning. But the current generation is far away from that (at least for Europeans; 5X with 32 GB is 550 USD, 6P with 64 GB 800 USD in the Play Store). I know, even in Europe there are some retailers like Amazon with cheaper prices, but that's almost one year after the release (the 5X is 320$ there currently for me) and I don't want to wait that long when the new devices are shown later this year ;) Yaki Forto Remember the $300 N4? That went on sale to $200 after a year in the States from the Play Store? _jack_ I think it was a high-end device by the time of its release; so 300$ is pretty good :) yaman koudmani Yeah, it was the best phone you could buy. Literally. When it was released, *very* few could rival it in sheer specs. JD So I can almost accept this and move on. Except Google didn't give us a new Nexus that we can move on to. Don't anyone dare say the POS 5x. OG N5 and KitKat I shan't forget you. You converted me from iOS, and now Google is doing everything in its power to convert me back. Seriously Apple doesn't even need to lift a finger. I really want to stay the course. Lollipop I'll never forget how much of a POS you were. HTC and Google make Android Great again. Willem Toren What battery problems? My Nexus 5 still going strong on the original battery. Still love this phone! minica So, David, what is the other 9 most used phone to visit AP? James Brown Thank God for CyanogenMod! Nougat will live for the Nexus 5. Dragos Lucian The amazing people on XDA will keep it alive for a few more years. ArclightX Channeling GroundsKeeper Willie... "I didn't cry when me own father died... but I'll cry now" /bawls... Lex.Butler Maybe the fact we are still using a product that is nearly 3 years old is that the era of constantly upgrading is over. It's ended in tablets, PCs and cars so why not mobiles? Vano Beridze I bought it in 2013, been loving it from the day one. Even today this is the prettiest phone for my taste. Persuaded my brother to bought it in 2014, Made a present to my wife in 2015. All of the Nexuses run fine. Because mine was the early model, I had to replace the power button. The phone came with Android 4.2, updated to 4.3, 4.4, 5.0 and recently 6.0. Updates were quick and till the end of this year security updates will be available. Hopefully Sailfish will be the worthy successor. I don't blame Google for not giving us Nougat. Even on Marshmallow the device starts to show its age. Still will be using it till next year good sale of Sailfish. Hope to get it for $250 :) Robin Steinberg Press F to pay respects. Yoy Guys, do you know if there's already custom rom for N5? 10x Robert Been a proud owner of a Nexus 5 almost from release. Never replaced battery, always stock android experience for me, still using it to this day. Now i think i'll wait for some good N port by the good folks at XDA, and then port over. IF i don't end up buying the new Nexus, which does not seem to be high-end specs at low price like the N5 was. So chances are i'll be using my trusted Nexus 5 for quite a while still =) Buckeye Kenny The Nexus 7 ended up convincing me to sell my iphone 5s and get a Nexus 5x Nexus5Rules Oh, damn it! TO HELL WITH GOOGLE. Let's build our own ANDROID N for our dear NEXUS 5♥ Darth Karki Yep, still on my wonderful launch Nexus 5. No battery replacements. No case. No nothing. Just this wonderful phone. Still just as smooth as the day I got it. I even tried out a Moto X Pure for a couple weeks but ended up returning it as it's SLOWER than the Nexus 5. Unbelievable. Still waiting for something to top it. Paul Still using Nexus 5 myself and it would of been nice if they supported 7.0 and from what I heard it seems the phone could support it but then it's no big deal, most software will run like it always does so little changes, probably got another year or year and half with the Nexus 5 before I upgrade, boy is that going to be a big upgrade lol. Logan Snyder The writing and the music, so perfect. Really makes something as simple as a device no longer getting updates seem like a proper funeral. Lucas Araujo My Nexus 5 have almost 3 years (bought in December 2015), have a cracked screen, the power button is barely working, the battery is showing signs that need to be replaced, the LTE does not work here in Brazil (bought in Canada, incompatible frequecies), but is still a MONSTER! RIP! ='( Harold_Mansfield Ugh! That Nexus 7 info at the end hurt. I'm on my 4th Nexus 7. Best little tablet ever. Guess it's time to start thinking about moving on if I want to run the latest OS. I'm sure my 7 will find a new life as a simple reader or entertainment remote. Mike Pick up a Shield K1 if you can find one. The only other worthy android tab IMO, and I'm sure they will update it soon to Nougat. Biff Wonsley I just bought a Zenpad Z380M, the 2gb, 8" version, for $129. It's great for browsing, messaging, RSS, Reddit & books. Sure, it's got the crapware, but it's easy to ignore/disable/not worry about, especially when I remember how little I paid for it. Harold_Mansfield Thanks for the tip. Will check it out. Gabriel Macys RIP N5. I need a replacement now. Aside from a screwed up proximity sensor for calls, it works as fine as the day I bought it. Ameya RIP ... Am using since 2013 Looks like time to buy new one.. Any suggestions? What about new Nexus 2016 device? when its releasing ? are they going to release ? Miguel Fernandes My favourite android phone, bought a S7 today just because of the battery. Uncle_Rico I did the same thing in like in mid June.. my battery was dying in less than 2 hours... and the power switch was double-tapping when trying to turn on the display, shutting it OFF instead..!?!? I loved that phone though.. until it hit the "100,000 mile" mark... :/ truskymx May the 5 be with you. Badelhas That settles it. I love my m8 but if the next nexus is as follows as the 6p but in a small factor I will buy it. latz Easily the best Nexus phone released. 5x was/is a missed opportunity.... gakukid im gonna buy a cheap phone sone and was thinking between a nexus 5 and a LG G3 what would you guys thiink would be the best? Im kind of worried about the battery of Nexus 5 Evil Nick Never had battery problems. Love that phone. Vladan Nikolic Noooo moriel5 Back when I still had my Nexus 5 (from the AP&Avast giveaway here, it was stolen half a year later(and the police, unsurprisingly, did nothing at all, not even what they were required by law (I have a neighbors who are lawyers, I made sure to research this, it's just too bad that it was not worth the financial expenses)(there is a bias in my country against the citizens, however, murderers who were brought from outside by the US and the USSR, and continually receive support from them, and the UN, although they didn't even have an "official" state until a few decades ago (and I'm not talking about those who are innocent (yes, there are innocents, but it gets completely blown out of proportions in the news) receive the support from our government and and military that the citizens are supposed to receive (I'm leaving out identifiable details, so people who are not familiar with the situation may not understand my words precisely, sorry about that))), with some tweaks, I could use it according to my needs (which involve a lot of on-screen time and internet (back then I didn't have LTE, so WiFi/3G) for over half a day, so I have defeated the battery conundrum (as it was without compromising on over 90% of the native functions)(NamelessROM, no GMS, Xposed, and removing uneeded system apps, as well as replacing others with better alternatives). Evil Nick Who the hell has a nexus phone stock anyway ha ha ha Joshua Tanton I got my Nexus 5 right when they came out. Ordered it directly from Google. So on the first battery, never had any problems with it. So I don't understand the author ripping on its batteries. Also as an Android developer, kind of annoyed 7 won't be supported. I'll probably have to get a new device soon :(. What's worse though is that the next Google phone (which is losing the Nexus brand) will be loaded with bloat-ware instead of the wonderful Android stock. One of the main reasons I got a nexus to begin with. Jorge Juan Chico Running the N5 everyday for more than 2 years now and my battery still lasts the whole day easily. Currently on Cyanogenmod to test but I will likely stay here and wait for OTA updates. M is good enough for the N5, but it should run fine in N also. Jason Honingford What should Nexus 5 users upgrade to? Wireless charging is my favorite feature. I'm just waiting for the next phone that still supports it. MilwGuy My Memorial Speech: My Nexus 5 still has its original battery and the original Google case that was released in the beginning. It's never given me any major issues. Almost every app I've installed has worked great, with some oddball third- party exceptions. The camera was a bit annoying in 2013, but the updates since have really cleaned it up. Even now it's just received another Google patch update ready to install. It just keeps working. It will be difficult to let it go. It will never die. It will go on. :'-( Porga Croaticus The best phone I ever had. Serves me well even today. battery is still great. Will not be changing it as long as it last. Did not seen any new feature it cant handle, abd 5" screen with FullHD is still a standard. Fantastic phoone, great design. TestUser UserTest At least the most sold out Nexus 5 should get Android N :( Tom Horsley Actually, the Nexus 7 was the perfect tablet. It is exactly the right size and screen resolution. I cannot believe it is impossible to get a seven inch tablet with a high resolution screen these days, but they all seem to be either 8 inch (which is too big to hold comfortably) or seven inch with a crappy screen. Ed Ross I'm still using mine (well actually it is a replacement one as after a couple of years of use my original one developed a fault where the wifi would not work - glad I had insurance!). Thanks to the Lineage OS developers I'm now running Android 7.1.2 on it, with the May security patches too! I'm going to use this thing until it is impossible to use it any more.

This has been the reality ever since the operating system's inception, and so far nothing has managed to change the situation. But Google thinks that it can help, at least somewhat, by incorporating a modular base into its OS, starting with the Android O release later this year. Up until this point, here are the steps that have been required for an OS update on a non-Google device to make it into your hands: Quite complicated indeed. But from this point on Android will gain a "Vendor Interface" (VI), thanks to a new development effort Google calls Project Treble. The VI's aim is to separate the "Vendor Implementation" (that is, "the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers"), from the Android OS framework. The new VI will sit in between the Android OS framework and the aforementioned Vendor Implementation. And the new VI will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS), which is analogous to the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) that Google has been using for API testing of apps. The VTS will ensure forward-compatibility of the VI. The benefits of this approach are pretty obviously laid out in the images above. Before, the VI needed to be reworked after every single Android OS framework update, while from this point on that won't be the case anymore. This does indeed have the potential to speed up the update process for end users, but probably not by a lot. Your handset's manufacturer will still add its own "features" on top of the new Android release, and some of those will still need rewriting. Nothing changes from that point of view. It's only that, with Project Treble, no additional work will be required from silicon manufacturers before a device maker can get into that process. Project Treble is already live in the first developer preview of Android O, and it will come to all new devices launching with Android O preinstalled. In addition to all this, Google says it's working with its silicon and device making partners to move some of their code changes, such as specific features for a specific network in a specific country, into the Android Open Source Project code. That means the developers of that code (say, Sony and Qualcomm) won't need to rework those patches for every new Android iteration anymore.

By: Shilpa Published: Saturday, May 13, 2017, 8:00 [IST] There were lots of rumors speaking about the upcoming Google Pixel devices. Some rumors have also claimed that the codenames of upcoming Google handsets will be Walleye, Muskie, and Taimen. As per the information is known so far, Walleye and Muskie will be the codename for Google Pixel 2 devices whereas, the Taimen is rumored to be a brand-new tablet. Now the same Taimen has appeared on benchmarking website, GeekBench and as expected, it gave away some details concerning the specs and features of this upcoming device. Let us see what are that information in brief. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Benchmarking score The Google Taimen has maintained to record an amazing single-core score of 1804 while the multi-core score was 6248 on Geekbench site. Also Read: Google Pixel and Pixel XL get a price cut of Rs. 13,000 The GeekBench listing does not reveal much about the device. It just speaks about the chipset and RAM integrated on the phone. Chipset used This listing does not exactly reveal the name of the processor used. It just says that the chipset will be 1.9 GHz octa-core SoC and as per the rumors, it may be powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835. Everyone are expecting this device to be something bigger in size. Rumors do say that this model may be having a display of size 6-inch or more than that. Other details revealed Other than chipset, this benchmark listing revealed some information regarding the Operating system and the RAM provided along with that. This says that the device with codename Taimen will have 4 GB of RAM and runs on the Android O which is the upcoming version of Android OS. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! There were some earlier reports claiming that the Google Taimen may not belong to the Pixel family, instead, it will be out as a tablet or a successor of Nexus 6. So, let us wait for some more time until company officially announces this device. But, we can consider this Taimen as the biggest competitor for popular handsets like Galaxy S8 because of its high-end specs.

This week, US District Court William Alsup made two decisive decisions in the lawsuit between Google’s autonomous vehicle spinoff Waymo and Uber. You know, the one accusing Levandowski of swiping 14,000 confidential documents from and taking them with him to Uber. First, Alsup rebuffed Uber’s efforts to settle the case in arbitration, so the drama will play out publicly during a trial. Waymo loved that. “We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,” it said in a statement. More troubling for Levandowski, Alsup referred the case to the US Attorney’s office “for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far.” Translated from legalese, Alsup thinks something criminal might have happened here and that the feds ought to take a look. That raises the possibility of prison time for Levandowski. Such a referral is “quite, quite rare,” says Peter Toren, an intellectual property lawyer and former Department of Justice attorney. “For a judge to do that, he must believe there’s a lot of smoke, if not fire, for criminal violations.” Things could go from bad to worse for Uber if the judge grants Waymo’s request to put the brakes on the startup’s robocar testing. As of Friday night, the court had not yet unsealed Alsup’s decision on that, so stay tuned. Uber in Trouble Aarian Marshall and Alex Davies The Scariest Threats to Uber’s Future, From Waymo to Money Worries Dan Solomon One Year After Fleeing Austin, Uber and Lyft Prepare a Fresh Invasion Cade Metz Uber Hires an AI Superstar in the Quest to Rehab Its Future Laser Fight This brouhaha started when Waymo filed the suit on February 23. Waymo claims that Levandowski illicitly downloaded 14,000 technical files, included plans for Waymo’s lidar, the laser sensor that allows autonomous vehicles to “see.” The suit alleges that Levandowski took those documents with him when he quit in early 2016 and launched the autonomous trucking outfit Otto. Uber acquired Otto for $680 million in August and put Levandowski in charge of its robocar research. Waymo claims Levandowski used its intellectual property to accelerate Uber’s program, which started about four years after Waymo’s. Two weeks after filing the suit, Waymo sought a preliminary injunction forcing Uber to stop using any technology derived from its IP, including the lidar system. This could deliver a crushing blow to Uber’s R&D, because lidar is widely seen as fundamental to the type of vehicles Uber is working on. Alsup was impressed by the evidence Waymo presented. “You have one of the strongest records I’ve seen for a long time of anybody doing something that bad,” Alsup said during a hearing last week. “Good for you.” Of course, that doesn’t mean Uber is guilty of anything, but it was enough to convince Alsup to refer all of that evidence, along with everything Uber’s counsel has gathered in the case, to the US Attorney’s office in San Francisco. We’re talking terabytes of information. You can be sure that federal prosecutors will scrutinize it all. “If you get a referral, and I did get one or two in my career, you obviously take that very seriously,” says Toren. Related Video Climb Inside Uber’s Self-Driving Car—Its Next Big Disruption If the DOJ proceeds with a criminal investigation for economic espionage, a conviction for could mean a long prison stint for Levandowski. The market value of any stolen intellectual property weighs heavily in the sentencing calculus, says Toren. “If we’re talking about tens of millions of dollars in value, we’re talking about a very, very lengthy potential prison sentence,” says Toren. Those numbers aren’t outlandish. A recent Boston Global Consulting report estimates the autonomous vehicle market could be worth tens of billions of dollars a year by 2030. Every case is different, of course, but a man recently convicted of stealing $20 million worth of trade secrets received a 15-year sentence. None of this will happen quickly. Any criminal investigation will unfold slowly, and require cooperation from Waymo—which may not want to help. The company is already locked in a public battle over secretive tech, and helping the US Attorneys Office push a criminal case means ceding all control over what is disclosed and when. “It’s sort of like the adage of dancing with the bear: The dance isn’t over until the bear says it is,” says John Marsh, a lawyer who specializes in trade secrets litigation. (The federal government is the bear here.) The Lawsuit Rolls On Uber, however, may be just fine. Even if Levandowski is convicted of a crime, Waymo’s lawyers still must prove any stolen IP made its way into Uber’s technology. So far, it hasn’t connected those dots. “I’ve given you lots of discovery, and so far you don’t have any smoking gun,” Alsup told the company’s lawyers last week. A criminal investigation could help with that, though. Prosecutors might uncover evidence during discovery, and use the threat of of subpoenas or the promise of leniency to compel testimony. Plus, “people are much more mindful of the consequences of not being truthful with federal prosecutors than lawyers in a civil case,” says Marsh. And if Levandowski is convicted, Waymo’s lawyers could present that as evidence of wrongdoing by Uber—but you can bet Uber’s lawyers would fight against that. (That said, the odds of a conviction coming before the civil trial starts in October are long indeed.) Given that federal prosecutors are involved now, Uber almost certainly will bar Levandowski from any involvement in further R&D. That’s a setback for its research, but an even bigger setback for its image (not that the company needs much help there) and recruiting. Silicon Valley fetishizes “superstar” talent, and Levandowski is among the best in the business. If he’s driving a desk for the duration, it limits Uber’s ability to attract talent, says Jonathan Matus, CEO of mobile data analytics company Zendrive. “People might ask themselves more questions than they would otherwise,” he says. He is bullish on Uber’s ability to bounce back, but there’s a lot at stake here. Failure to deliver self-driving tech poses an existential threat to Uber in the long run. Anyone getting there first, could offer a far cheaper rival service by eliminating the need to pay human drivers. “What would happen if we weren’t a part of that future? If we weren’t part of the autonomy thing? Then the future passes us by,” CEO Travis Kalanick told Business Insider last year. But moving forward is hard with federal prosecutors circling your offices. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. corporate espionage department of justice Uber Waymo Skip Social.

Puskar / Associated Press) Associated Press A federal judge has referred trade secret theft allegations made against Uber by Google's autonomous car unit to the U.S. Attorney's office for investigation. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco made the referral in an order posted Thursday night. Waymo has sued Uber alleging that the ride-hailing company is using stolen Waymo technology to develop its own self-driving vehicles. Alsup is presiding over the lawsuit. "This case is referred to the United States Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation," Alsup wrote in the order. "The court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney." Neither Uber nor Waymo would comment specifically on the judge's referral Thursday night. The high-stakes corporate espionage case revolves around Waymo's allegations that Uber's work on self-driving cars has been riding on trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing details about a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Waymo has alleged in its lawsuit that Levandowski and Uber conspired to create a sham self-driving truck startup called Otto as a prelude to a $680 million deal for Uber to buy Otto and get the desperately needed technology. After Uber bought Otto, Levandowski took over oversight of Uber's self-driving car division. He stepped down from the role earlier this month until Waymo's lawsuit is resolved. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar system is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to turn over his personal laptop or answer most other questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination. Also Thursday, Alsup issued a ruling on Waymo's request for an order to stop Uber's work on autonomous vehicles while the lawsuit is decided, but the ruling was temporarily sealed because it contained confidential information. A case synopsis said the judge granted part of Waymo's request but also denied part. In addition, Alsup denied Uber's request to force the high-tech corporate espionage lawsuit out of court and into arbitration. Alsup ruled that Waymo has taken Levandowski to arbitration, and a separate lawsuit was the only course available to sue Uber. In a statement, Waymo, part of Alphabet Inc., called Uber's arbitration request a "desperate bid" to avoid the court. "We welcome the court's decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct," the statement said. But Uber said it's unfortunate that Waymo can avoid an arbitration promise that it requires employees to make. "We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum."

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Android O could solve Android’s biggest problem Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 12th, 2017 at 9:03 PM Share Tweet For all of Android’s strengths, there’s one area where it has dramatically lagged behind iOS: updates. Fragmentation is arguably Android’s biggest problem, but in a post on the Android Developers Blog this Friday, Google revealed a new feature in Android O that will supposedly “make it easier, faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android.” Don't Miss: You can’t stop people from calling you on your Amazon Echo Google says that the new feature, dubbed Project Treble, represents “the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” As it stands, a lot of code has to be rewritten across Android before a given vendor can update its devices to the latest version of the software. With Project Treble, vendors will be able to roll out Android updates without having to wait for chip manufacturers such as Qualcomm to modify the code to work with their chips. The entire process will be streamlined so that vendors can get Android 8.0 (and beyond) in the hands of consumers more quickly than they’ve been able to in the past. That’s what Google is promising, anyway. Google has not been blind to the fragmentation issue over the past several years. The company has ensured Android users on multiple occasions that it’s working on solutions, but considering that just 7.1% of users are on Android 7.0 Nougat while nearly 20% are still on Android 4.4 KitKat, the success on this front has clearly been limited up to this point. Google says that Project Treble is already running on the Android O Developer Preview for Pixel phones, but we’ll have to wait until the new version of Android begins rolling out to judge its efficacy.

Google's latest attempt to get makers of Android phones and tablets to roll out updates faster is called Project Treble, and it's intended to remove an entire category of partners from the update pipeline. Treble, announced on Friday ahead of next week's Google I/O developers conference, will make it possible for device manufacturers like Samsung and Motorola to push OS updates to their users without waiting for an updated version of the firmware that controls the devices' chipsets. Android is an open source operating system, so phone makers are free to modify and test it to suit their hardware. That means it looks very different on each mobile device that runs it. Since Pixel phones are designed and supported by Google, they run a version of the OS with few modifications. Meanwhile, Motorola also installs skin-less versions of Android on its phones, while Samsung and Amazon tweak their version of the OS to the point that it barely resembles the version running on the Pixel. Related The Best Android Phones of 2017 The Best Android Phones of 2017 Every time there's an update, the companies not only have to ensure that it works with their modified version, but they also have to wait for chip makers like Qualcomm to ensure that it's compatible with the phone's modem, processor, and other components. Finally, they have to work with the mobile carriers to push out an update. That lengthy process means Android is woefully fragmented compared to iOS, a fragmentation that reportedly makes Google quite upset. Just 7 percent of Android users are running the latest version, Android 7.0, compared to 79 percent of iOS users who are running iOS 10. By removing the chip makers from the update process, Google hopes to speed it up. Major chip makers like Qualcomm and Sony are already on board with the Treble project, and Google says that it will roll out with the next version of Android, codenamed Android O.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google today announced Project Treble, which it hopes will solve the pain of updating smartphones to the latest version of Android. As it stands today, the process is multifaceted and includes a number of moving players, including Google, silicon makers, manufacturers, and carrier partners. The complexity of all the pieces translates into lots of time and money for the ecosystem to test, certify, and release new system builds for existing phones. Project Treble, which will work with Android O and subsequent versions of Android, rearranges how the operating system is configured at a base level in order to simplify the process. "The core concept is to separate the vendor implementation — the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers — from the Android OS Framework. This is achieved by the introduction of a new vendor interface between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. The new vendor interface is validated by a Vendor Test Suite, analogous to the CTS, to ensure forward compatibility of the vendor implementation." Put more plainly, device makers will be able to update their devices to newer versions of Android underneath their custom UI without disturbing it, and without requiring help from silicon manufacturers. Google says some aspects of Project Treble are already included in the Developer Preview of O running on Pixel phones. The company plans to work with its silicon and device partners to ensure a smooth transition to the new architecture for future phones. Google expects to release full details of Project Treble with the launch of Android O later this summer. more info at Google » Related Oppo Makes Near-Stock Android Available to Some Phones Oppo today began offering customers an alternative to its ColorOS.

(Angelo Merendino/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) By Elizabeth Dwoskin By Elizabeth Dwoskin May 12 at 9:06 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin SAN FRANCISCO — The stakes are getting higher in a trade secrets case that pits two of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies against each other in a battle over the future of self-driving cars. A judge asked federal prosecutors Thursday to investigate whether Uber Technologies and one of its executives colluded to steal key technology from Google’s self-driving car project, now known as Waymo, before the executive joined Uber last year. The possibility of an investigation adds to mounting issues facing Uber and its embattled chief executive, Travis Kalanick. The ride-hailing giant, which is valued by private investors at nearly $70 billion, is also facing a criminal probe by the Justice Department over the company’s use of software that was designed to evade authorities in cities where Uber was not yet legal. That criminal investigation is ongoing, according to people familiar with the matter. “It is very rare for a judge to refer a matter over to the U.S. attorney and signals the judge’s displeasure with Uber in the trade secrets civil lawsuit,” said Carl Tobias Williams, chair in law at the University of Richmond School of Law. It also compounds Uber’s other legal problems, he said in an interview Friday. In referring the case to the U.S. attorney’s office, the court took “no position on whether prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney,” U.S. District Judge William Alsup wrote. In addition, Alsup denied Uber’s request to move the case to arbitration. That means the high-profile case is expected to go to public trial later this year. Waymo filed the lawsuit in February. Alsup also temporarily blocked part of Uber’s self-driving program using technology that Waymo claims to be stolen, but it was unclear how much of the program would be suspended because documents of the partial injunction were sealed. Uber did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Waymo commented on the decision to go to trial in an emailed statement Thursday: “This was a ­desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court’s jurisdiction. We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber ­responsible in court for its misconduct.” Uber has long been celebrated in Silicon Valley for its hard-charging culture — and for its strategy of moving into cities ­before getting permission from authorities. Within the tech world, Uber’s success was emblematic of the promise of a new wave of “on-demand” start-ups that would use smartphone-based technology to transform entrenched businesses in the physical world. Technology companies Uber and Waymo, along with Detroit automakers, are in a cutthroat race to develop self-driving technology, which they think could define the future of transportation in the United States. Uber executive Anthony Levandowski allegedly downloaded 14,000 documents to his personal computer before quitting his job last January as an executive with Google. Waymo claims that Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal lidar technology, a laser that helps software gauge the proximity of objects. Levandowski recently stepped aside as the head of Uber’s self-driving car program, though he remains with the ­company. Google, which launched a self-driving program in 2009, now has a fleet of more than 100 test vehicles that have driven 3 million miles on city streets in Phoenix, Austin and Mountain View, Calif. (The testing rules require that autonomous vehicles have humans in the car). Uber began testing autonomous technology seven years later. The ride-hailing company has cars in San Francisco, Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz. For privately held Uber, self-driving vehicles have the potential to cut the expense of human drivers; lowering such costs is seen by some investors as a prerequisite for a public offering. Losing the race to develop the technology first would make Uber vulnerable to competitors and potentially decimate its business. And the company’s culture has been called into question this year. Uber has seen a string of high-profile executive departures following a controversy over sexual harassment and discrimination. The earlier criminal probe focuses on software developed by Uber called Greyball. The program helped the company evade officials in cities where Uber was not yet approved. The software blocked rides to transportation regulators who were posing as Uber customers to prove that the company was operating illegally. The company said it was used to deny ride requests from fraudulent users. business economy true Please provide a valid email address. Sign up You’re all set!

An update rolling out today to Google Maps is making it even easier to arrive smoothly at your destination by allowing users to see exactly where to turn and what lane to be in using Street View images… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases First noticed by Android Police, version 9.52.2 of Google Maps introduces several design tweaks including the addition of the Street View images. The biggest downside of this new feature is the fact that it isn’t available when you’re using navigation. Street View images only appear after you’ve inputted your destination and before you tap on start. At the bottom of the screen, you can select route info which will populate a list of step-by-step directions accompanied by small image thumbnails. Only by clicking on the thumbnail will the full-sized Street View image appear. While this can be helpful before you start your trip, it would be more useful if the picture popped up right before you had to make a turn so that you could see exactly where you needed to be heading. Also in this update is a small change to the bottom navigation bar. This change makes the section slightly larger than the outgoing design, but it does make everything a little more intuitive for users. For example, instead of assuming that someone knows that swiping up offered additional options, Google has now labeled a button as “More info.” The latest version of Google Maps is rolling out now on the Google Play Store. If you don’t want to wait for it to hit your device, you can download the APK for version 9.52.2 from APKMirror. Make sure to read our guide on manually installing APKs if you need any help.

Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google I/O 2017: What to Expect By Tyler Lee on 05/12/2017 16:50 PDT Google I/O 2016 So far every year for the past few years without fail Google has hosted its annual Google I/O event, and this year the company is back with the 2017 version. Just like Microsoft’s BUILD conferences or Apple’s WWDC, Google I/O is mostly about software and services, where Google will introduce new software and potentially launch new services for its customers to check out, and we expect that this year will be no different. So below is a list of everything that you might be able to expect from the event which will be taking place from the 17th-19th of May, 2017. Android O Right off the bat we guess the biggest and most obvious thing we can expect Google to talk about at Google I/O would be Android O. This is Google’s latest update on its Android operating system and as it stands, a version number and its name (apart from the designated “O”) has yet to be revealed. A handful of features of Android O have trickled out ever since its developer preview was released, but we expect a more formal introduction at the event. Android Auto Android Auto is Google’s attempt at trying to bring a version of Android into cars and its infotainment systems. We’ve seen Google introduce various new features and updates to the platform, such as integrating Waze in Android Auto, so perhaps we’ll learn more about the future of the platform at the event. Android Wear This topic is a little tricky. Android Wear 2.0 was announced last year at Google I/O 2016, but due to several delays, the update was only just released to Android Wear smartwatches a couple of months ago. With the update being this fresh in everyone’s mind, we’re not sure if Google will even touch on Android Wear 3.0 so soon. Chrome OS One of the bigger changes that Google has done to its Chrome OS platform is giving it the ability to run Android apps. There have been talks about Google possibly merging Chrome OS and Android into a unified platform, but that has since been denied, with Google’s Hiroshi Lockheimer stating that both platforms are successful in their own regard and that merging them together doesn’t make sense. Earlier this year Google also hinted at the possibility that Chrome OS could be arriving in other form factors so maybe at I/O we’ll be able to get a taste of what’s to come. Google Home Google Home was launched last year and we expect that Google is probably working on a successor. Following Amazon’s launch of smaller and more compact Echo speakers, and also the Echo Show which comes with a touchscreen display, we wouldn’t be surprised if Google had a newer, smaller, and maybe touch-sensitive version of Home in the works as well. Google Assistant While voice assistants have existed on Android for the longest time ever, the launch of Google Assistant and seeing it integrated into various Google apps and services suggests that Google has bigger plans for the platform. Right now Google Assistant has made its way out of the Pixel phones and onto non-Pixel handsets, so we expect that Google will share more plans for the future of the software. Virtual Reality/Daydream Google’s interest in virtual reality and augmented reality aren’t new. Last year when the Pixel handsets launched, they were Google’s first Daydream-ready handsets and we wouldn’t be surprised if Google were to announce more partners that would be launching Daydream-ready devices. Let’s not forget Google’s recent acquisition of VR developers Owlchemy Labs, where hopefully the company will share some of their plans with what they plan to do with the acquisition in terms of hardware or software. Augmented Reality The Google Glass is Google’s answer to augmented reality and while the project was previously scrapped and rebooted, we haven’t really heard much about it since. Could Google have something to show us this year? Although with Google shutting down Glass-related social media accounts, it certainly doesn’t seem that way, but we’ll keep our fingers crossed. Project Tango Google unveiled Project Tango a couple of years ago, although it was only last year that a phone with the actual technology was launched in the form of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Following that we saw ASUS launch a similar handset in the form of the ASUS ZenFone AR, and last we heard a new Lenovo Project Tango phone could also be in the works for 2017 which could be shown off at I/O 2017. Self-driving Cars While Google’s self-driving car efforts have been spun-off into a separate company in the form of Waymo, it is possible that Google could share what they’ve learnt so far from their efforts, maybe share some statistics and what the plans are moving forward, or maybe they’ll even give I/O attendees a demonstration of the self-driving cars in action. So this is what we think you could expect from Google I/O 2017. Some of them are pretty much a given, like Android O, but some are based on what we’ve seen Google talk about in the past, as well as some speculation and even hope of what to expect. This means that there is no guarantee that what is mentioned here will be announced at the event, but either way we will be covering the event so remember to check back with us from the 17th-19th of May for the details.

Box 964, Chiloquin, OR 97624 ← This Guy BLISTERS TV Audience With Massive Truth Bombs! Why do ISIS Videos All come from Israeli Intelligence? → Google’s Newest High-Res Satellites Can Monitor Your Every Move … In Real Time Posted on May 11, 2017 by Admin Sent to us by a reader. Off the Grid News – by Sean Shado When Google Earth first debuted in 2005, privacy advocates reacted by overwhelmingly rejecting the new satellite imagery platform. Google Earth provides the public with the ability to access satellite pictures of any coordinates just by simply dragging the mouse. This gross invasion of privacy can involuntarily give the world a glimpse at your home, your belongings and your surroundings. Google Street View pushed the boundaries of personal privacy even further by providing a street-side picture of your home or business for the world to see.   In some circumstances, Google Earth and Street View are tools that have immensely helped people gain their bearing in a foreign place. Defenders of Google Earth and Street View argued that regulations surrounding satellite and street view images being posted on the Internet made it difficult for malicious people to get anything of value from the images. These regulations required that some portions of the pictures be blurred out. Other regulations mentioned that certain photography resolution thresholds must not be breached. While these regulations seemed like a fair compromise, the United States government has instituted a change which suddenly loosened the regulations surrounding satellite imagery policies. These loosened regulations have resulted in companies such as Google now being able to display ultra-high definition photographs in near real-time, online – displaying resolution as small as one foot. In fact, Google recently acquired Skybox imaging for $500 million in order to jumpstart its live satellite imagery endeavors. Skybox’s plan is to have 24 satellites circling the earth at all times by 2018. Wired magazine notes that “With six small satellites orbiting Earth, Skybox could provide practically real-time images of the same spot twice a day at a fraction of the current cost.” While this innovation could stand to become Google’s next billion dollar revenue stream, the model presents all kinds of problems for those who value privacy. The Impact of Ultra-High Resolution Satellite Imagery The notion of having a satellite being able to photograph your house with an ultra high resolution camera twice per day is the epitome of Big Brother. Subsequently having it broadcast on the Internet for the world to see is a gross invasion of personal privacy. If you live in a densely populated urban area, you may have more than two pictures per day being published online. Real time high definition satellite imagery will definitely be helpful if you must navigate against heavy rush hour traffic in an urban area. Those who enjoy living on the grid can see obvious advantages for this technology. Privacy-minded individuals have an entirely different perception of Google Skybox. While current images on Google Maps can display images of your house and car, Skybox can show detail about your house and car – for instance, if you have a satellite dish, if you have a mailbox, what you’re eating at that outdoor picnic (pizza?), and even how many children are playing in your yard. And it can do this virtually in real-time. “If you imagine a satellite sat above your office then the old resolution could probably make out your desk. The new imagery – where each pixel measures around 31 centimeters (12 inches) – can now make out what’s on your desk,” Clive Evans, lead satellite imagery investigator with LGC Forensics, told the Independent. “When you reach this sort of frequency you can begin to add in what we call ‘pattern of life’ analysis. This means looking at activity in terms of movement – not just identification.” Image source: DailyTech.com Let’s face it: Google SkyBox is a dream come true for the criminal underworld. Any stalker, burglar or any other sort of criminal now has instant access to a frequently updated aerial feed of your home. A sophisticated group of criminals could theoretically target your home using data gathered from the ultra high resolution satellite photos being published by Google. Instead of driving through your neighborhood, criminals could canvass your house daily without ever stepping foot inside your neighborhood. Sophisticated criminals could potentially be able to determine when you are normally at home or when you’re typically away. Criminals who are able to take an analytical approach to this intrusion of privacy could even canvass your entire neighborhood and base their attacks on all the data they have accumulated. Seedy individuals from the underworld can build databases that tell them when your neighbors are typically at home and when they are away. These efforts are used to determine when the least amount of people will be at their homes during certain periods of time. This gives criminals a time window of when they can show up and perform their malicious intentions while minimizing their risks of being seen or caught. The loosened regulations on satellite images can give anyone an amazing amount of detail on the area they have selected on the map. Experts mention that they are able to examine the high resolution pictures taken by SkyBox satellites and determine the make and model of vehicles that are sitting in parking lots. Governments and Big Corporations Want The Data, Too This creepy new technology supersedes any privacy fears that consumers held against Google Maps back in 2005. These real time public images can become key data points that indicate more granular details about places around the world, including the economic health within a specific region. Corporate executives who have chosen to remain nameless have admitted that they have already begun devising methods to make use of this data.   Governments all around the world – even small countries with no satellites — will now have access to a rich continuous stream of events happening in real time. With SkyBox’s high resolution satellite on the cheap option, these smaller countries can now monitor events as they happen rather than having to rely on unconfirmed reports from senior officials or news agencies. Nations such as the US stand to gain little from Google’s endeavors because the US government already possesses this technology. The only difference is that SkyBox costs a fraction of what the government paid to develop technology of this same caliber. The data that Google SkyBox brings to the table is clearly game-changing because it ensures that an up-to-date high resolution picture of a home or business is being broadcast online for anyone to see. If you do not want your home or property on it, it may be possible – once it is rolled out — for you to ask Google to blur out your property on search results. This option was available in the original Google Earth. Only time will tell. http://www.offthegridnews.com/privacy/googles-newest-high-res-satellites-can-monitor-your-every-move-in-real-time/ Share this: Print Email Share on Tumblr Tweet Pocket This entry was posted in News.

Why do ISIS Videos All come from Israeli Intelligence? → 3 Responses to Google’s Newest High-Res Satellites Can Monitor Your Every Move … In Real Time BMF says: May 11, 2017 at 6:43 pm TL;DR version of my post below: There’s a bit of a privacy threat here, but not much more than already existed. The headline is an exaggeration, at least for now. Long version: *** Wired magazine notes that “With six small satellites orbiting Earth, Skybox could provide practically real-time images of the same spot twice a day at a fraction of the current cost.” *** I’m not sure what “real-time, twice a day” means. Most likely what’s happening is each satellite is taking still images at some constant rate as it flies around the earth — maybe one snapshot every several minutes? Some of those shots may overlap a bit. But twice per day isn’t very often, and short flyover time is a major weakness of satellite surveillance. For example, if a satellite is orbiting at the equator twice per day, the area being imaged on the ground is traveling at about 2000 mph. Even if that imaging area is huge, you won’t be under it for long. 12-inch resolution? That’s actually pretty terrible. No way are they going to be able to distinguish one person from another with that. They might not even be able to see people at all, or at least not reliably. You’re talking about every pixel on the image being a 1-foot-by-1-foot block. Most people are only about 2 feet wide. These are the reasons why the Empire relies so much on drones and other aircraft for surveillance, even though it has satellites as well. Their satellites can’t loiter long enough, and they just can’t make out enough detail. The poor resolution is partly due to inherent limits in optics based on aperture size, and also due to atmospheric distortion, which I understand can only be partially corrected with adaptive optics. (This is why some astronomical telescopes have been put into space.) Cloud cover, too, can block visible light, though some satellites can take (STILL) photos through the clouds using imaging radar. Reply 'ol stew bum says: May 12, 2017 at 7:05 am The Amazing Google Earth was instrumental in the local tax assessor’s re-evaluation of my property. “It is apparent that you have added a room to the back of your house. We are offering amnesty for the building permit violations for a $100 non-refundable fee.” Quite a racket they have going here.

Name: Subject: Message: Android O’s Project Treble could lead to faster OS updates for smartphones Newsby John Callaham7 hours ago 3 328 39 Some Android smartphones, even ones that are consider flagship devices, can be slow in receiving big OS updates. Today, Google announced an effort designed to speed up that device update process called Project Treble. It will be a part of the upcoming Android O operating system and in fact is already included in the current developer preview. See also: How stable is the first Android O Developer Preview? April 6, 2017 Google states that in current and previous versions of Android, any updates for the OS are first sent to silicon companies like Qualcomm, MediaTek and others, who make changes to the OS so it can work on their hardware. Then that version is sent to device makers like Samsung, LG, HTC and others, who make their own changes for their specific products. If a device is tied to a carrier, such as AT&T or Verizon, the OS update must then make their way to those companies for final changes and testing. This is why Android updates from Google can sometimes take months, or longer, to reach your smartphone. Google says having such an interface will give device makers direct access to the hardware-specific parts of Android O. With the launch of Android O, Google wanted to cut that update time with Project Treble. It has done this with the creation of a new vendor interface that will be between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. What does this mean? Google says having such an interface will give device makers direct access to the hardware-specific parts of Android O. In theory, this should allow those companies to update their Android smartphones and tablets directly, without the need to go through their silicon partners first. In addition to Project Treble, Google is also working with its Android device hardware partners to directly implement any of their code changes into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. This means that when a new version of Android O is released, those code changes won’t need to be patched by those companies. All of this sounds extremely promising, especially if you buy a phone and then have to wait a long time for promised OS updates. Hopefully, these new moves by Google will speed up this process for Android O device owners. We will learn a lot more about Android O next week as part of the 2017 Google I/O developer conference.

(Plus answers to other popular Google searches) When you're searching for answers, Google's autosuggest feature lets you know what other people are looking for when they start with the same search terms. In this week's installment of our Google Autosuggest series, we provide some answers to the most popular queries about Microsoft's cloud-based productivity suite. By Ed Bott for The Ed Bott Report | May 12, 2017 -- 23:32 GMT (16:32 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software Image: Microsoft News Google's autosuggest feature lets you know, sometimes with spooky accuracy, what other people are looking for when conducting queries similar to yours. So, with Google's help, we provide answers to a few of the most popular searches about Microsoft Office 365. What's the difference between Office 365 and Office 2016? Office 365 is a subscription service that includes a combination of online services and apps. The exact lineup varies, depending on which subscription you have. Office 2016 is the branding for the desktop apps that run on PCs and Macs. The most popular Office 365 subscriptions include the right to download those apps on multiple devices after you sign in using the credentials associated with your subscription. No product keys are required and you can easily transfer licenses between devices.

(And more top Google queries answered) Windows 10 editions: Everything you need to know You can also buy a perpetual license for Office 2016 as a retail package. This product doesn't include any of the online services, and you need to enter a product key and activate it before using it. The official answer is here. Which apps are in Office 365? Are Visio and Project included? If you have an Office 365 Home, Personal, Business, or Business Premium subscription, you have the right to download and install a package that includes the following desktop programs: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote. On PCs (but not Macs), you also get Publisher and Access. Microsoft Visio and Microsoft Project are both members of the extended Office family but are not included in any Office 365 subscription. You need to purchase licenses for those products and install them separately. Pay special attention to the installer technology if you want to use the Click-to-Run version of the Office 365 apps with Visio or Project. This how-to article has some useful links. Can you use Office 365 on an iPad? You can download and install the Office 365 mobile apps for iOS and run them on an iPad, iPad Pro, or iPad Mini. Ed Bott's 10 most popular Windows 10 tip... SEE FULL GALLERY 1 - 5 of 10 NEXT PREV If you have an Office 365 subscription, you can sign in to those apps to unlock their full feature set. Five apps are available, all of them installed individually: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook. They're not the same as the full-featured desktop apps available for Windows PCs and Macs, but they do a good job of maintaining file compatibility when you edit documents on a PC that were created on an iPad or vice-versa. Can you use Office 365 offline? All of the Office 365 subscriptions include the ability to use web-based versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Outlook. Those web apps require an internet connection to work properly. If you install the Office 2016 desktop or mobile apps, you can create and edit files offline. If those files are stored in OneDrive or OneDrive for Business, any changes you make will be synchronized to the cloud when you reconnect to the Internet. Does Office 365 let you host a website? Until recently, Office 365 Business and Enterprise subscriptions included the capability to create a SharePoint Online public website. Effective May 1, Microsoft has ended that feature, and any existing public websites will be deleted as of September 1, 2017. For details, see this support document.

Leisure Home LBoard Mahathir concedes BN will win 3-cornered fights FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Google takes Owlchemy Labs under its wing AFP Relaxnews | May 13, 2017 Owlchemy Labs, the studio behind VR's notable slapstick comedy "Job Simulator," has become part of Google, intending to continue making things that are "absurd, highly polished, and filled to the brim with terrible puns & jokes." The Austin, Texas team at Owlchemy Labs made its name developing driving game “Smuggle Truck,” a plushy-themed analogue “Snuggle Truck,” and tree-chopping action title “Jack Lumber” for mobile and PC. It made four games in the base-jumping franchise “AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!!,” two of which have been oriented towards virtual reality experiences (one being for Google’s Cardboard standard for Android, the other Facebook’s Oculus Rift for high-powered PCs), and conversation-driven survival riff “Dyscourse” before plunging further into VR through “Job Simulator” (HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, PlayStation VR) and then Adult Swim’s licensed “Rick & Morty Virtual Rick-ality.” “‘Job Simulator’ was our overnight success many years in the making. We pushed in VR so early and so hard,” explained Owlchemy co-founders Alex Schwartz and Devin Reimer who, together with their team, “spent over a year envisioning what was possible with a tracked head and hands” (owlchemylabs.com). “Together with Google, with which we share an incredible overlap in vision, we’re free to pursue raw creation and sprint toward interesting problems in these early days of VR,” their company announcement concluded. “We cannot freaking wait to show you what we’re concocting next.” Google explained the acquisition in terms of its own VR portfolio, which includes video platform YouTube, Street View, Photos on Daydream, Google Earth VR and painting app Tilt Brush. “Together, we’ll be working to create engaging, immersive games and developing new interaction models across many different platforms to continue bringing the best VR experiences to life,” wrote Google’s VR and AR Director of Engineering, Relja Markovic (blog.google).

It took a mere three hours for Google to blacklist the offending web app; the next day, Google rolled out an update for Gmail to better warn users about phishing links. Today, the Mountain View giant has announced an update to its approach with regards to the publishing process for web apps that request user data. The company notes that while its API’s user data policy states that “apps must not mislead users” and that their names “should be unique to [the] application and should not copy others”, the process of enforcing this policy have been lackluster. To fix that, Google is updating its web app publishing process, its risk assessment systems, as well as the user-facing consent page for apps. As far as the average user is concerned – nothing changes. But, developers might notice delays in publishing or modifying their web apps. As an example, subject to how the new risk assessment process feels about a web app, some web apps might require a manual review by Google before publishing publicly. Developers will have to manually request said review during an app’s testing phase, and Google may take up to 7 days to give its nod; until approved, the app will only work for the owner, editor, and additional testers. The average user will not be able to provide permission to use their data until an app has been approved. These changes are sure to help prevent a repeat of such phishing attacks. Google didn’t state if any more changes were coming to the user-facing consent page, but hopefully, a change to highlight the app publisher’s name more prominently is in the works.

Search engine major Google has been granted an Indian patent for an invention related to an informational retrieval system that uses phrases to index, search, rank and describe documents in the document collection. The system is adapted to identify phrases that have sufficiently frequent and distinguished usage to indicate that they are valid or good phrases. Google claims the system avoids the problem of having to identify and index every possible phrase resulting from the combination of all of the possible sequences of a given number of words. Google had filed the patent application titled ‘phrase identification in an information retrieval system’ in 2005 at the Kolkata patent office. Nirmalya Sinha, deputy controller of patents & design, Kolkata, while granting the patent observed the technical solution, that is, the index consisting of good phrases that enables documents with related concepts to be provided in response to a query, is a technical advancement over the prior art. According to a patent document filed by Google, the phrase spotting operation identifies good and bad phrases in the document collection that are useful to indexing and searching documents. Good phrases are phrases that tend to occur in more than certain percentage of documents in the document collection and are indicated to as having a distinguished appearance in such documents. Another aspect of good phrases is that they are predictive and are not merely sequences of words that appear in the lexicon, the company submitted. Citing example to describe how the invention is useful, Google said the phrase ‘President of United States’ predicts other phrases such as George Bush and Bill Clinton. However, other phrases are not predictive, such as ‘fell down the stairs’ or ‘top of the morning’, ‘out of the blue’, since idioms and colloquisms like these tend to appear with different and unrelated phrases. You may also like to watch this video Arguing for the patent, the company said that the invention is neither a mathematical algorithm nor a computer programme per se, but provides a technical solution to a technical problem of how to automatically identify phrases in a document collection. It also helps to determine groups of phrases that identify or relate to a single concept. The end product, which is an index stored in a memory that includes valid phrases, is inventive, the company said. No Comments.

It's more aesthetically pleasing and a breeze to use, but not so simple to share. Image from Google Google has a new feature in its latest update for Google Allo, an instant messaging mobile app released last September for Android and iOS users: selfie stickers — a custom caricature created by using a photo of any given user. The technology behind this feature (currently only available for Android users) makes for a unique experience. Google is utilising machine learning and neural networks "to analyse the pixels of an image and algorithmically determine attribute values by looking at pixel values to measure colour, shape, or texture." Essentially, the app creates a cartoon sticker, illustrated by storyboard artist Lamar Abrams, that actually resembles what you look like. Something similar already exists The general concept is an awful lot like Bitmoji — a personal emoji spin-off app created by Bitstrips in 2014. But Google's selfie sticker has a leg up on Bitmoji when it comes to being user-friendly and streamlining the emoji creation process. Bitmoji's cartoon avatars rely on users selecting features for themselves. This is great for personalisation, as everything from wardrobe and body type to eyebrows and headgear can be customised. But it also leaves it to the user to hand-pick what they think they look like. And let's face it — we're often not the best judges of our own appearance. If you're going for accuracy, Bitmojis leave a lot to be desired. With Google's selfie sticker, the app does all the legwork behind emoji creation for you. So if you're distraught over which pair of eyes best represents your own, worry no more — Allo is here to capture your true self. How Allo's selfie sticker works Within the Allo app, you take a selfie and receive a cartoon within seconds. Then you can customise your face to make minor changes where the neural network may have slipped up. When all is said and done, you have 22 custom selfie stickers — and they look really good. That's a stark difference from the process of creating a Bitmoji, where you have to handpick every aspect of your appearance. Regardless of whether you opt for Bitmoji or Bistrips style, the final result is significantly less aesthetically pleasing than Allo's sticker. Here's the issue When you look at the quality of the personalised emoji and the process to create it, Allo is the clear winner for the consumer. But there's one major limitation with Allo's selfie sticker: it only works within the Allo messaging app. Bitmoji, on the other hand, can be shared through SMS text message, iMessage, Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Gmail, Messenger, Slack and other messaging platforms. Users can also link Bitmoji with their Snapchat account — the app boasts 166 million daily active users and is a favourite among millennials. Allo hasn't really taken off: it secured 10 million downloads at the end of last year, which pales in comparison to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger's 1.2 billion monthly active users. By limiting the selfie sticker to Allo, Google is restricting its potential to the pool of users that actually use the messaging app on a regular basis. For the user, this means you can't really show off your cool new selfie sticker with anyone but fellow Allo users unless you screenshot, crop and send the sticker as a picture. Chances are, Google is hoping to boost Allo's active users by offering selfie stickers but the company may be doing the feature (and the technology supporting it) an injustice by not creating a standalone app for it. Or, at the very least, it should do its users a solid and let them share the selfie stickers across various different platforms. For the user, as it stands currently, Allo's personal emoji is easier to make and delivers a better product, but it falls short in its shareability.

Pre-order: Surface Laptop Apps for those jumping ship Android apps every Windows Mobile convert should install right away By Richard Devine Friday, May 12, 2017 at 9:00 am EDT 127 Comments It's all about the apps, right? If you've just jumped from Windows Mobile to Android, these are the first apps you should download. We all love Windows 10 Mobile, but we're also realists. The sad truth is that many of the Windows faithful are jumping ship to other mobile platforms such as Android, and with that comes a number of challenges. Thankfully, apps aren't one of them, because the Google Play Store is well stocked with everything you could want on your phone. But it can be overwhelming at first, so we singled out a selection of apps that we recommend every Windows Mobile convert installs first. Microsoft Apps If you're going to be keeping all your Microsoft services and accounts intact (why wouldn't you?), you'll be happy to know Android is your friend. Whether you just want to use Outlook, Office or Skype, or go nuts and install Microsoft's own Android launcher and lockscreen, there's a ton of Microsoft apps in the Play Store. And they're mostly pretty darn good. You won't have to cancel Groove. You can still get the Xbox app. And your Outlook mail and calendars are safe. Better yet, Microsoft has a single app to help you find and download all of its other apps. Download Microsoft Apps from the Google Play Store Beam If you're getting into Beam since Microsoft acquired it, you'll be pleased to know that there's already an official app for Android available in the Play Store. Considering there isn't even an official app for Windows 10 outside of Xbox One, this is a happy bonus for new Android converts. It's a fairly basic experience targeted at viewing streams above anything else, but it's an experience nevertheless. And you can watch the Windows Central Podcast live every week, wherever you are! Download Beam from the Google Play Store Google Opinion Rewards This app is literally an essential for anyone using Android. It's basically free money to spend in the Play Store on apps, games, music and video content. All you do is install it, and every so often you'll be given an anonymous survey to answer that rewards you with Google Play credit. You don't get a lot of money per survey, but as they keep rolling in you'll soon build up a healthy balance. Unless you hate free stuff, there's no reason not to use it. Download Google Opinion Rewards from the Play Store Enpass Enpass is our favorite password manager for Windows 10, and it's available and as awesome on Android. Assuming you use something to sync your passwords across devices, simply download and login to Enpass on Android, and you'll be up and running in no time. Enpass also, like on Windows 10, supports fingerprint readers, for easy access without having to enter your master password every time. Download Enpass from the Google Play Store Windows Central and Android Central If you want to keep tabs on the best of Microsoft, as well as learn a whole lot about Android, Mobile Nations (our parent company) has apps for you.

Look, I am just as sad as you are that W10M is on its death bed. With any luck Microsoft will kill it and introduce full windows 10 on phone devices. But until then the reality is the best of microsoft is found on iOS and Android. Even this current BUILD conference has shown that. -1 12 hours ago Reply poit57 But until then the reality is the best of microsoft is found on iOS and Android. After trying to make the switch to Android and following all these articles to set up the Microsoft apps, I completely disagree that the best of Microsoft can be found on Android. The Cortana app is not as functional as it is on Windows, and seems to be handicapped by not being part of the Android OS. Groove is only for streaming music. I prefer to have my music stored locally and not rely on cellular data to play my music, which I always have playing in my car. When I have streamed music from my OneDrive storage, the app doesn't remember where I left off like the Windows version does. Music controls pop up on the Android lock screen, but they don't respond when I tap the play or skip button. Outlook email can't be used like I do on Windows - linked inbox for all personal email accounts and separate inbox for work email individually pinned to the start screen for direct access. This makes it easy to know when I have a work email awaiting a response without having to sift through all my personal emails. I have to use a separate app for one of those inboxes in order to replicate that usage on Android. While the Outlook app can be set as the default email, there is not an easy way to incorporate the Outlook calendar into the main system. I can either have my Google calendar subscribe to the Outlook calendar for a read-only view of upcoming events, or I have to open the Outlook app to access the calendar to view and add new events. Same for upcoming events and birthdays in Facebook - I have to have the Google calendar subscribe via URL to see those events whereas they easily show up in the calendar on Windows by flipping a toggle in the Facebook app.   1 11 hours ago Reply bub78 Theres an app called Nine that does excellent outlook mail/calendar integration -1 11 hours ago Reply bub78 Nine for exchange integration. I like HERE maps better than Google Maps. Textra is a nice SMS app with dark theme. Podcast Addict is a good podcast app. DigiCal is a calendar app that does the week view just like outlook calendar did on W10M. Arrow launcher is also a must. Then there are the apps W10M doesn't have: SlingTV, MLB at Bat, Vanguard, banking & cc apps, the Starbucks app can do mobile ordering which is great, Amazon, PIA VPN though it eats battery so I don't leave it on much. There's also a great app called Import SMS From Windows Phone which does exactly what it says and was super useful for the switch. Many more. -1 12 hours ago Reply Richard_CC One of the windows phone USPs was Here Maps, you can download whole countries/regions so you don't have to use data to have gps navigation. In fact you only need data for traffic updates, so if you are in another country with expensive roaming you just turn data off.   Here maps has rebranded as "Here We Go" and is availble free on Android.  It has ads but not intrusive.  Recomemnded. 0 12 hours ago Reply Richard Loveridge Considering Windows on ARM is coming this year its pretty weird this.

Personally ill stay with my perfectly acceptable Lumia 950 and only upgrade to a Pocket PC in the next 18 months. 0 12 hours ago Reply Sarang68 I am very much happy with my 950xl. Thanks but no thanks. Will keep using every Windows Phone in India. Not touching Alphabet with a bargepole 2 12 hours ago Reply DJCBS Before I recommend some, just to point out that Google Rewards is NOT available worldwide. So don't even bother if you live outside these countries: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States. ____ That said here are the ones I recommend: Nova Launcher: Don't even bother with your OEM's launcher. You will want to use Nova. You can replicate almost any UI there and because you're most likely going to jump from OEM to OEM depending on what they offer each year, Nova is the best way to ensure that you will NEVER have any adaption pains when switching since your own designed UI will transition.   (Alt.) SquareHome 2: If you're a fan of the tiles interface of Windows Phone and you really really don't want to give that up, SquareHome 2 will replicate it for you, live tiles included (plus widgets). Not only that, it allows you to expand the functionality of the tile interface (that left side panel you always wanted for some things? You can add it there).   LastPass: an alternative to Enpass. Does exactly the same things with the advantage of also being available for WP8. Oh and unlike Enpass, it's free (there's a premium version available should you want it, but the apps are not paid).   BlackPlayer EX: Let's face it, Groove on Android is a disaster (I mean...it's not like on Windows it's any better...WMP still beats it). And Google Play Music has one of the ugliest UIs you can think of. So if you want a great music player, I strongly recommend BlackPlayer EX. Not only is the interface great and filled with customisation possibilities, but if you ever wondered from where has Microsoft been "borrowing" their UI ideas for Groove, then you'll see it from where.   QuickPic: A photos folder that allows you to organise everything, allows you do also add in cloud accounts to fetch features from, included a photo editor...and all of this for free.   TV Series: If you love your series and use to love the WP app "TVShow" by Rudy, this is the best equivalent you'll find on Android. In fact, it's actually superior to it (since TVShow was canned).   Amazon Underground: because often Amazon offers you paid apps for free through their store, something that never happens on the Play Store. So...why not have it around just in case? 1 12 hours ago Reply Tarkus13 Amazon Underground has been discontinued, I believe. 0 12 hours ago Reply DJCBS Nop. It most defnitely hasn't. Perhaps you're confusing it with the fact that Google forced Amazon to remove it from the Play Store? 'cause that's what happened. However, you can get the apk directly from Amazon and it's continuously updated. 0 11 hours ago Reply Tarkus13 Do a search for "amazon underground discontinued" and you'll see plenty of articles about it. It hasn't happened yet, but they're no longer accepting apps after the end of this month, and will be shutting down the service altogether this summer. 0 10 hours ago Reply DJCBS That's incorrect. What they will be shutting down is the "Actually Free Program", and NOT Amazon Underground itself. They will only stop accepting new apps for this program on the 31st of May 2017 and support for the AFP will only be over in 2019. See details here https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/appstore/post/cbadeae1-990d-4d52-bef5...     1 10 hours ago Reply fuzzylumpkin To be fair, they were right to remove it. The Amazon underground app a you to sideload apps... That's why it was removed. I've got no issue with sideloading, I have underground and f-droid installed, but apps that facilitate the installation of potentially unsafe third party apps shouldn't be in there. 0 10 hours ago Reply DJCBS Let's not be naïve though. Google just did that because they didn't want people to get Android apps from somewhere else and lose the revenue from people using the Play Store. The Amazon App store is as secure if not more secure than Google's own Play Store. But it's competition. It's just like Apple not wanting apps that promote competing platforms on the iOS Store. 0 10 hours ago Reply VictorKenya I'm still contented with my Lumia 540 running windows 10 CU. Maybe I will jump to android when Windows mobile will be completely dead. 0 12 hours ago Reply vk1971 You can start to prepare 0 9 hours ago Reply poit57 I just bought an Android phone to see if I could make the switch. After a week, I'm returning this phone and going back to my Lumia 950. Even with the Microsoft apps installed and the access I now have to a few other apps that aren't on Windows, I'm not enjoying the overall experience. The customization allowed on Android almost feels like a detriment rather than a positive - even basic things like the phone dialer. There are so many dialer apps to choose from, but with me using AT&T service and not having an AT&T-branded phone, I have to use a completely separate app to access my visual voicemail. Without the AT&T visual voicemail app, the phone app that came with the phone doesn't even notify me that I have a new voicemail waiting. Not that I get voicemails often, but the fact that this basic use of the phone isn't so basic frustrates me. The Cortana and Outlook app experience don't live up to my expectations either. On Windows, I have my linked inbox of personal emails and my work email inbox separately pinned to the start screen for easy access and notifications of new mail. As far as I can tell, there isn't a way to do this on Android without using a completely separate email client app for one of the two inboxes. While the Outlook Calendar app for windows easily integrates all calendars I sign into, including Gmail, iCloud, and Facebook, Google's calendar app doesn't seem to play as nicely. I can either have my Google account subscribe to my Outlook calendar for a read-only view of events, or I have to go into the Outlook mail app to access my Outlook calendar where it offers no integration into the operating system. 4 11 hours ago Reply Tarkus13 X-plore file manager is a must have for me.

District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco made the referral in an order posted Thursday night. Advertisement Waymo has sued Uber, alleging that the ride-hailing company is using stolen Waymo technology to develop its own self-driving vehicles. Alsup is presiding over the lawsuit. ‘‘This case is referred to the United States attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC’s claims for trade secret misappropriation,’’ Alsup wrote in the order.

Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘The court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States attorney,’’ he wrote. The high-stakes corporate espionage case revolves around Waymo’s allegations that Uber’s work on self-driving cars has been riding on trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing details about a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what’s around them. Advertisement Waymo has alleged in its lawsuit that Levandowski and Uber conspired to create a sham self-driving truck startup called Otto as a prelude to a $680 million deal for Uber to buy Otto and get the desperately needed technology. After Uber bought Otto, Levandowski took over oversight of Uber’s self-driving car division. He stepped down from the role earlier this month until Waymo’s lawsuit is resolved. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo’s ideas, maintaining that its Lidar system is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to turn over his personal laptop or answer most other questions posed by Waymo’s lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

The company’s Nexus branded phones weren’t slouches, per se, but they could never truly compete with the cream of the crop like Samsung and Apple flagship phones. In 2016, however, that all changed. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL were true flagship phones inside and out, featuring a sleek aluminum design and top-of-the-line specs. We all expect Google to continue the trend in 2017 when it launches the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, and now we have our first real indication that will indeed be the case. Don't Miss: Google’s mysterious new Fuchsia mobile OS shown off on a smartphone for the first time We have known for some time now that Google’s next-generation Pixel 2 smartphone is codenamed “Taimen,” and now the device has been referenced online yet again. This time around, however, the source of the reference is Primate Labs. If you recognize the name, you know exactly where we’re heading with this: Geekbench 4 benchmark test results for the Pixel 2 have been spied on the Primate Labs website. As you can see above, the Pixel 2 prototype responsible for these test results was running Android O. The phone itself is powered by Qualcomm’s latest octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset, just like the US version of Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Also just like the S8 and S8+, the Pixel 2 appears to be a powerhouse. The phone’s single-core score of 1804 is well shy of the iPhone 7 Plus’ record, but it’s about inline with what we’ve seen from the Galaxy S8. The multi-core score is also nearly as impressive as Samsung’s Galaxy S8 scores, and we’ll remind you that the Galaxy S8 is the most powerful Android phone the world has ever seen. These benchmark scores were achieved by a Pixel 2 prototype, but it’s obviously quite likely that the phone’s performance will be roughly the same at launch. And now for the bad news: That launch isn’t expected until much later this year.

Ok, so it’s something you might not really have a use for as of now, but you can’t deny the fact that it’s actually nicely done. So if you have Google Allo on your phone, you can try this new feature out. Works like this, Google says: “Simply snap a selfie, and it’ll return an automatically generated illustrated version of you, on the fly, with customization options to help you personalize the stickers even further.” The simple explanation is that Google applies some algorithms to the selfie you took. It takes into consideration elements like lighting conditions, eye color, hairstyles, surrounding visual contexts to generate these stickers. Google applies neural networks to what the cameras see, and then matches them with a huge collection of artists’ works to give you your very individualized sticker collection. To get more info on this feature, you can click on the source link below. The feature is now rolling out to Allo for Android, and Google says Allo on iOS will be getting this feature soon enough.

That's bad for democracy and politics. How to break out of that bubble? Have a thriving public service media that serves up news people need to know. This is an edited excerpt of a speech by Professor Timothy Garton Ash, historian and author, at the St Gallen Symposium on May 5. Almost everywhere free speech is under attack. That attack is part of a global anti-liberal counter- revolution. It's a conscious reaction against the spread of liberty and liberalism over the last 40 years. The little magic box, the smartphone, which we all have in our pockets or bags means that we can communicate almost instantaneously with roughly half of humankind, three billion people and going up fast. What we have already is what I call a cosmopolis, a world which is becoming like a single great city. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Now, this is a fantastic chance for free speech. But it brings with it equally large risks. Through the smartphone, through the Internet, and in a world of mass migration, we see more and more examples of what I call the assassin's veto, people like those who murdered the journalists of Charlie Hebdo, saying if you say that or publish that, we will kill you, and the threat being sufficiently credible to have a deeply chilling effect on free speech. Professor Timothy Garton Ash says the "state should be going after dangerous speech but it's very, very, very dangerous territory, a slippery slope if you get into the territory where the state is deciding what is false and what is true". PHOTO: NYTIMES Through the Internet, (there is) harassment, cyber bullying, grooming for paedophile activities, surveillance and the erosion of privacy. A great expert on the Internet has said surveillance is the business model of the Internet. And it's true. How do Facebook and Google make their money? You don't pay but they sell you to advertisers. (In such a world) we need uncensored, diverse, trustworthy media to make well-informed decisions and participate fully in political life. In other words, we need free speech for democracy. For at least two centuries we have had a public good - news, the information we need for democracy - delivered by private means. That model worked because people would pay for a newspaper and advertising revenue. The Internet has just knocked away both these pillars. So the newspapers produce the information. Facebook and Google get the profit... Nobody has one single big answer but I think public service media is part of the answer - foundations funding serious news, investigative reporting and foreign news... (so) you don't have to go to the state for it. MARKET FAILURE IN THE MARKETPLACE OF IDEAS In ancient Athens, they talked about free speech in terms of two concepts - parrhesia and isegoria. Parrhesia was free speech but free speech with good intention for the public good. Not saying whatever came into your head but free speech for the public good. Isegoria was equal speech, that everyone had in principle an equal right to speak. They listened to all the arguments for one policy or another. They listened to all the evidence that was available. They were given all the facts. And then they came to a decision. They decided to fight the invading Persian armies at sea and not on land. And thus it was that they came to win the battle of Salamis. By free speech, by deliberative democracy, they saved the world's first democracy. So, that's why we have media. Our exchanges are mediated by the media. In all liberal democracies, the fourth estate, the media, is an essential part. In the United States, Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1787: "Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers, or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate for a moment. I'll take the newspapers." We have the concept from Oliver Wendell Holmes of the marketplace of ideas: The best ideas will win out, the best policies will win out on the basis of evidence-based, reality-based debate. Now, here's the problem: that as an unintended consequence of the Internet, of the digital revolution of the smartphone world we're in, we are beginning to lose the media we need for democracy. And it's the populists who are most effectively exploiting the possibilities given by the Internet to attack liberal pluralistic democracy. Since the Internet offers a near infinity of platform outlets for speech, the result has been a dramatic fragmentation of the media landscape. More and more people are listening in more and more disparate groups, and this has a very powerful echo-chamber effect. Increasingly, people are only hearing the news and the views of people who agree with them. Donald Trump's supporters hear only Fox News and Breitbart and talk radio's Rush Limbaugh and their friends on Facebook. And Hillary Clinton supporters, MSNBC or CNN and NPR and The New York Times, and their friends on Facebook. There's a lot of good evidence now that this is a really powerful echo-chamber effect which already begins to undermine the core idea of free speech for deliberative democracy - which is you hear all the arguments and all the evidence and all the points of view. These days, 30 to 40 per cent of the news that young Americans get is from Facebook. It's a question of absolute overwhelming public interest what the Facebook news feed algorithm is doing. The other thing you get on the Internet is a massive repetition. It's not just that people are told, for example, that Britain sends £350 million a week to the EU, to Brussels (simply untrue), or that Barack Obama was not born in the United States. You are told it a thousand times every day because of this constant repetition effect. And what makes lies effective in propaganda is sheer repetition. And misinformation, false news is as likely to go viral as reliable news. Then there is anonymity, which provides extraordinary possibilities for hostile powers, public or private, to disseminate and multiply misinformation by bots, by accounts which are actually automated but which look like a real person and a real user. Anonymity has a huge contribution to the level of hate speech and abuse and indeed death threats online. Very simply, the Internet is destroying the business model of newspapers. For at least two centuries, we have had a public good - news, the information we need for democracy - delivered by private means. A newspaper was a means of delivering the public good of news by private means. AJ Liebling, the great writer on journalism, said the role of a newspaper is to inform but its function is to make money. Our good fortune was that, for nearly two centuries, that model worked because people would pay for a newspaper and advertising revenue. The Internet has just knocked away both these pillars. So the newspapers produce the information. Facebook and Google get the profit. And this has a very negative effect on the newspapers on which we have relied for our news. First of all, what do you do if you're drowning? Well, you wave and you shout. So all our newspapers are becoming more sensational, more partisan, more celebrity; more sensationalist, more "if it bleeds it leads, if it roars, it scores". The desperate competition for the clickstream, clickbait. The amount of serious news, investigative journalism and foreign reporting is going down because that's expensive. This is a real problem for the journalism we need for democracy. What we have here is potentially a market failure in the marketplace of ideas. THE PROBLEM WITH POPULISM I now come to populism. The characteristic features of populism (include) the fact that it's always nationalist, that it seeks direct legitimation with the people, (but) that the people turn out in fact to be only part of the people. There are always the "other people" who don't belong to the fold, defined ethnoculturally - Mexicans, Muslims, Kurds, East Europeans - or sociopolitically - the elites, the experts, the mainstream media. The other thing that populism does is that it quite skilfully aggregates quite different social groups and social interests to create coalitions of the unwilling, everybody who is outside, who is left behind, who is disconnected, discontented for one reason or another. They found a great glue to hold those groups together. And that glue is a powerful, simplistic, emotionally appealing nationalist narrative. Make America great again. Take back control. On est chez nous (This is our home), as Le Front National chant at their rallies, or dobra zmiana, good change, in Poland. A strong, simplistic, emotionally appealing narrative and that glues them together. The problem is that all the characteristics which I've just described to you as the impact of the disruptive Internet on the media by and large enable and facilitate and even strengthen that kind of a rhetoric and the fake news and the alternative facts. The echo-chamber effect? Obviously. The tendency of commercial media to shout to be partisan, less and less of them to take a neutral middle ground where you hear all views together. The facility with which misinformation and disinformation can be spread. Anonymity and so on. All of that facilitates the work of the populist. Everybody now is talking about fake news. But I don't think fake news is the heart of the problem. The heart of the problem is this emotional, simplistic narrative. What Jacob Burckhardt, the great historian, called the terribles simplificateurs who are at work. The Sun newspaper during the Brexit campaign. Banner headline on the front page "Queen Backs Brexit". Totally untrue but very powerful. The Brexit story about the £350 million. Donald Trump said that Barack Obama was not born in the United States, whereupon Barack Obama published his birth certificate. What did Donald Trump say? He said: "Many people feel it wasn't a proper certificate." Just think about that for a moment. He didn't even say many people think. Many people feel. It's the emotion. And your feeling is stronger than the reason. So it's the enabling of these lie-based, fake news-based emotional narratives. So the divide is no longer right and left. It's between nationalist and internationalist, anti-European and pro-European, close and open and between emotion and reason. The basic epistemology of liberal democracy is under attack because back in ancient Athens there was also an epistemology of democracy, which said we basically agree what are facts, what is evidence, what is rational argument although we disagree about what's a right cause and that is being undermined. What do we do about this problem if I'm right? First of all, if you have public service media, good public service media, hang on to them for dear life because the mission of a BBC or an SRF, or whatever it may be, (is) a media where you hear all the alternative arguments and evidence in one place. Secondly, fact checking has very rapidly become a part of the ecosystem of American journalism and the Internet actually makes it easier to fact check (in real time). Education, we should already years ago have started doing mandatory classes in digital literacy, in media literacy in our schools and in our universities because you've got to equip citizens to understand what's going on. Then there is what I call the public responsibilities of the private superpowers (companies such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, Apple). I think the path down which Germany is going - which is trying to legislate responsibility on Google and Facebook and Twitter for fake news - is quite the wrong way to go. The state should be going after dangerous speech but it's very, very, very dangerous territory, a slippery slope if you get into the territory where the state is deciding what is false and what is true. That is really incompatible with the most basic philosophical arguments of free speech. Last but not least, this is a challenge for the craft of journalism because the question for quality journalism, leaving aside the business questions, is not so much how do you establish the facts because that's relatively easy. The challenge for journalism is to get those facts and that evidence into the echo chambers of the populace and to get them to readers and viewers who don't particularly even want to hear them because they'd much rather have the warming solidarity of simplistic indignation. I think we need almost a new George Orwell, a new Animal Farm to tell this story of what actually is, in powerful but simple and emotionally appealing terms, in language that reaches a wider audience. Everybody is looking for the new business model for journalism. At the moment in many countries, newspapers still set the news agenda and Britain is a prime example. It wasn't the Internet that helped decide the Brexit referendum, it was the news agenda set by a largely eurosceptic press. But in five, 10 years, the existing business model (will be) gone and what's going to come in its place? Nobody has one single big answer but I think public service media is part of the answer - foundations funding serious news, investigative reporting and foreign news is an important part of the answer because that means you don't have to go to the state for it. Entirely Internet, digital native news sites like BuzzFeed or Vice are actually doing much better than legacy media. They started with fairly sensational news; they're now doing really good- quality serious foreign and political reporting. The answer is probably going to come in some mix of these things.

Photo / Jasper Juinen The Black Diamond library sits at a slight forward slant on Copenhagen's riverfront, resembling a pair of Borg spaceships peering into the water. On the morning of a European Commission citizens' dialogue in early February, the building's coal-dark facades were slicked with rain and mist, but more than 100 people had trooped into its auditorium. The event was an episode in a travelling roadshow in which the 28 European Union commissioners -- one per member state, each with a portfolio such as trade or transport -- take turns fielding questions and explaining their policies. One of the two commissioners anchoring the dialogue was Margrethe Vestager, the Danish politician who has turned into a heated celebrity as head of the EU's directorate general for competition. Her job as chief sleuth requires her to protect the union's vision of a fair market, and she's set about it with gusto. Last August, Vestager announced that Ireland had granted Apple illegal tax benefits, and she directed the company to pay more than US$14 billion in back taxes and interest. It was a rare boulder slung at a Goliath, and it drew cheers in many quarters in the US and overseas. Vestager's entire tenure has been laced with an instinctive mistrust of big corporations. She's driven investigations of Amazon.com, Fiat, Gazprom, Google, McDonald's and Starbucks -- and she still has two and a half years remaining in her term. Rulings on McDonald's and Amazon, both under scrutiny for their tax deals with Luxembourg, are imminent. If Vestager levies a multibillion-dollar fine against Google -- a distinct possibility because the company is fighting three separate European antitrust cases -- she will truly set headlines aflame. As with Apple and Amazon, these cases were bequeathed to Vestager by her predecessor, but she's accelerated them to their finish lines.American furyLarge American multinationals aren't used to being stymied overseas, and Vestager's consistent readiness to face off against them has provoked a startled fury. Continued below. Related Content Fran O'Sullivan: Technology giants eat media's cash Mary Holm: Don't take a gamble on the forex trade Brian Gaynor: Cannabis stocks don't take long to get high American fury Tim Cook, Apple's chief executive officer, called the tax decision against his company "total political crap". And a group of 185 American CEOs appealed directly to European heads of government to reverse the ruling, describing it as "a grievous self-inflicted wound". Even the US government has felt the need to speak out. A white paper released by the Department of the Treasury last August criticised Vestager's office for acting like a "supranational tax authority" and setting "an undesirable precedent". In late March the office of the US Trade Representative reiterated its opinion, as part of a broader report, that Vestager is deviating too far from prior case law. One former Treasury official from the Obama Administration said Vestager's staff resembled "a bunch of plumbers doing electrical work". None of this has dissuaded Vestager, who continues to defend one of the EU's foundational philosophies -- that a well-policed economy yields the largest and most widespread benefits for society. At a moment when the EU is convulsing with fresh doubt -- impelled by Brexit, various species of populist nationalism, Greek frailty, Russian meddling, and a disenchantment with eurozone debt -- Vestager has become one of the most visible, vocal champions of the union. This year she made Time magazine's list of the world's 100 most influential people. "I think she's tough and serious," Anthony Gardner, the US ambassador to the EU from 2014 to 2017, says. "I would even call her a superstar." Picture of diligence A year shy of 50, Vestager radiates efficiency and self-control. She never slouches; her clothes appear polished but comfortable, picked out for long working hours; not one movement is superfluous. Even her hair has been cropped short for years, as if to give her one less thing to do every morning. During the Black Diamond event, she was the picture of diligence. When the panelists sat down, she uncapped water bottles for them; when the moderator conducted a set of quick audience polls, she took photos of upraised hands; when Financial Stability Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis talked about Europe's wind-power industry, she twisted in her chair to listen to every word, not looking away from him once. In speaking about her work, Vestager is always fluently, adhesively on message. Even cursory attendance at her speeches and press events is enough to become familiar with her talking points. She frequently invokes the Treaty of Rome, which founded the European Economic Community 60 years ago, as a way of situating her office and its mission in the very headwaters of the EU. She likes to say Europe welcomes business of all kinds. "If you win on the market, that's fair -- we'll congratulate you," she said at the library. "But if you cheat on the way up, then that's for us to look at." Trump and protectionism Someone asked her if she'll be warier of acting against American companies now that Donald Trump is President. The audience tittered uneasily. Nothing would change, she replied. "We're not going hard at US companies specifically. It's not your flag that matters to us. What really matters is: If you want to do business in Europe, you play by the European rule book." This was another of her well-worn aphorisms, but it masked the latest international wrinkles. Trump has already shown himself to be volatile on trade policy, reflexively defensive of US interests, and an intermittent advocate of the collapse of the EU. His protectionist swagger has rattled Brussels; in March, Jean-Claude Juncker, the chief of the European Commission, warned that relations with Washington "have entered into a sort of estrangement", and that any American tariffs on European products will trigger swift reciprocal action. If this happens, Vestager's office will become even more politically charged, liable to be deployed in retaliation and to attract even more American anger. Ice queen Vestager began her political career in 1988, at 20, working for Denmark's Radikale Venstre -- in direct translation, the "Radical Left", though the party is habitually cast as the Social Liberals. Its principles are centrist, leaning toward economic conservatism. Vestager's maternal great-grandfather helped found the party, and her parents were members. Lutheran pastors both, the doors of their house were open to anyone who wanted to drop by for advice or spiritual succour. Vestager rapidly shinned up the party's ranks. When she was 29, she was put in charge of two ministries, education and ecclesiastical affairs, and served on several government committees. Her reputation as a thorough but prickly -- even callous -- politician grew. Almost inevitably, she acquired the label "ice queen". In the fall of 2011, Vestager's career reached a fulcrum. A conservative government, convinced it made fiscal sense to cut unemployment and early retirement benefits, staked its survival on the issues by calling fresh elections. Vestager supported the reforms, but she befuddled everyone by declaring her allegiance to an electoral alliance of left-leaning parties that were promising to roll back the austerity measures. When the coalition won, Vestager and the leaders of her allied parties hunkered down in a hotel on the outskirts of Copenhagen to wrangle over policy details and cabinet positions. On the question of cutting welfare, she refused to back down -- part of the reason the negotiations lasted three weeks. At one point during those weeks in the hotel, Vestager realised she was in control of the parleys, and she made an audacious demand: the finance ministry for herself. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks as he attends the Economic Summit. Photo / AP As she expected, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the prime minister-elect, declined. Vestager called the marriage off. After a day, Henrik Kjerrumgaard, her communications adviser at the time, recalls, Vestager invited Thorning-Schmidt to her house. Thorning-Schmidt offered Vestager a troika of titles -- deputy prime minister, minister of the economy, minister of the interior -- amalgamated into a single job just for her. The austerity measures remained in place. Four years after taking over a small, flailing party, the minister's daughter had become the second-most powerful person in Denmark. Through the thick of the recession, Vestager struggled to revive Denmark's economy. In 2012, trying to explain the inevitability of austerity, she let slip a stray remark -- "That's how it is" -- that went viral; she was eviscerated for being uncaring and out of touch. That same year she chaired meetings of Europe's economic and finance ministers. Relying in part on that experience, Thorning-Schmidt named Vestager to the European Commission in 2014, where Juncker put her in charge of competition. Within the EU, the DG Comp -- the directorate general for competition -- considers itself an enforcement agency, wedded only to the rule of law and above the politicking that riddles the bureaucracy elsewhere. With the research capacities of a 900-strong staff, Vestager makes decisions related to cartels and antitrust, approves or rejects mergers, and investigates state aid cases, in which member countries single out companies for unfair advantages such as tax breaks. In the US, state aid by way of targeted tax incentives is a legitimate strategy to lure investment; in Europe, it's a forbidden tactic. Biblical patriarch Commissioners come into their offices with varying objectives. "Vestager has made the tax investigations a very big priority indeed," says Gert-Jan Koopman, a deputy director general in DG Comp. He disagrees with the perception that Vestager nurses a vendetta against American companies. The splashiest cases of her tenure -- Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks -- were all opened by Joaqun Almunia of Spain. "It's very unreasonable to claim that she proactively decided to go after these companies," Koopman says. The numbers bear this out. Of the 276 companies involved in antitrust cases opened by Almunia, 39 were American; in Vestager's term, the breakdown is 11 of 81. The friction between corporate America and DG Comp is in some manner cultural. American executives are often flummoxed when Vestager discusses competition law in the severe moral terms of a Biblical patriarch. "When we have a case and you take away the specifics and the technicalities of the law, what you find is basically the same as Adam and Eve," she says. "It's about greed -- wanting to have something and taking a shortcut to get it. Or sometimes fear -- fear of being driven out of the market if your competitors are growing into a strong position." Meetings between American CEOs and competition commissioners can go badly. As ambassador to the EU, Anthony Gardner, met often with visiting CEOs on their way to meet Vestager and gave them an informal lay of the land. "I was very clear with them. Don't go in and lecture. It won't work with her," he says. "And what they should not do is engage in a public-relations campaign of slamming the commission, which has unfortunately happened in a few cases." When Apple's Cook visited Vestager in her office in January 2016, she was at her steely best, one witness to the meeting says. "I think Mr Cook was more in a lecturing mode, and somehow they didn't really connect terribly well." Apple declined to comment for this story. Vestager says the Apple case is, in its principles, no different from any other state aid investigation. Her declaration of Apple's US$14b-plus-interest tax bill flared brightly, she says, "because it's a big number, and because it's a company that everyone knows". No state aid ruling has ever resulted in a recovery so enormous. In a March 2016 letter to Vestager, Cook wrote that he was concerned "about the fairness of these proceedings"; when the decision was announced, Apple and Ireland promptly appealed it. The money will be placed in escrow until European courts deliver a final decision, a process that's likely to take years. In the meantime, there will be other cases, other rulings. DG Comp is determining if Bayer AG's US$66b purchase of Monsanto will make the EU's agrochemical market anticompetitive. Vestager is also readying her decision on Luxembourg's tax relationship with McDonald's, which could be ready before the European Commission breaks for the summer in August. Her investigation may already have forced McDonald's to react; in December, the company announced it will shift its tax base to the UK. Obligation to be an optimistHowever insistent Vestager might be that her job involves a pure application of the law, it's also inarguably informed by politics. It is, for example, a political virtue to demonstrate to eurosceptics -- as she does -- Brussels's supervision of its member states and its resolve to protect the welfare of Europe's citizens. "In general, there is a different sort of awareness and a legislative momentum on tax cases," she says, attributing this attentiveness to the financial crisis and the tax revelations contained in the Luxembourg Leaks and Panama Papers episodes. "People have felt that benefits were cut in some member states, public salaries were cut maybe 10 to 15 per cent -- very hard-core decisions to get in control of your spending. And then, when people see that not all businesses contribute, I think the frustration and the anger about this have been largely underestimated." In the choppy new world order, if the US abandons its post at the tiller and retreats into itself, Vestager says, "Europe can step forward to fill whatever vacuum might appear." There is no room for worry, no time to fret. "I think it's more an obligation to be an optimist. Pessimism will never get anything done."

The changes mean Google is altering its app publishing process, how it assesses risk, and the look of its user-facing consent page. Users really won’t be affected, at least as far as how they use the email service and apps, but developers might face delays in publishing their web app. For instance, Google is going to be more intense about its risk assessment, which means some web apps might require a manual review. That app won’t be able to receive user data permissions until the review is complete, which could take up to a week. The company is also making sure developers don’t register an application or modify an existing one to mislead users. Last week’s phishing attack was so successful because the attacker named his web app “Google Docs” and recreated the legitimate company’s UI. These developer-focused changes follow Google’s immediate actions taken after the phishing attack. That same day, it removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and put its abuse team on the case. As Russell Brandom wrote for The Verge last week, Google’s renewed security focus might help prevent future attacks, but going forward, all companies are going to have to rethink how they work with developers to make apps while also keeping users safe.

Puskar, File AP Photo Business May 12, 2017 2:14 PM Criminal allegations, legal and image woes mount for Uber By TOM KRISHER and MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writers LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story SAN FRANCISCO A rare order from a federal judge alerting prosecutors to possible criminal misconduct by Uber or a key executive deepens the turmoil swirling around the ride-hailing company at a time when it's grappling with other legal and image problems. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco referred a civil case filed against Uber by Waymo to the U.S. Attorney's Office "for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets." It threatens to trigger a second U.S. government investigation of a company that has pushed the legal boundaries through most of its eight-year history. At stake is Uber's estimated $68 billion valuation, a possible public stock offering and the future of its self-driving car program, which its CEO has said is the key to the company's future. Waymo, a self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., sued Uber in February alleging that Uber is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own fleet of autonomous cars. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco didn't respond to requests for comment. Experts say prosecutors are likely to follow up on Alsup's order and launch an investigation. The probe, combined with other legal and image woes, will reduce Uber's value and in the worst case could threaten the San Francisco company's existence if investors leave, criminal charges bring huge fines and legal action stalls autonomous car research, the experts say. Uber wouldn't comment Friday on a possible criminal probe. Federal prosecutors already have requested information from at least two cities about use of phony software to thwart city officials looking at whether Uber was following local regulations. Alsup wrote in his order that he wasn't taking a position on whether prosecution was warranted. Alsup, 71, has gained a reputation as a no-nonsense judge since he was appointed to the bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton. The Harvard Law graduate has experience in trials involving high-profile technology companies, including a 2012 patent and copyright infringement case pitting Oracle against Google. For a judge to take such a public step, he must have more than just a whiff of criminal activity, legal experts say. Prosecutors get many tips, but rarely do they come from a judge who is familiar with evidence and the legal elements of what is a crime. "This is not some private informant that slipped an envelope under the door at midnight. This is public and it's a judge," said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. An investigation would siphon executive resources at Uber just as CEO Travis Kalanick faces many other challenges, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in white-collar crime and corporate governance. "The possibility that you could get criminally indicted would be exactly the wrong thing for Uber," Coffee said. In addition to the apparent inquiry into the software called "Greyball" to impede city inspectors, Uber still has to deal with Waymo's high-stakes espionage lawsuit. It alleges that Uber is using trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who formed his own company which was bought by Uber $680 million. After that deal, Levandowski began to oversee Uber's self-driving car division. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents with details of a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to answer most questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He recently agreed to step down as Uber's top self-driving car executive, though he still works at the company. Beyond the possible criminal cases, Kalanick in February was forced to quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders after Uber was boycotted by some customers. A female former engineer made a series of sexual harassment allegations about her boss, and a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver went viral, forcing him to concede he needs leadership help. Earlier this week, Uber suffered a huge legal setback when a European Union judge ruled that it was a transport company and could be required to get licenses and permits in the 28 EU nations. Uber had sought to persuade Alsup to send the dispute between Waymo and Levandowski to private arbitration hearings. But the judge rejected that request, meaning the case will play out in a public court, risking further image damage for Uber. Just months ago Uber was discussing what could have been the largest public stock offering in history, but its troubles now make that all but impossible, Gordon said. Uber can survive the troubles, but it has an uphill fight, said Gordon. If the court finds that Uber used Google's Lidar technology, that will slow Uber's autonomous car research, leaving it behind competitors. The company would either have to pay Alphabet to use it or buy it from a supplier, both expensive options, Gordon said. The company's strategy of fostering rapid growth by flouting laws may wind up being its undoing, Gordon said. "The empire is striking back."

May 12, 2017 - Written By Justin Diaz Google I/O 2017 is literally just around the corner as it starts next week from May 17th through the 19th, and while it’s impossible to know for sure what Google has planned for the Keynote speech, it is possible to speculate on what they might have to show off or announce during the hour and half long portion of the event that kicks off the whole conference. Naturally, the biggest thing that Google may have to show off at the event is Android O-related, and the speculation is that they’ll be announcing the second developer preview of Android O during the keynote, and then making it available for download that same day so developers as well as interested consumers will be able to load it up on their compatible devices. Another possibility for what Google may have to show off is Fuchsia. While Google hasn’t officially announced anything with Fuchsia yet there have been some rumblings about it since last year and just recently some screenshots were leaked of what the Fuchsia UI design seems to look like. This suggests that they may be close to showing a working prototype of the operating system fairly soon, and with Google I/O coming up next week, there really couldn’t be a better time since this would be software-related and Google I/O is mostly for developers. That being said, there is a good chance they may not show it off or even talk about it either, as they were suspected to maybe do something with it last year and it was nowhere to be found. While not necessarily the most likely, it’s possible that Google could have some stuff to announce that revolves around virtual reality and augmented reality, which would mean it would be revolving around the Daydream and Tango platforms. This could be anything from new hardware to just new software, or further advancement of the platforms themselves. When it comes down to it, there are tons of possibilities for what Google could announce at I/O next week from Chrome to Android TV to more Google Assistant-related stuff. Everything is technically up in the air at the moment but it won’t be long before all of this public knowledge, seeing as how the Keynote will happen next Wednesday morning at 10 am.

Unfortunately, most of the information out there is misleading and/or wrong and has been from the beginning. Furthermore, not only does this misinformation not help, but it’s clouding the serious, legitimate problem. It’s not GPS nor only about Apple Let’s get two things out of the way first: the data in question is not GPS and Apple isn’t the only party collecting this data. The data consists of cell tower and Wi-Fi hotspot locations, not GPS coordinates. Second, it’s been shown that Google collects this data from Android devices, and anyone else in both the mapping and smartphone businesses should be doing the same. If they aren’t, they’ll be out of one of those businesses soon. Remember these points for later. Taking it from the top… The firestorm ignited when Pete Warden and Alasdair Allan announced their discovery of a file called “consolidated.db” that contains a list of locations and time stamps. This file is located on iOS devices and their backup files located on users’ computers. They further demonstrated how the data can be used to generate a map of these locations. By itself, that would have been a fine piece of work. However, Allan and Warden peppered their report with insinuation and omissions that led others to draw their own conclusions as to the purpose of this data, which led to the current atmosphere of controversy and misinformation. Perhaps worst of all, they failed to give credit where it’s due. Taking it from the REAL top… Turns out the existence of the consolidated.db file was published in a book called “iOS Forensic Analysis for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch” in December 2010. This revelation comes from Alex Levinson, a contributor to that book, who posted this photo of page 335 for proof. Levinson further points out that he and Sean Morrissey, the book’s primary author, demonstrated their own utility similar (and superior) to Warden and Allan’s mapping application in February 2011 at the DoD Cyber Crimes Conference in Washington, DC. Levinson explains that while the consolidated.db file is new in iOS 4, the data is not. It previously existed in a file called “h-cells.plist”. Levinson also shares his thoughts on how the data is used in both that post and a new one. However, to really understand its purpose, I think we need to go back even further. They’re not spying; you are. While it’s been claimed that we don’t know how Apple will use this location data, we actually do. In a letter to Congress in June of last year addressing a change in their privacy policy, Apple explained that they are building and using their own location database, in addition to and instead of Google and Skyhook Wireless databases. What exactly is in this database? Cell tower and Wi-Fi hotspot locations, same as in the consolidated.db file. See, technically, what’s in that consolidated.db isn’t a list of places your iPhone has been. It’s actually a list of cell tower and Wi-Fi hotspots your iPhone has detected. Your iPhone’s location can be inferred from that list (with varying degrees of accuracy), but that’s not its purpose. Think of a spy tracking a terrorist cell. As the cell moves, the spy reports back to his or her agency with their locations. The spy does not report his or her own location, but since he or she is maintaining proximity to the terrorists, a rough estimate can be inferred from the data. That’s what’s happening with the location data in consolidated.db. Apple isn’t spying on you; you’re spying for Apple. I didn’t sign up to be a spy Well, you might have. When you set up your iOS device, Apple asks if you want to help improve its products by sending anonymous diagnostic and usage information. As indicated earlier in Apple’s letter to Congress about the change in the privacy policy, this includes location-based data. It’s important to note this agreement is separate from any agreement to use location-based services. LBS is about using your location, while the relevant part of this agreement is about acquiring the location of cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots. Your location can be inferred from the data if and only if someone knows it’s from your device. Collected anonymously, it’s a map of tower and hotspot locations. Aggregated with data from other users, it loses relevance to any one user. The data collection really has nothing to do with tracking users. So what’s the point? The reason Apple is collecting this data is to build and maintain their own assisted GPS database. Using the known locations of cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, assisted GPS estimates your location without a GPS lock and cuts the time required to get a lock. When Apple launched the iPhone, they signed a deal with Skyhook Wireless to provide this service. But in April 2010 with iOS 3.2, Apple started using their own database, and they’re not alone. Location-based services are building to be big business with a big pot of money attached to it. Research by Microsoft indicates the LBS market is growing rapidly. Skyhook Wireless went after Google for millions in a lawsuit in which they claim Google pressured Motorola into breaking their contract for LBS with Skyhook. Any company that offers location-based services needs a dynamic database of waypoints, such as cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots, in order to accurately tell mobile users where they are, particularly in urban environments where GPS is restricted. One option is to license that database from Skyhook Wireless. Another is to build your own, such as Apple and Google are known to be doing. I guarantee Microsoft, RIM and others who offer mobile location-based services are either already following Apple’s and Google’s lead or figuring their own method of leveraging their user base to do so. If they’re not, they’re watching someone else eat their piece of the LBS pie. So if everyone does it, what’s the problem? While folks wrestle with an imaginary privacy scare grown through misinformation, there remains a legitimate privacy concern that is going mostly unnoticed. It concerns the lack of clear disclosure that this data was being collected and the risks involved in collecting it. Apple asks for diagnostic and usage information about your iPhone, which is fair enough to do. However, I don’t believe tracking tower and hotspot locations counts. That information is external to the device, not part of it. If Apple wanted to collect data on my iPhone’s location, I would consider that a fair part of that agreement. But instead they’re using my iPhone to collect tower and hotspot locations, and that’s not right. I only signed up to give info about my device, not those belonging to other people. The lack of transparency on that point is a serious problem, far more legitimate than the paranoia circulating. To be clear, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with reporting tower and hotspot locations back to Apple. I just think this falls outside the range of “diagnostic and usage information about your iPhone”. It’s about property that belongs to others. Therefore, it requires separate, specific permission, as well as a detailed explanation of the risk involved. By retrieving the data anonymously, Apple protects your privacy from Apple. What they don’t do is protect your privacy from anyone else. If someone else extracts this data from your iDevice or the backup file on your computer, that person is the one violating your privacy, beginning the moment they access your device without consent. True, it’s not Apple’s fault someone else accessed your data, but they should have told users this data was there to be taken. As far as privacy invasion goes, this data is trivial compared to the call and message history, contacts, and appointments on most people’s phones. The difference is users know that data is there and can erase it. Can’t do that with a file you don’t know about. The bottom line is, there is a problem, a serious one, but it’s not the one most people think. Apple is not spying on you; you’re spying for Apple. Same goes for Google and Android users. And if you think Microsoft, RIM, Nokia, and the wireless carriers are not or will not be deploying their own spies, well, you must not think very highly of their ability to compete. It’s not about who’s doing it, but how, and Apple isn’t doing it the way they should. Congress dropped the ball when the issue was raised last year (probably because they didn’t understand the problem), and all the fearmongering and misinformation this time only obscures the real problem. Update 4/27/11: Nailed it. 10 Responses 04/27/2011 Quentin Dewolf Reply the interesting part is that the cell phone companies have a very well known log of all phone calls and what towers they used and even how strong the connection was. Both for coverage review and for billing. If you are so worried about being tracked then you must not use a phone, credit card, or computer as all of these are tracked in logs and always have been. 04/28/2011 iPhone Spy Reply i was recently looking through the history on my computer, when i closed the window, went back in and the history was suddenly GONE. It was not after midnight at the usual automatic history erase time. My question.. My bf has an iphone. Is it possible he is controlling and spying on the computer with the VNSea App???? 04/29/2011 Web Hosting Reviews Reply Excellent statement!!.. 04/29/2011 gEEk Reply What if you looked at it not as reporting about other people’s devices but on the environment your iPhone is in? Would you see it breaking the terms of “diagnostic and usage information” if the iPhone collected and reported the temperature of the environment it was used in? How is that different from collecting and reporting transmitters in the iPhones environment? 04/29/2011 Sumocat Reply That would be fine if that was how it worked, but it’s not. The system reports on the locations of hotspots and towers, which are private property, not by the wireless signals, which is publicly broadcast. Using the temperature analogy, it’s like collecting the temps of nearby buildings instead of the temp of the ambient air. That said, the idea of environment reporting is valid. Skyhook Wireless does recognize location by wireless signal environment. Their wardriving system for hotspot recognition captures location data by identifying wireless signal patterns, not by locating hotspots. (This is enhanced by voluntary registration of Wi-Fi hotspots, which does capture locations, but again, that’s voluntary.) Possibly hotspot locations could be inferred from that data, just as devices use it to infer their own locations, but it’s not captured directly. I do not know if the data capture system they employ through mobile devices works the same way. 04/30/2011 gEEk Reply Aren’t they specifically reporting the location of the phone when it detects a wireless signal, not the location of the transmitter itself (which I don’t think the phone has any way of knowing for a non-voluntarily registered hotspot). The wireless routers are private property. The radio signals they broadcast are not private property. As long as the phone doesn’t connect to the network (other than reading the SSID) I don’t see how private property has been violated. I think a more appropriate temperature-based analogy would be building a database of indoor locations and outdoor locations based on the ambient temperature of the air at the phone. This only involves the phone observing its immediate environment, which is where the radio signal is located. Another useful analog is Google Maps StreetView. Although not crowdsourced (making it more similar to Skyhook) it is a database resulting from recording of electromagnetic waves in a public environment that have reflected or been transmitted from private property correlated to locations. Moreover the images have plenty of identifying marks visible on this private property including address placards and business signs. 04/30/2011 Sumocat Reply “Aren’t they specifically reporting the location of the phone when it detects a wireless signal…” — That is also happening but the database in question is of hotspot and tower locations. That data is being generated somehow. They could be using the phone locations to reverse triangulate the hotspot and tower locations. Using the spy analogy, that would be akin to reporting on one’s own coordinates and proximity to the terrorists. Less precise but still spying. 09/07/2011 abir ahmed Reply I do not understand why Apple should do this tracking business?! It will draw a bad impact on the market. tommy@ Restaurants around me 06/20/2012 myspy-online Reply Hi, there is a program up to a meter indicating the location of the smartphone and there is an opportunity to see the sms, mms, picture, email and more… 05/12/2017 joan Reply i hire a hacker once on http://underworlddwellers.esy.es to help me spy on my husbands iphone so i could monitor his whatsapp activities and it worked perfectly i still have the spyware server i dont know how he did it Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Michael Archambault is the Software Development Manager for Accusoft. Despite technology milestones in recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) can still suffer from unintended consequences. In 2016, Microsoft’s Twitter bot, Tay, tweeted racist and highly inappropriate statements after learning from her peers on the platform. Unable to overwrite the malicious information from social learning, Tay’s account was shut down and still remains private. Other incidents like Tay have also surfaced. One of the most notable was with Google’s image recognition software. Google Photos was accused of discrimination after labeling some non-white users as “gorillas.” Google claims the incident was unintentional, yet it remains an issue of concern that turned an overlooked piece of code into an issue of race. Unfortunately, algorithms like Microsoft’s and Google’s are still dependent on human input and their context is limited by the algorithm’s parameters. This is how Tay is unable to determine truth from internet trolling, and why Google Photos doesn’t have the ability to differentiate some non-white users from gorillas. However, this issue exists in more algorithms than we are aware of. This machine-based bias stems from the point when humans program artificial intelligence to automate machine learning. Because humans build the datasets used to train artificial intelligence biases, limitations and human error can affect the output, so the fault lies in how humans are training these machines from the beginning. Machines Are the Products of Human Interaction With AI, humans are the puppet masters. It is the human input that guides machines when they process the information used to classify datasets. In its simplest form, AI analyzes unfamiliar inputs within a database of known values to arrive at the correct output. Just like in human learning, the more algorithms are fed indexed images, the more accurate the software processing becomes. If you train an algorithm with hundreds of cat photos, it will be able to classify a photo of a Siamese that it’s never seen before as “cat.” However, issues can form when algorithms are trained with typical or perfect images in a controlled environment. If developers do not train these machines with data that represents diverse conditions, complications can arise. These issues can even affect unexpected applications of image processing software, like barcode recognition. Standard 1D barcodes consist of alternating black and white bars of various widths that contain encoded value. The scanners process the width by analyzing the width between the bars and matching it to a preselected set of parameters. If the bar is ambiguous due to poor lighting or print quality, the computer is unable to decipher the encoded data. In these cases, a computer is capable of detecting a variety of potential matches, but would need additional information to identify the correct value. A misread barcode can go beyond someone receiving an incorrect product from an online order. In hospitals, barcodes identify patients’ critical health information, like medication-specific allergies; an incorrect or partial scan could lead to serious consequences like anaphylactic shock or even death. Constantly having to correct machine mistakes leaves users vulnerable to these errors. Accuracy Requires Holistic Inputs Scanners are trained to recognize images using perfect examples, like a well-lit, clear photo. In reality, barcodes are often imperfect. Barcodes found on shipping labels can easily become distorted in transport, leading to errors when processing. In order to preempt this, developers need to use a variety of conditions and expand the range of inputs when building algorithms. In the case of barcode scanners, algorithms need to be trained using codes in an imperfect condition. For applications like Google’s Photo assistant, exposing the software to a diverse range of subjects can allow it to correctly identify and achieve the intended results. Like any good teacher, developers must create a realistic environment that the computer can use to process and compare features. For example, a person may see both a tiger and zebra and be able to differentiate the two based on the knowledge that they are different species. However, a computer, if not properly trained, will see the stripes and assume they are a similar classification. Humans know that it is illogical that a zebra and a tiger would be classified the same, but a computer needs to feed holistic inputs in order the clearly decipher the differences. While it seems logical to create a comprehensive database with clear datasets, in reality, most situations have some ambiguity. AI-powered machines have the capability for accuracy when algorithms encompass as many inputs as possible, but this is not a fix-all solution. More input will also expose the same bias present in humans, so how the machines decipher the input and features is an essential factor. As image recognition technology continues to be refined, developers need to be conscious of the images they use in their solutions and the implications it will have on their technology, and in the case of Google, society.

Brady Dale for Observer Snapchat’s parent company Snap, Inc really tanked this week. Who would have thought that a weird little messaging app with silly face filters might have possibly been overvalued? That abrupt drop represents the company’s first quarterly earnings report. Screenshot That said, Snap is larger than just Snapchat. In March 2016, it acquired Bitstrips, the owner of the Bitmoji app, for an estimated $100 million, as Fortune reported. Between Bitmoji and Snap, the company held the dominant spot in five different app markets last month, according to Recode. In fact, in France, Bitmoji was number one and Snapchat was number two. For the uninitiated, Bitmoji lets users choose from a variety of headshapes, skintones, mouths, eyes and outfit choices in order to make a cartoon that looks reasonably like the user. Friends and family will fill in the gaps with their imaginations. It’s not perfect, but it gets close. My co-worker is making one right now, and she doesn’t like her nose choices. It’s like: This reporter in Bitmoji. Snap, Inc. Once a user has made an avatar, Bitmoji has hundreds of scenes it can fit your Bitmoji into. Scenes that express all kinds of moods, sentiments and activities. Especially: “Let’s go drinking!” It’s one of those apps that a person finds easy to resist for a long time, but then get sort of obsessed with once he or she gives in. Right now, all the Bitmoji options are solo, though. I can send a message that says, “Let’s get donuts!” accompanied by this: Seriously though, let’s all go get donuts. Snap, Inc. But how great would it be if I could send that message with my Bitmoji and my recipient’s both springing out from the same giant donut? Snap’s leaving money on the table by not making the Bitmoji app social. It would be a fairly simple matter for Bitmoji to let users friend each other, giving each access to their contacts’ latest Bitmoji design. Rather than a billion more situational versions or more sponsored content, the app could level up by letting Bitmoji hang out together. As Mashable argued, Snapchat has done as well as it has so far by innovating (or acquiring innovative companies, anyway). Of late, Bitmoji has just been doing more of the same. Meanwhile, Google got a lot of attention this week for its Allo messaging app by baking in a giant Bitmoji ripoff. Where my colleague struggled to choose her nose during the Bitmoji onboarding, Allo just chose a nose for her after she took a selfie. This reporter. Google Allo My colleague. Google Allo Allo announced the new feature with a blog post this week. It doesn’t actually make a cartoon of you from scratch, as it might seem. Instead, it just chooses from a bunch of hairstyles, skintones and head shapes (which is what users do manually in Bitmoji). Adding that tiny layer of artificial intelligence is all that Google has added to a familiar process. If you want to try making your Allo cartoon, we’re here to help. It’s next to impossible to figure out how to do it on your own. We even asked Allo’s vaunted artificial intelligence how to make one, but it wasn’t much help: Google might want to let Allo know about the app’s most recent update. Screenshot Here’s how to do it: Buy an Android phone, because this feature hasn’t rolled out on iOS yet. Open up a chat with someone. This could be the hardest part since no one uses Allo. In the box at the bottom of the screen where you type a message, there is a plus sign over to the lower left. This opens the stickers. Tap it. This is the most confusing part to describe. There will be a bar at the top of the stickers. One of the options in the bar will look like a sloth, probably. All the way to right, there’s a post-it icon with a grin and a little plus symbol on it. This is for downloading new packs of stickers. Touch that. If your Allo app is up to date, the very first option should say something like: “Create your emoji selfie.” That’s what you need to do. It will open up the camera on selfie mode. Line up the glasses with your eyes and snap the shot. Now, you have a new pack of stickers that look like you. Don’t bother trying to redo it. When we did, nothing changed. That’s it. Feel free to delete Allo now. This app is way too creepy. Whether its impressiveness has been overblown or not, Allo’s latest trick shows that Facebook is not the only company looking to claim whatever new digital markets Snapchat has created. Who knows if making Bitmoji social could be enough to turn Snap’s fortunes around? It probably wouldn’t be, but it would at least add a fresh new layer on a strong but stagnating application. If it doesn’t work out for Snap, Inc in the long run, though, at least my co-worker managed to find a nose she was okay with before I finished writing this story: Coworker, as filtered by sponsored content.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Google Allo's Selfie Stickers Are Cool, But Don't Get Too Excited Susmita BaralYesterday 5:00pm Filed to: Google Apps Emoji 2 2 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image from Google Fans of Bitmoji: there’s a new caricature app that you’ll want to see. It’s more aesthetically pleasing and a breeze to use, but not so simple to share. Advertisement Google has a new feature in its latest update for Google Allo, an instant messaging mobile app released last September for Android and iOS users: selfie stickers—a custom caricature created by using a photo of any given user. The technology behind this feature (currently only available for Android users) makes for a unique experience. Google is utilizing machine learning and neural networks “to analyze the pixels of an image and algorithmically determine attribute values by looking at pixel values to measure color, shape, or texture.” Essentially, the app creates a cartoon sticker, illustrated by storyboard artist Lamar Abrams, that actually resembles what you look like. Something similar already exists The general concept is an awful lot like Bitmoji—a personal emoji spin-off app created by Bitstrips in 2014. But Google’s selfie sticker has a leg up on Bitmoji when it comes to being user-friendly and streamlining the emoji creation process. Advertisement Bitmoji’s cartoon avatars rely on users selecting features for themselves. This is great for personalization, as everything from wardrobe and body type to eyebrows and headgear can be customized. But it also leaves it to the user to hand-pick what they think they look like. And let’s face it—we’re often not the best judges of our own appearance. If you’re going for accuracy, Bitmojis leave a lot to be desired. With Google’s selfie sticker, the app does all the legwork behind emoji creation for you. So if you’re distraught over which pair of eyes best represents your own, worry no more—Allo is here to capture your true self. Google Opens Up Keep to G Suite Users and Adds Docs Integration Today, Google is officially adding its note taking tool, Keep, to its core G Suite service…Read more How Allo’s selfie sticker works Within the Allo app, you take a selfie and receive a cartoon within seconds. Then you can customize your face to make minor changes where the neural network may have slipped up. When all is said and done, you have 22 custom selfie stickers — and they look really good. Advertisement Sponsored That’s a stark difference from the process of creating a Bitmoji, where you have to handpick every aspect of your appearance. Regardless of whether you opt for Bitmoji or Bistrips style, the final result is significantly less aesthetically pleasing than Allo’s sticker. Here’s the issue When you look at the quality of the personalized emoji and the process to create it, Allo is the clear winner for the consumer. But there’s one major limitation with Allo’s selfie sticker: it only works within the Allo messaging app. Bitmoji, on the other hand, can be shared through SMS text message, iMessage, Facebook-owned WhatsApp, Gmail, Messenger, Slack and other messaging platforms by installing it into your keyboard. Users can also link Bitmoji with their Snapchat account — the app boasts 166 million daily active users and is a favorite among millennials. Allo hasn’t really taken off: it secured 10 million downloads at the end of last year, which pales in comparison to WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger’s 1.2 billion monthly active users. By limiting the selfie sticker to Allo, Google is restricting its potential to the pool of users that actually use the messaging app on a regular basis. For the user, this means you can’t really show off your cool new selfie sticker with anyone but fellow Allo users unless you screenshot, crop and send the sticker as a picture. Chances are, Google is hoping to boost Allo’s active users by offering selfie stickers but the company may be doing the feature (and the technology supporting it) an injustice by not creating a standalone app for it. Or, at the very least, it should do its users a solid and let them share the selfie stickers across various different platforms seamlessly through a keyboard app. For the user, as it stands currently, Allo’s personal emoji is easier to make and delivers a better product, but it falls short in its shareability.

By Natalie Gagliordi for Between the Lines | May 12, 2017 -- 20:39 GMT (13:39 PDT) | Topic: Developer The life of an Android release, before Project Treble. Via Google. Google has unveiled a new system that aims to streamline vendor Android updates. It's called Project Treble, and Google says it's the "biggest change yet to low-level system architecture." cloud tv Cloud migration: Dipping in a toe before diving all in The Colorado Center for Personalized Medicine rebuilt its data warehouse on the Google Cloud Platform, taking advantage of pay-as-you-go pricing to make sure it was the right move. Read More Treble is technically a vendor interface that sits between the Android OS framework and the device-specific, lower-level software written by chipmakers. It's powered by the new Vendor Test Suite (VTS) and is conceptually similar to the Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), which lets developers write apps that work across devices running on different hardware from different manufacturers. But instead of apps, Treble will work to ensure that all the chips inside of phones function properly when Google releases the latest version of Android. "Today, with no formal vendor interface, a lot of code across Android needs to be updated when a device moves to a newer version of Android," Google wrote in the Android developers blog. "With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers." The catch is that Project Treble's updates will not apply to older devices, only new devices released with Android O and beyond. However, the Project Treble architecture is currently running on Pixel phones using the O Developer Preview. Google says it plans to publish full Project Treble documentation with the launch of O later this summer.

Ron Amadeo - May 12, 2017 8:43 pm UTC reader comments 72 Share this story Google's description of the Android update process. This lines up perfectly with what HTC has told us before. The new "Vendor Interface" separates the Android framework from the hardware. Before Treble, every new Android update would require a rework of the silicon vendor's low-level software. With Project Treble, the new Android update can (supposedly) be dropped right on top of the existing vendor implementation, potentially cutting SoC vendors like Qualcomm out of the update process. Since time immemorial, the Android ecosystem has made quickly updating an operating system across devices seem like an impossible task. Google releases a new version of Android, and while Nexus and Pixel devices get updated, other Android OEMs mostly shrug their shoulders and go about their business. If users are lucky, they might get an OS update six months down the line, at which point Google has already moved on to an even newer version of Android. Ahead of Google I/O, Google has just dropped a bombshell of a blog post that promises, for real this time, that it is finally doing something about Android's update problems. "Project Treble" is a plan to modularize the Android OS, separating the OS framework code from "vendor specific" hardware code. In theory, this change would allow for a new Android update to be flashed on a device without any involvement from the silicon vendor. Google calls it "the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date," and it's already live on the Google Pixel's Android O Developer Preview. This is not a magic bullet that will solve all of Android's update problems, however. After an update is released, Google lists three steps to creating an Android update: Silicon manufacturers (Qualcomm, Samsung Exynos, etc) "modify the new release for their specific hardware" and do things like make sure drivers and power management will still work. OEMs (Samsung, LG, HTC) step in and "modify the new release again as needed for their devices." This means making sure all the hardware works, rebranding Android with a custom skin, adding OEM apps, and modifying core parts of the Android OS to add special features like (before 7.0) multi-window support. Carriers add more apps, more branding, and "test and certify the new release." Further ReadingTo solve Android’s update woes, Google should look to the PCProject Treble is only addressing "step 1." Google and silicon manufacturers have finally created a stable "vendor interface" that the hardware and OS can plug into, a move we've suggested implementing in the past. Just as Google has OEMs pass a "Compatibility Test Suite" (CTS) that ensures that third-party Android apps can run on their OS implementation, silicon vendors will now have a "Vendor Test Suite" (VTS) that ensures "forward compatibility of the vendor implementation." Google says that VTS-compliant vendors can "choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers." For now, there aren't many details, but Google says it will release the full documentation for Treble when the final version of Android O launches later this year. "No additional work from the silicon vendors" is only a third of the battle, though. Steps two and three above will still be issues. While VTS-compliant silicon vendors can choose to easily update to a new Android OS, Project Treble would only enable a "hands-off" OS update if OEMs use unmodified stock Android. Treble does not address skinning, custom apps, custom features, or any other changes to the core OS. Companies like Samsung will still change every single piece of the Android UI and add custom features, creating lots of work for themselves when update time comes along. Further ReadingHey Google, want to fix Android updates? Hit OEMs where it hurtsMotivation is also still a problem. OEMs and carriers will still be a roadblock in the way of updates, and they are still free to drag their feet when it comes to updating older models. Google's blog post notes, "One thing we've consistently heard from our device-maker partners is that updating existing devices to a new version of Android is incredibly time consuming and costly." Updating Android will still be costly because OEMs and carriers will still be in the loop, and, because updating a device has a negative effect on companies' bottom lines, they're not motivated to actually do it. This also isn't the first time Google has promised to improve Android's update situation. The "Android Update Alliance"—a group of OEMs that totally pinky sweared to do a better job at delivering updates—was announced at I/O and was then immediately forgotten about. Further ReadingWhy isn’t your old phone getting Nougat? There’s blame enough to go aroundStill, this program sounds like a big help for Android's update situation, and it could carve out one step of the three-step process. If nothing else, it should help Google phones directly. Currently, Google phones like the Pixel are limited to only two years of major OS updates. This is pretty bad compared to Apple's update system, which has hit five years of support for some iOS devices. The "two-year update plan" is something that the entire Android ecosystem has mostly settled on, but, as Google describes, the first step in changing this would be to get Qualcomm to support an SoC for more than two years. With Project Treble enabled on the Pixel phones, Google now has no one to blame other than itself for the Pixels getting end-of-life'd. If consumers pressure Google to provide more than two years of major OS updates, the company can now totally do it. "Is this device Project Treble enabled?" is something we're going to have to ask at every single launch event from now on. OEMs can now be the first one to blame when an update doesn't arrive, and it should stop some of the finger-pointing that happens when consumers ask where their update is. Android O is clearly required, but it's very interesting that the Pixel phones were updated to include Project Treble. This means it's possible for devices like the Galaxy S8 to be updated with Treble as well. Now we get to see which OEMs really care about updates. No more excuses.

An angry run-in with a podcaster earns Jackie community service at a soup kitchen, where he strikes sparks with the daughter (Leslie Mann) of a real-estate mogul (Harvey Keitel). In addition to DeNiro’s killer turn as a celebrity fighting against the dying of the light, there’s plenty of incidental pleasures, including cameos by folks who’ve co-starred with DeNiro in previous projects. Flaws and all, “The Comedian” is a must-watch. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu. Also New to VOD and Streaming Fifty Shades Darker: The last time we saw Anastasia (Dakota Johnson) and her S&M-loving billionaire boyfriend Christian (Jamie Dornan), they had severed their “arrangement” and were going their separate ways. But, this being a franchise, the couple is back together again for more drama, with Anastasia agreeing to reconcile on the condition that there are “no rules, no punishment and no more secrets.” Even though director Sam Taylor-Johnson has been replaced by James Foley (“Glengarry Glen Ross”), “Fifty Shades” is essentially more of the same, with Anastasia once again trying to save Christian from himself. Advertisement Expect kinky sex, opulence and a smidge more humor than in the first installment. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu Paris 05:59: Theo (Geoffrey Couet) and Hugo (Francois Nabmo) might have the strangest courtship in the history of cinema. They lock eyes in a crowed Paris sex club and quickly enjoy a bout of passionate love-making. Afterwards, they go their separate ways, at least until they wind up in the emergency room where they re-connect over vending machine coffee. Soon, they’re strolling through the streets of early-morning Paris. Given the film’s explicit opening, it’s miraculous how the drama slowly transforms into such a sweet-natured love story. Not since “Before Sunrise,” has a movie captured so sensitively, in real time, the intricacies of falling in love. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu Holy Hell: If you’ve ever wondered what life inside a cult would be like, check out this mesmerizing documentary directed by Will Allen, who spent 22 years as the in-house filmmaker for a mysterious, speedo-wearing “spiritual” guide named Michel. Allen was just out of film school when he joined a West Hollywood community that promised answers to some of life’s toughest questions. It would take more than two decades for Allen to realize the extent to which he was being manipulated. “Holy Hell” benefits not only from revealing interviews with former cult members but creepy footage of the groups’ rituals and retreats. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu MindGamers: A potentially fascinating premise about human minds being linked by a quantum computer is squandered in this sci-fi spectacle which is all flash and no substance. Even though “MindGamers” make some interesting comparisons between religion and science, it’s not enough to sustain a movie that occasionally feels like “The Matrix” remade as a video game. On Amazon, Google, iTunes and Vudu Small Crimes: After serving time for the attempted murder of a District Attorney, disgraced former cop Joe Denton (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) returns home looking for redemption. But Joe quickly finds himself trapped in the cross fire between a crooked sheriff, a vengeful DA, and a mafia kingpin. Expects heaps of tension and atmosphere. On Neftlix. The Great War: This six-hour World War I documentary, which was originally broadcast on PBS, explores the conflict from a handful of fresh angles. In addition to chronicling the experiences of the American troops who became known as “doughboys,” the series delves into the little-known participation of African-American and Latino soldiers as well as suffragists and Native American “code talkers.” There’s also plenty of compelling information about how the War abroad led to a crackdown of civil liberties at home.

Thomson) and sent to live on Canada’s bucolic Prince Edward Island. Walley-Beckett takes a remarkably adult approach to Montgomery’s book in an effort to expose the often troubling psychological issues which helped shape Anne’s personality. If the series clicks, Netflix promises four more seasons. On Netflix.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri duke it out… Cortana, Google Assistant, and Siri duke it out (now, with more Alexa!) By Digital Trends Staff — Updated May 12, 2017 8:51 am Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Nearly every smartphone and computer on the market today has a smart assistant trapped inside, like a helpful ghost, but how do they stack up against one another? While it may seem like Siri, Cortana, and the nameless Google Assistant are all just variations of the same thing — and well, they are to some extent — they each have their own quirks, flaws, and strengths. So which one’s best for you? Well, that’s not an easy question to answer, as they’re so similar it’s hard to compare them without digging deep into their capabilities. That said, let’s get started. Virtual assistants compared Cortana Cortana is an operating system-oriented voice assistant available on Windows 10 devices, as well as the Xbox One console. Cortana is closely connected to productivity, but can also help answer more general questions by pulling information by Bing. The Cortana VA has seen a lot of recent growth, expanding her use throughout Windows 10 and related services. Combined with newer offerings like Surface Studio, it’s clear Microsoft favors Cortana as an OS-based service to control Windows 10 while you’re working. While you can store specific bits of information with Cortana, Microsoft’s virtual assistant is constantly analyzing your interactions to learn more about you. This info is stored in something Microsoft calls the “Notebook,” which includes the places you like to go, people you care about, your preferred quiet hours, and things you might be interested in, among other things. You can even edit it if you like. Cortana can also read your emails, track your location, watch your browsing history, check your contact list, keep an eye on your calendar, and put all this data together to suggest useful info, if you allow it to. Cortana is designed to recognize context, so it should be able to understand follow-up requests, and you can phrase things in different ways and still expect a useful answer. You can also type your questions or requests, if you prefer to not speak out loud. The latest changes from the Windows 10 Creators Update allow Cortana to help in the setup process for new computers, and include a new full screen mode for Cortana that serves as both a screensaver and voice-assistant focused mode when you’re away from the computer—or at too far away to type. Cortana can also handle music and reminder commands more effectively, spanning multiple music apps and controlling volume as you desire. Passive abilities have also gotten a boost, including Action Center (the right-hand Windows menu) syncing, where Cortana will sync activities from one computer to another so you can pick up where you left off more easily. These updates and others make Cortana a desktop-friendly assistant with a specialty in work-related tasks. Of course, she also works for Xbox One and is available via app on many platforms, so there are plenty of options here. However, unlike some voice assistants, Cortana does not yet have much of an interest in smart home or IoT devices. There are rumors that will soon change, but nothing has been announced as of this article’s latest update. Siri Siri has been an integral part of iOS since the launch of iOS 5 in 2011. It started with the basics such as weather and messaging, but has expanded greatly since then to support more third-party integration with MacOS. While Siri’s jokes are legendary, the virtual assistant is getting more capable every day. Now, you can ask it to call people, send messages, schedule meetings, launch apps and games, play music, answer questions, set reminders, and provide weather forecasts. Siri can also integrate with third-party apps and understand follow-up queries. That’s a big change in strategy for Apple, which typically maintains a tight grip on which third-party companies get access to its native functions. Siri is probably the most familiar of all the voice assistants, but it’s also seeing fewer in-house updates, and less expansion into new areas (although Siri support via Apple Homekit is available, which is a welcome development). It also lags behind the other VAs when it comes to text input, which isn’t supported for most Siri functions: Apple appears to be using Siri for voice controls and Spotlight for similar text-based queries. The latest news for Siri includes voice compatibility for WhatsApp, expanded payment options for Lyft and Uber, and the ability to look up international cricket scores. These are minor tweaks compared to the changes other VAs are going through, but they also point to Siri’s continued stability—particularly for long-term iOS users who already know the voice assistant well. Google Assistant Google Assistant (which has incorporated functions from the older Google Now, as Now is being phased out) is different from Cortana and Siri. It has less personality, but more functionality. While it is an integral part of Android, Google Assistant also lives in an iOS app, and can be accessed through the Chrome browser as needed. Like Cortana and Siri, you can ask Assistant for directions to the closest Chinese restaurant, or what the weather looks like for the next 10 days. If you let it, Google’s software will utilize your search history and customize its responses based on what it knows about your queries. Google’s integration with its search engine makes Google Assistant one of the most useful virtual assistants out of the box. Unless you’ve never used Google as a search engine before, it already has a treasure trove of data on what you’ve done on the web. It also reacts to questions in a similar way to the Google browser, which makes it great for general information and trivia. The release of Google Home makes comparisons between Google Assistant and Alexa easy, but Assistant is in wearables and the latest Android mobile devices, so it has a broader reach than Amazon’s VA.  If you favor Android platforms on anything from phones to TVs, then Assistant has a compelling argument. The highly conversational VA is adept at interpreting common languages and understanding the meaning behind subtly complex questions like, “What should we have for dinner?” It can also recognize up to six different voices for couples and families, each voice tied to different calendar events and preferences, an advantage unique to Assistant and ideal in a situation where everyone uses the voice assistant on a single device. The latest updates to Assistant includes a quick change to stop saving shopping lists on Keep (in favor of Express, which competes more directly with Amazon), and a new ability to set flight price tracking alerts. This shows some uncertainty as to where Assistant is headed. Does Google want it to be an Alexa competitor, or does Google want to tie it into existing Chrome/Android services? Assistant is shuffling its feet a little at this stage, but it certainly provides unique advantages for Google fans.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > Selling your phone or tablet? Here’s how to… Selling your phone or tablet? Here’s how to completely wipe your Android device By Simon Hill — Updated May 12, 2017 12:01 pm Subscribe Share Simon Hill / Digital Trends Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Our smartphones are privy to some of our most important secrets. Sensitive business emails, financial details, contact information, and perhaps even a risqué photo are not things you want falling into the wrong hands. Performing a factory reset is always a good idea, but it might not always be enough. When the security firm Avast bought 20 Android smartphones from eBay, for example, it was able to recover photos, Google searches, emails, text messages, and contact details. We’re going to show you how to make sure that can’t happen to you. Factory Reset Protection You’ll want to start by removing Factory Reset Protection (FRP). Google introduced FRP in Android 5.0 Lollipop as an extra layer of security. It’s designed to prevent thieves from being able to steal your phone, wipe it, and then use it or sell it. When you factory reset a phone with FRP enabled and try to set it up as a new device, you’ll be prompted to enter the user name and password for the last Google account that was registered on the device. If you don’t have those details, then the phone will remain locked and you can’t gain access. Obviously, this is no good if you’re trying to sell it or give it away. Here’s how to disable it: This step will differ slightly depending on your phone. On a Samsung Galaxy, go to Settings > Lock screen and security > Screen lock type and choose None. On an LG G6, go to Settings > Display > Lock screen > Select screen lock and choose None. On a Google Pixel, go to Settings > Personal > Security > Screen lock and choose None. The next thing you must do is remove your Google account. On a Samsung Galaxy, go to Settings > Cloud & accounts > Accounts and tap on Google, then tap the three vertical dots in the upper right or More > Remove account. On an LG G6 or a Google Pixel, go to Settings > Accounts & sync > Google and tap the three vertical dots in the upper right, then tap Remove account. If you have more than one Google account registered with your phone, then make sure you remove all of them. If you have a Samsung Galaxy, then you should remove your Samsung account, too. To do this, go to Settings > Lock screen and security > Find My Mobile. Then, enter your password, tap on your account at the top, and select More > Remove account. Once your Google and Samsung accounts have been removed, you can proceed with the factory reset. How does a factory reset work? When you do a factory reset on your Android smartphone, it’s supposed to wipe it clean, but it doesn’t. It deletes the addresses of all of your data, so it no longer knows where it’s stored, but it doesn’t actually overwrite the data. That being the case, it’s possible for someone to employ off-the-shelf recovery software and get some of that data back. Let’s look at how to wipe your Android smartphone properly. Encrypt your data The first step is to encrypt your data. This option is built in to Android, and requires you to enter a PIN or password every time you turn your phone on. It means that anyone attempting to recover data from your phone after you will need a special key to decrypt it, and they won’t have the key. Fully charge your phone or keep it plugged in to the charger while this process is running, because it can take several hours depending on how much data you have. The exact method for navigating this next step will differ slightly from phone to phone. It will generally be Settings > Security > Encrypt phone. But on a Samsung Galaxy, for example, you want to go to Settings > Lock screen & security > Protect encrypted data. You have the option to encrypt the SD card as well, but if you’re passing the phone on, we would recommend removing it instead. If your phone came with Android 6.0 Marshmallow or above, it should be encrypted by default, and you can skip to the next section. If you’re unsure about which version of Android your phone is running, then take a look in Settings > About device/phone > Software info. Keep in mind that it will only be encrypted by default if Android 6.0 Marshmallow was installed out of the box. Factory reset the phone Make sure that you have anything you want to keep backed up before you do this because it will wipe everything. Go to Settings > Backup & reset > Factory data reset and then tap Reset phone or Reset device. When the process is done, your phone will be wiped and any data that could be recovered will be encrypted and should be impossible to decrypt. It’s now safe to sell your Android smartphone, or pass it along to someone else. Overwriting with junk data If you want to be absolutely certain, you can overwrite the encrypted data with junk data and then perform another factory reset — then it would be genuinely impossible to recover any of your old data. This is probably overkill. If you want to do it, however, then simply load a bunch of dummy data onto your phone until the storage is full — a few large videos should do the trick — and then perform another factory reset. You can also get an app to do it for you. There are a few options in the Play Store, such as Secure Erase with iShredder 5. There you have it. That’s how you completely wipe your Android phone. Let us know if you have a better technique. Updated on 05-12-2017 by Simon Hill: Added methods for LG G6 and Google Pixel.

That’s the dream, really – for those that wish to get Android updates. Google has announced this week that they’re initiating a so-called “Project Treble” to make that a reality. Project Treble team lead Iliyan Malchev suggests that starting with Android O, all devices will be coming with Project Treble. Treble takes the messed-up vision of Android OS framework updates that is today and fixes it. The simplest way to explain this is with the following pair of images. There, Google shows how until now, vendors had to do work to get Android updates to users. Vendor-implemented Android needed to go with the update. With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android,” said Treble head Iliyan Malchev, “device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers. With Treble, Google is able to deliver updates to Android OS a whole lot more efficiently than ever before. Why it wasn’t like this since the beginning of Android, we might never know. The entire story on how we got this far – that’s the real question here. “Android was unveiled in 2007 as a free, open-source mobile operating system. From the beginning, we intended Android to be scaled across a variety of manufacturers.” said Malchev. “We knew that consistency of API was important for developers, so we created a compatibility program for the Developer API specified by the Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) and its associated Compatibility Test Suite (CTS), now comprising over a million tests.” “The result today is that app developers can write a single app that works across over a billion devices running on different hardware from different manufacturers.” said Malchev. “Project Treble aims to do what CTS did for apps, for the Android OS framework.” The end result is quicker updates from Google and a situation that’s a bit more like what Apple has in play. Sort of what Apple has with iOS being their own software on their own hardware and that making software updates relatively swift and semi-universal, that is to say.

As of May 2, almost a year after it was first announced, only 7.1% of Android devices worldwide are running Android Nougat (7.0 and 7.1). Google is acutely aware of this and believes it has found a way for manufacturers to speed the process up for the forthcoming Android O update. Related: Google I/O 2017 Google is describing its Project Treble platform, announced in a blog post today, as a “modular base for Android,” which is the “biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” The idea is to streamline the process for silicon makers, manufacturers who’ve told Google “updating existing devices to a new version of Android is incredibly time consuming and costly.” For reference, here's what the update process currently looks like: Google says Project Treble will make the Android framework more like the apps landscape, where a developer can write a single app that can run on millions of different pieces of hardware. In the blog post Google adds: “With a stable vendor interface providing access to the hardware-specific parts of Android, device makers can choose to deliver a new Android release to consumers by just updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers” Google says it’ll release more information about Project Treble this summer, but says it’s already built into the Android O preview. It’s likely we’ll hear more about this at Google I/O next week. Would this make you more inclined to buy an Android O phone?

Google offers sneak peek at Android 8 in first developer... Video Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6 Camera Shootout If there’s one thing we hate about our non-Pixel Android phones, it’s the lack of regular and speedy updates. Whenever a new version of Android comes out, even just a small one, it takes LG, Samsung, Sony, HTC, and everyone else months to push out an update to their latest phones. And if you don’t have a flagship phone, you’re lucky to get an update at all. But a major change coming to Android O might make our hand-wringing a thing of the past. In a post on its developer’s blog, Google unveiled a sneak peek at Project Treble, which it says is “the biggest change to the low-level system architecture of Android to date.” In a nutshell, it aims to significantly lessen the burden on third-party phone manufacturers so they can deliver updates in a timely fashion. All about that Treble: While we still have a long time to wait to see if Project Treble actually does what Google says it will, for the first time since Android launched, we have hope. By removing much of the legwork required by manufacturers to push out a new update to Android, devices that ship with Android O should have a much easier time adhering to Google’s security and version upgrade schedule.  Treble yell As Google describes, the current process is enormously time-consuming, forcing phone makers to not only update their own implementation but also Google’s OS framework. Basically, there are five steps to follow each time a new version of Android is released: The Android team publishes the open-source code for the latest release to the world. Silicon manufacturers, the companies that make the chips that power Android devices, modify the new release for their specific hardware. Silicon manufacturers pass the modified new release to device makers—the companies that design and manufacture Android devices. Device makers modify the new release again as needed for their devices. Device makers work with carriers to test and certify the new release. Device makers and carriers make the new release available to users. Under the new system, Google is boiling those steps down to just one. The core concept involves separating the vendor implementation, which is the device-specific software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers, from the Android OS Framework. Starting with new devices that ship with Android O, Google will introduce a new “vendor interface” between Android and the unique device implementations that will provide access to the hardware-specific parts of Android. That means device makers will be able to push out new Android releases “without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers.” Google Project Treble lets device manufacturers focus only on the parts of Android that affect their phones. Google is basing the system on its Compatibility Test Suite, the system that allows developers to push a single app to hundreds of different phones and tablets, regardless of screen size and hardware. As Google describes, “Project Treble aims to do what CTS did for apps, for the Android OS framework.” In addition to the architectural changes, Google is working with its partners to move their code changes into the common Android Open Source Project codebase. As Google describes, Sony and Qualcomm have already contributed “dozens of features and hundreds of bug fixes to Android O,” so they won’t have to redo their work with each new Android release. Google plans to publish the full documentation for Project Treble on source.android.com with the launch of O later this summer. But we expect to hear a lot more about it at Google I/O next week.  To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

From lawsuits to allegations of sexual harassment to a federal investigation into claims that it has used a fake version of its app to thwart authorities, Uber has had a rough year. (Photo: Seth Wenig / AP, file) CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Allegations that Uber has been using self-driving car technology stolen from Google has been referred by a federal judge to the U.S. attorney’s office for a potential criminal investigation. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco made the referral in an order posted Thursday night as he ruled on several motions in a lawsuit against Uber by Waymo, which is Google parent Alphabet Inc.’s autonomous car unit. “This case is referred to the United States Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC’s claims for trade secret misappropriation,” Alsup wrote in the order. “The court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney.” Neither Uber nor Waymo would comment specifically on the judge’s referral. The high-stakes corporate espionage case revolves around Waymo’s allegations that Uber’s work on self-driving cars has been riding on trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing details about a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what’s around them. Waymo has alleged in its lawsuit that Levandowski and Uber conspired to create a sham self-driving truck startup called Otto as a prelude to a $680 million deal for Uber to buy Otto and get the desperately needed technology. After Uber bought Otto, Levandowski took over oversight of Uber’s self-driving car division. He stepped down from the role earlier this month until Waymo’s lawsuit is resolved. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo’s ideas, maintaining that its Lidar system is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to turn over his personal laptop or answer most other questions posed by Waymo’s lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Also Thursday, Alsup issued a ruling on Waymo’s request for an order to stop Uber’s work on autonomous vehicles while the lawsuit is decided, but the ruling was temporarily sealed because it contained confidential information. A case synopsis said the judge granted part of Waymo’s request but also denied part. In addition, Alsup denied Uber’s request to force the high-tech corporate espionage lawsuit out of court and into arbitration. Alsup ruled that Waymo has taken Levandowski to arbitration, and a separate lawsuit was the only course available to sue Uber. In a statement, Waymo, called Uber’s arbitration request a “desperate bid” to avoid the court. “We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,” the statement said. But Uber said it’s unfortunate that Waymo can avoid an arbitration promise that it requires employees to make. “We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum.” CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

Called Project Treble, Google’s new effort aims to separate the custom lower-level software from device makers and silicon manufacturers from the core Android OS framework. Manufacturers must currently update that lower-level software with each new Android OS framework release, but that won’t be the case with Treble. Project Treble will utilize a new vendor interface to separate the core Android OS framework and lower-level vendor software. Because the device-specific software will be separated from the core Android OS framework, OEMs should be able to just plug in the updated Android OS framework and leave their custom software alone, which should save them time and hopefully lead to faster updates. Here’s what Google has to say about Project Treble: “The core concept is to separate the vendor implementation - the device-specific, lower-level software written in large part by the silicon manufacturers - from the Android OS Framework. This is achieved by the introduction of a new vendor interface between the Android OS framework and the vendor implementation. The new vendor interface is validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS), analogous to the CTS, to ensure forward compatibility of the vendor implementation.” Project Treble will be included with all new devices that launch with Android O. The new architecture is already on Google Pixel phones running the Android O Developer Preview, so there are already phones out there running Project Treble. This is a major update to the low-level Android architecture. It’s good to see Google making such a big change, though, because despite the company’s past efforts to speed up software updates, some devices are still slow to receive Android OS updates. We’ll have to wait and see if Project Treble actually makes a difference, but what we’ve heard so far sounds promising.

The answer is a feature inside of Android O called “Project Treble,” which is supposed to let manufacturers update their phones without having to make a ton of software changes first. Google has essentially split apart its own work on Android from the work that its hardware partners do on Android to make sure it works with their latest chips. If Treble works like Google says it does, companies like Samsung and Motorola will be able to issue Android updates without waiting for a chip partner, like Qualcomm, to first send along software updates. Image: Google It’s not clear if this removes all hurdles or if manufacturers will still have to update Android’s code to make sure that features specific to their phone are working. But it certainly sounds like one of the most concrete things Google has done to address the problem of Android fragmentation. While the fragmentation situation has gotten better over time, it certainly hasn’t gone away: the latest version of Android, Nougat, has been out for more than eight months and is still on only 7 percent of Android phones. Android Jelly Bean, which was succeeded almost four years ago, is on more devices than that. Image: Google Google has tried to speed up Android updates in the past without much luck, so this is still very much something we have to wait and see on. And perhaps more importantly, there’s still one big hurdle: this feature arrives in Android O, and who knows when any existing phones will get updated to the new OS. We’ll hear more about Treble at Google’s I/O conference next week. The company should be talking more about Android O there, too, though the operating system likely won’t see a full release until later in the year.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) DETROIT • Allegations that Uber has been using self-driving car technology stolen from Google has been referred by a federal judge to the U.S. attorney's office for a potential criminal investigation. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco made the referral in an order posted Thursday night as he ruled on several motions in a lawsuit against Uber by Waymo, which is Google parent Alphabet Inc.'s autonomous car unit. "This case is referred to the United States Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation," Alsup wrote in the order. "The court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney." Neither Uber nor Waymo would comment specifically on the judge's referral Thursday night. The high-stakes corporate espionage case revolves around Waymo's allegations that Uber's work on self-driving cars has been riding on trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing details about a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Waymo has alleged in its lawsuit that Levandowski and Uber conspired to create a sham self-driving truck startup called Otto as a prelude to a $680 million deal for Uber to buy Otto and get the desperately needed technology. After Uber bought Otto, Levandowski took over oversight of Uber's self-driving car division. He stepped down from the role earlier this month until Waymo's lawsuit is resolved. See how St. Louis stocks are faring Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar system is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to turn over his personal laptop or answer most other questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Also Thursday, Alsup issued a ruling on Waymo's request for an order to stop Uber's work on autonomous vehicles while the lawsuit is decided, but the ruling was temporarily sealed because it contained confidential information. A case synopsis said the judge granted part of Waymo's request but also denied part. In addition, Alsup denied Uber's request to force the high-tech corporate espionage lawsuit out of court and into arbitration. Alsup ruled that Waymo has taken Levandowski to arbitration, and a separate lawsuit was the only course available to sue Uber. In a statement, Waymo called Uber's arbitration request a "desperate bid" to avoid the court. "We welcome the court's decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct," the statement said. But Uber said it's unfortunate that Waymo can avoid an arbitration promise that it requires employees to make. "We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum." Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

The secret is to charge more money for workshops. I think workshops are great for photographers because nowadays people want to spend money on experiences and people want to learn. A lot of photographers like to complain that the Internet has messed up the photo industry, that nowadays “everyone is a photographer.” I say f**k that, everyone is a photographer. Your mom with her iPhone is a photographer. We’ve got several billion photographers in the world, and anyone with a smartphone camera is a photographer. To me, this is a massive opportunity. In a future world where 7 billion people own a camera, you are going to have several billion people wanting to learn how to make better photos. And there are a lot of really rich people who want to learn how to make better photos. And there are a lot of rich people who want experiences. They don’t care about spending a bunch of money on an expensive camera — they want to travel, meet other passionate people, and to also learn from photographers they admire. 2. How I make money I have monetized my photography by teaching workshops, selling products via my brand HAPTIC INDUSTRIES, and also through Amazon affiliate links (which earns around $600 to $1,000 a month as of 2017) — so if someone buys a photo book through my recommendation, or whenever anyone buys anything on Amazon through my link, I get a 3% commission. So someone can click an Amazon link on my site and buy baby diapers, and I get a 2-3% commission on that. 3. Alienate people I used to want everyone to attend my workshops, because of course as a self-interested human being, I want to make more money to better myself and my family. But I soon learned that it’s better to not want everyone to attend your workshops, and not want people to buy your products. The reason is simple: you only need a very small percentage of your audience or followers (lets say 1%) to buy your stuff or attend your workshops. For example, let’s say I have 90,000 Facebook fans. 1% of that audience is 900 individuals. Perhaps half of those people will actually buy something, or attend a workshop. But that is still massive. But honestly, if you want to make a living from your passion (let’s say photography) you might only need only $40,000 a year to make a living (and not a killing). So for me in the past, I only needed 50 people to attend a workshop to earn about $40,000 a year. So just think to yourself: you only need 50 dedicated followers to attend your workshop, or buy your (expensive) products to make a living. 4. Find a thrifty life partner The biggest tip I have for making a lot of money and getting rich is having a thrifty/economical partner. My wife Cindy taught me to save money and not to go out and buy Leicas. I have a personal rule: if I want to spend more than $300 on anything, I need Cindy’s explicit permission. I know I can’t trust myself, and it has worked very well so far. So a secret to getting “rich” (financially) is to reduce your expenses. The only reason Cindy and I have been able to accumulate more than $100,000 in savings is because we spend very little money on ourselves. 5. Everyone starts with 0 followers I started my blog in 2011 with 0 followers and 0 page views, and 0 social media followers. It takes a long time to build up an audience. To build up an audience from 0, I wrote 1 street photography tips article every Monday, every Wednesday I interviewed 1 photographer, and every Friday I shared photos from the social media community. After about a year of constant blogging 3 times a week, I was able to build a small, yet dedicated audience. 6. Why you should start your own blog Now, I have disabled all of my pageview trackers and whatnot on my blog. This is because I get emotional with numbers: the days my pageviews go up, I feel high. The days it goes down, I feel like s**t. So I just realized the simple solution was to disable my stats and pageviews. Now, I follow my own gut, and feel liberated. I also recommend you to start your own blog, and to own your own platform, the only way to get discovered by others on Google. And no, I do not pay Google to appear high on search results. The only way to rank high in Google is to write really useful stuff, and the more people who link to your site, the higher your site ranks in Google (like how academic papers work). Also a secret: I’ve written over 2,600 blog posts from 2011 through 2017. That helps too. 7. Social media is overrated Another lesson: social media is overrated. 90% of my audience discovers me through Google, not Facebook or Instagram. So while I recommend that it’s good to have a “social media presence”, only focus 10% of your attention on that. For the other 90%, focus on blogging, finding clients, and figuring out ways to actually make money. And not only that, don’t waste time focusing on “marketing” yourself — just make great art. The quality of your own art and photos will be the best marketing for yourself. 8. Why you should start a YouTube channel Also, I do think it is a good idea to start your own YouTube channel. It is free marketing for yourself (and I recommend not putting on ads on YouTube, as it’s annoying and it will deter people from watching your videos and learning more about your message, ethics, and morals). I make YouTube videos that are fun to me. I have intentionally turned off ads on my YouTube, because I hate ads. I think it is better to have people watch your videos on YouTube (without ads), and learn how to trust you and then eventually buy your products or attend your workshop, rather than to just earn a few dollars here and there. My crazy ambition is to create a trillion dollars worth of “value” in the photography world. I want to own the #1 photography website on the Internet. I therefore know in order to do that, I don’t want put paywalls on the information on my site. To me, an open system is always better than a closed one. This is why I believe in “open source photography” and have even made a free photography boot camp. 9. How to make your own luck “Luck is when preparation meets opportunity.” You can make your own luck. The more you swing the bat, the more likely you are to hit a home run. The sad reality is, if you are never given opportunity, you can never have the opportunity to make a lot of money and also become the best version of yourself. You can hustle f**king hard and still not become financially “successful.” I got very lucky. I started my blog when nothing much was being written on street photography. In the course of 6 years (2011 to 2017), I was able to become #2 on Google for “street photography” because I’ve written a lot of articles on street photography (especially my “Learn From the Masters of Street Photography” series) and from my free photography ebooks. 10. Free or Expensive The biggest principle I believe in is this: it is better to give away your stuff for free or to charge a lot of money for it. My buddy Nassim Taleb calls this the “Barbell Theory.” So for example, I give away all the information on my website for free, but I charge a LOT of money for a workshop experience or HAPTIC PRODUCT. Many individuals make the mistake of trying to “nickel and dime you” for every little thing. Avoid charging a “medium” price or a “moderate” price on anything. I actually predict that the future is going to be polarized. Either everything will be free (for the masses) or really expensive (for the rich). If you look at society, the middle class is dying. 50 years from now (if capitalism keeps marching forward) there will only be really poor people (subsidized) or really rich people (those who control the “means of production”). Consider the fact that you can buy a $10 bag on Amazon or a $100,000 Hermes handbag. Or you can have a smartphone camera on your iPhone or spend $10,000 on a digital Leica camera. The future is going to be luxury goods or free. 11. The death of the photographic middle class There is going to be a death of the photographic middle class. Those photographers just charging “medium” prices will die off. You will have a future with $100 medium format digital cameras that everyone can afford. 18-year-old kids will shoot weddings for $500. And they will be damn good. And poor people will pay that. And the rich will spend $50,0000 on a wedding or commercial/fashion/editorial shoot. 12. Have faith in yourself Ultimately, the most important thing is to have a hustler’s mentality. To have supreme confidence in yourself (almost to the point of radical foolishness). If you want to innovate and make a living from your passion, you need to be a little crazy. When I lost my cozy $40,000 a year job in 2011 and decided to pursue photography full-time through blogging, everyone thought I was crazy. But I am so grateful to then-girlfriend Cindy and my mom for believing in me. And my friend Kevin McKenzie for telling me that he would do everything to help support me. You cannot control whether you will become rich or even “succeed,” but you can control how hard you hustle. When you are looking into the dark pit of despair, believe in yourself. You can do it. Not only that, but never stop hustling. If you really want to make a living from your passion, it will likely be f**king hard. You will not see the back of your eyelids for at least a year or two. I know for myself, when I first lost my job in 2011, I worked 12 to 14 hours a day. I used this time to make photos, blog, make videos, send emails, build connections, and trying to figure out ways to make money. Even now in 2017, I have doubled down on my hustle. The other day I woke up at 5:30am, and drank 5-6 cups of (Vietnamese) coffee, and crashed at around 5:30pm. I worked essentially non-stop with the hope of creating information that will empower my followers. This is why I live: I believe in you, and you can really change society and the world, as well as earn your freedom through owning your own business. Conclusion Money isn’t going to buy you happiness, but in today’s world, it will buy you (some) freedom. I know for me, being broke sucked. I grew up poor as a 12-year-old kid. Now that I am rich(er), I can be more generous helping friends, family, and helping give back to society by keeping my information open and free. You might wonder, why did Eric write this article? Is it for more pageviews, for more people to buy his products, and “free” marketing for his workshops? Yes. No, but seriously, the reason I wrote this is to encourage you and say that with enough hustle (and a touch of luck) you can earn (more) than $200,000 a year from your passion. If I can do it, you can do it too, and even better than me. About the author: Eric Kim is an international street photographer. The opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author.

As a result, users can learn all they need to know in this Android Nougat vs Android 6.0 Marshmallow walkthrough and comparison. This is a detailed list of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow vs Android 7 Nougat on the Nexus 6P. Here we will detail some of the new features and improvements Google has made in Android Nougat, 7.1 and now the Android 7.1.2 Nougat release. There are over 50 changes, but only a few are visual. Many behind the scenes tweaks will make a big difference for Samsung, HTC and LG smartphone owners. Among others. Read: How to Fix Bad Nexus Android Nougat Battery Life Google’s Android 6.0 Marshmallow update was released in October 2015 after a long beta period, and Android 7.0 Nougat was released on August 22nd. It adds multiple impressive features and improves on the overall design. Additionally, Android 7.1.1 was released on December 5th, followed by a beta of 7.1.2 in January. As 2017 continues more and more manufacturers have started to release updates. Android 7.0 Nougat first debuted back on March 9th at Google IO. Earlier than prior years in an effort to release it faster than ever before. The beta previews allowed for faster development, more bug fixes and the earlier release we’ve seen in quite a while. Alternatively, those same betas were done by Samsung, LG and many other companies looking to fast-track software updates. The LG G5 is getting Android 7.0 right now on multiple carriers, if it didn’t get it back in December. Moto Z & G users have the latest release and so do HTC smartphones. Now that we’re in February of 2017 the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge Android Nougat is rolling out to millions of phones. All of those owners will want to know what to expect. If so, read on for our comparison. Read: 95 Best Android Apps & Games Now that many Nexus and Pixel phones are on Android 7.1.1, others are up next. Although all the other updates arriving right now are Android 7.0 and not 7.1.1 Nougat. Once the initial update arrives, smaller releases and patches will follow. Expect carriers and manufacturers to continue working hard on updates as 2017 continues. Then, we’ll start getting Android 7.1.2 later this year or in the summer. For now though, almost all major smartphones released in 2016 are running Android 7.0 Nougat, or are getting updates as we speak or the coming days and weeks. Which is why the information below will be so helpful. Android 7.0 or Android 7.1 Nougat is a free software update for all smartphones and tablets that can support it. After the beta period we expected updates to arrive faster this time around, but that hasn’t been the case. Many did get it within three months, but major players like Samsung still took longer than expected. However, now that we’re halfway into February almost all carriers are sending multiple Nougat updates out to select devices. That’s good news. What’s New in Android Nougat Currently the Android 7.1.2 Nougat release is only available for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player and the Pixel C tablet. As well as the Pixel phones. Three missing from that list are: the Nexus 5, Nexus 7 (2013) and the Nexus 10. We’ve recently learned the Nexus 5 won’t officially get the update to Android 7.0 at all. At least not from Google. Then, the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 received 7.1.1 but won’t get 7.1.2 Nougat. All other non-Google phones are getting the initial release from August of 2016. Additionally, Android 7.1 is available on the Google Pixel, Nexus 5x, Nexus 6P and Pixel C. Other devices on Nougat are running Android 7.0 and not Google’s latest maintenance update. Some of the most noteworthy new features are split-screen multitasking and multi-window mode. This works great and supports all apps, not just select few like we see on Samsung or LG devices. Another huge addition to N is Android Instant Apps, which we’re starting to see go live recently. This enables Android to install small bits of an app ( from a search result or web link) and allow one-time instant app usage. No installing an app and starting over. Android just adds what it needs for that moment, uses the app, and you’re done. It discards it once finished. Other changes include improved battery life again with a more efficient “Doze” on-the-go mode, seamless updates that happen behind the scenes (if enabled), a completely revamped notifications and settings menu that’s smarter, more detailed and enhanced. We also like the new round icons, space saver, and app icon shortcuts. Not to mention direct reply from notification bar for all apps, bunched notifications for a cleaner look, number blocking and call screening, improved Quick Setting tiles (and customization) and more. Meaning, there is a lot to see. We’ll be adding more to our list as we dig through each release. Many of these won’t be seen in the update on Samsung or Motorola phones though, as they slightly change the interface to their preference. Comparison You can click on any of the images below to instantly jump to that image in the slideshow and see how that part of the OS compares to previous versions. It’s worth noting the older Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow will always be on the left if needed. Android 7.0 Nougat or 7.1.1 is on the right or by itself. We’ll update with more details as they become available. Many of these changes are included on the Galaxy Nougat update, and others, but look different. Just keep that in mind as you explore the new software release. Enjoy all it has to offer, and drop us a comment below with any questions or concerns. Multi-window Support   1 / 27 With Android N Google has finally delivered multi-window support. Essentially allowing two apps to run on the screen simultaneously. This works on both tablets and smartphones, and appears to work across all apps. We saw this in Android M previews, but it never made it to the final version. However, in Android N this is a highlight feature that's getting a lot of attention. Multi-window support works by tapping the square recent apps menu, then sliding any app to the top. Instantly users can run two apps at once, resize each screen as they see fit, and better multi-task on Android. This will be a very welcomed edition for Android tablet users, app developers and more. Google also states this will allow "Picture-in-Picture" mode for Android TV, which is awesome. Being able to watch TV while browse Netflix at the same time.   1 / 27 25 Responses 03/10/2016 Angelatphoenix Reply Cool inonce…!m­­­­­­­­­y f­­­­­­­­­r­­­­­­­­­i­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­n­­­­­­­­­d’s s­­­­­­­­­t­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­p-s­­­­­­­­­i­­­­­­­­­s­­­­­­­­­t­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­r m­­­­­­­­­a­­­­­­­­­k­­­­­­­­­e­­­­­­­­­s $85 /h­­­­­­­­­r o­­­­­­­­­n t­­­­­­­­­he co­­­­­­­­­mpu­­­­­­­­­ter .

I think Google are running out of ideas and just simply moving the UI around mostly to try and ‘wow’ people. Perhaps they should spend time sorting out their app store to better suit tablets and large screens rather than just pumping out new android versions for the sake of it. 03/16/2016 Cory Gunther Reply Um…. what do you think split screen and improved multi-tasking is for.. tablets. It makes the experience so much better. I’m using Android N on the Pixel C and it’s actually very impressive. And if you saw other coverage, the multi-window mode is far more advanced than Samsung’s, and others. 08/22/2016 Gag Reply Smartphone OS changes come subtly.

Android 6 doesn’t let you move apps to the sd card…android 5 does. 05/02/2017 Bruce Wayne Reply Android 6 and 7, if not under the storage settings, still allows you to actually adopt the SD card as if it were internal. I’ve got a 200gb SanDisk micros adopted uind add commands via pc. It’s simple and doesn’t require root. A little research and you’d have found that out pretty quickly as a how to was released the day Marshmallow was pushed to Samsung phones. 05/12/2017 Phorne Reply Bruce Wayne, I’m confused! :-( I’m running Android 6 (Marshmallow) on LG Stylo 2 and it DOESN’T allow the SD Card as internal storage. I’ve just been on the phone with LG who had to explain to me why I had the option with my previous Stylo (Android 5) and not this one. I’m livid about that because I have a huge card and can’t use it for apps, only photos/media. What am I missing? Please tell me how it’s done. Thanks :-) 10/01/2016 that guy Reply Android N Data Saver, 6/20: “[…] we want it towards the end of the month, and has auto-on options as well. Say around the 34-35th of each month if user are getting close to running out of data.” What kind of calendar are you using? Somebody with the technology capable of reaching a planet (or alternate universe) with 35 days each month probably isn’t worried about maxing their data plan out. 10/24/2016 Smart Reply That’s nice post….

Pointless putting in the changes to minimise other apps background usage and then adding a feature that will automatically download a 2GB or more image in the background while roaming. 01/12/2017 Gift Reply “34th or 35th of each month”… Is that an intentional joke? 02/14/2017 Wolf Reply My favorite ones are the GIF keyboard support & the finger gestures, with all these additions it’s getting less necessary to rely on 3rd party apps.

It has changed everything in my Marshmallow I liked. I can’t arrange my favorites in my phone list. It used to be squares next to each other, now it is a long list that I hate. Also, my camera is different. I liked how it used to be with the bars at the bottom I could slide, now It is more inconvenient to use!! Boo!!! There are a few other details that I do not like. I can’t list all of them here. Wish I could go back to my Marshmallow and get rid of Nougat!!! Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Google's "Project Treble" will modularize Android to make updates faster Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/12 12:42pm PDTMay 12, 2017 57 Plus 1 on G+ 118 Share on Facebook 52 Share on Twitter Total Shares227 Android O Android OS Development Google News Easily the most annoying aspect of using an Android phone (with the exception of Pixel/Nexus) is slow updates. Android 7.1 (which came out last year) currently sits at 0.5% marketshare, and brand new phones are still being released with 6.0 Marshmallow. Google is aiming to solve this with "Project Treble," which will modularize part of the Android OS to decrease the time OEMs spend updating their devices. If you're not familiar with how Android updates work, here's a summary. Google releases a new Android version, which silicon manufacturers (e.g. Qualcomm, Mediatek) have to supply drivers for. Once that's done, device makers (e.g. Samsung, HTC) can start re-adding all the tweaks they have made to the new Android source code. In the case of carrier-sold phones/tablets, device makers then have to wait for the carriers to approve the update. After all that is done, users finally start to receive the update. Google is hoping to speed up this process with Project Treble, which changes the architecture of Android. Essentially, a new 'Vendor interface' will contain all of the low-level software for a device - like the chipset drivers. Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS). The aspect of this news I'm most excited about is that the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible. There have been many cases where chipset manufacturers have not updated drivers for specific popular chips, preventing devices using them from being officially updated to newer Android versions. One example is the Nexus 5 and other Snapdragon 800/801-based devices, which were never officially updated to 7.0 Nougat. It sounds like the Vendor interface will prevent this from happening, or at least prolong the end of support for a given chip. Google says that Android O will be the first version to use the new Vendor interface, and the Android O Developer Preview already has it. Hopefully we'll hear more about Project Treble at Google I/O next week. Source: Android Developers Tags Android android o project treble treble vendor interface vendor test suite vts subscribe ...

PI there are quirks ,,, its not easy for highly customizable rom ,, OEM will stil rant about it and the only thing we will do rant about them ,,,and that's what we r doing for all those years,,OEM don't give a dam shadowx360 Sounds like a stopgap till they can get Fuschia running with their own kernel. Hopefully this means Google can update more core system functions similar to Google Play Services independent of the OEM/carrier path. Mike Updates still have to go through carriers, this just helps prevent devices from early EoL and should make OEMs jobs easier by not having to rewrite every piece of code to work with new drivers. TechGuy22 that's why this is useless. carriers are still involve and OEM like samsung takes time with their own skin destinyhud thats why i buy pixel. also, like mentioned this will reduce the amount of modification needed in android's new version which means slightly early release. even if its 2 weeks early i am good wit it TechGuy22 or or you can push google to make things easier for carriers and OEMs and not bandages i have an S7 edge and a pixel xl. go figure Taco Monster You can't make things easy for someone who doesn't want to do said things. bekifft It's why I buy Pixel too but the whole point of Android was supposed to be freedom and choice. If my only real choices are Google or Apple, I might as well buy a damn iPhone. PI This Daniel Not necessarily. All the OEM has to do is bring their crap (skin) from the last android version. Of course that probably only happen with small android updates (8.1?) Zsolt V Why shouldn't they? By all accounts, they add value so it's worth the wait. CA-Sandra Fuchsia is a very long term project. It's not going to replace Android anytime soon. Dextro I've been saying for ages that Android needs an hardware abstraction in the vein of what Windows has in its driver model. Hopefully this is it and helps get those updates out faster. Sadly I expect that the endless stream of UI customization OEM make will end up killing any kind of benefit this brings. Corbin Davenport I want something like that too, but I'm not deeply familiar with the technical structure of Linux/Android, so I would assume sure there some massive limitation that is keeping that from happening. Dextro I think (but am now 100% sure on this so don't quote me) that Linux historically hasn't had any such abstraction. Drivers are meant to be inside the kernel and compiled for each specific version. That works fine if the code is open source and committed to the kernel repos but it becomes a nightmare for binary blobs. The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. That's probably part of the reason why Android has failed to keep up with Linux kernel versions. keithzg The kernel makes no allowances for stable driver APIs, they will break stuff and won't worry for anything outside of the kernel if I remember correctly. I wouldn't really say this is true. In fact, there is a very stable API provided by the Linux kernel. Hell, one of the most famous Linus rants was about this very topic: It's a bug alright - in the kernel. How long have you been a maintainer? And you *still* haven't learnt the first rule of kernel maintenance? If a change results in user programs breaking, it's a bug in the kernel. We never EVER blame the user programs. How hard can this be to understand? WE DO NOT BREAK USERSPACE! https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/23/75 Obviously drivers are trickier, but they're still expected to continue working. The big catch comes in that ARM drivers tend to come as compiled binary blobs. There really isn't an allowance for that in the workflow of things for Linux; good citizens are supposed to provide source, and then new kernel versions and the drivers therefore (often within the kernel itself) are recompiled, and everyone's happy. But while the API remains the same, the ABI does not; drivers compiled as modules for an older kernel won't work on newer ones, even though the drivers would almost certainly work fine if they were recompiled. The ARM space is utterly lousy with proprietary drivers (in no small part this is Qualcomm's fault, although they're far from the only offender). Hence you have Google forever backporting kernel updates to older kernels, so that the ABI remains consistent and older device drivers continue working. Dextro Well, I stand corrected then. But one question then: I was under the impression that drivers were not in userspace but in kernelspace. That's why I didn't even think much of that famous Linus rant. keithzg True, they're (generally; FUSE, for instance, is an area of exception) in kernel space, and that rant isn't entirely applicable because of that, but for practical purposes that just means ABI changes break drivers. And the kernel devs do reserve the right to change the in-kernel API at any point, which could in theory break drivers---it's just that in practice they are rather worried about such breakage and don't wish to do so, and barely break it more than they do userspace. When you think about it, it'd kindof be an insane amount of maintenance if people had to update driver code for new kernel versions! Luckily for "desktop Linux", most drivers these days in the x86 space are open source (NVIDIA is remaining holdout, although even there you can fall back to the Nouveau drivers most of the time), so they're just baked into the kernel or provided as kernel modules, and in practice don't really have to be touched by human hands after they're originally written. Unluckily for Android, that is very much not true in the ARM hardware world. Hell, most Chinese OEMs will just flatly refuse to provide kernel source, even though they're legally obligated to do so. Gaurav Kumar Which is why fuchsia has a stable ABI...like windows. I agree it's not coming anytime soon but it may not be that far away as well.. Сергей Бугаев Android has the HAL https://source.android.com/devices/#Hardware-Abstraction-Layer -- but it haven't been helping much, as we can see (or would it be much worse without it?). It'd be interesting to see more technical details about Tremble to understand how it's different. Andy J https://developer.android.com/things/index.html pretty much this is what they are aiming for - from the days of Project Brillo. "System updates and support: We provide the system image, updates, fixes, and more, so you can focus on creating compelling products" Brillo/Things is the same idea - there is the low level vendor stuff, the actual OS and then the OEM stuff. Google can update the OS on running devices in the field, without worrying about the vendor stuff or the OEM stuff. Knowledgeborn Allah Exactly... And, unfortunately, this probably isn't going to be anything like Microsoft's new update process for Windows 10 Mobile, which doesn't have to go through carriers. Based on all the software modifications most Android OEMs make with their devices, this probably won't speed up OS updates at all. More powerful devices may last slightly longer, but that will still leave it to the OEMs to support those devices for longer periods, and they likely won't do that anyway, since they're constantly trying to get you to purchase the next one... Zsolt V Windows 10 what? bekifft I agree completely about the HAL, but the real problem remains the network operators retaining strict control over user devices. If AT&T doesn't want to spend the money to add AT&T Navigator, AT&T Device Locator, AT&T Messages, etc etc etc, they will simply not deploy the update. SomeGuy112 This is great, gives the potential for much longer OS update support, especially for Googles own hardware. Hopefully the OG Pixel gets longer than 2 year OS support because of this. destinyhud good point Dn Bro Didn't the article say the new devices with O will have this? DragoCubed The dev preview for the pixel has this project. We can assume it's staying with the pixel MrHanMan So, is it Trebble, or Treble? Jdban Treble according to the google docs Corbin Davenport It is Treble, I can't spell. Fixed. Jeff The trouble with Trebbles... destinyhud i really hope this fixes the 2 week delay in getting major update to nexus devices /s John Doe This is good but Google need to do more. They need to modularize everything in the Android update process. Create a separate carrier update so the baseband can be updated separate from the OS and same to drivers and also OEM skins/Apps. This should have FIVE different updates paths: 1) Core OS/Kernel update path 2) Driver update path 3) Baseband/Carrier related Apps update path 4) OEM Skin/Apps path 5) Security update path This way Google can control the Security, Core OS, Baseband, and Drivers by working with carriers and silicon manufacturers. Also if T-Mobile for example wants to push an update out for the baseband and messaging/phone apps they can do that independent of Google and OEMs. The same goes for Samsung and Qualcomm and others. Latheryin You are confused on one part. What you call skins are not what you think they are. All of the OEM versions of android are completely different distros that replace core OS files and frameworks with their versions. John Doe I know but If Google were to modularize it then it would just be a "skin" or "theme" that is separate from the framework/OS this will give Google control over the main OS and the only way to do that is to not allow OEMs to modify it too much. Latheryin Which would remove all the extra features that devices add on. Many have to be tied into the frameworks and other base OS drivers and libs. There is no separation in it really. And with the way they licensed Android they cant really control a whole lot. Any OEM could easily reverse anything Google does and still release it. John Doe Well yeah of course Google can't do that alone they would have to make new agreements with OEMs and carriers. Most OS skins do not have that many extra features and Google can create APIs to allow OEMs to modify anything they want like if Samsung wants to add an Iris scanner as a password or whatever. The point is OEM "skins" need to become more like launchers in the play store like Nova and Apex and If OEMs want to modify something they would have to ask Google like how Microsoft treats windows. Latheryin You really dont have a great understanding of how things work. That will never hap=p=en. Maybe with Googles second mobile OS they might try to have more control. John Doe How about instead of being an arrogant prick, you tell me what I said is incorrect or what Google cannot do? Why do you think this cannot happen? Microsoft did this with Windows mobile. Like I said, Google would have to sign new licensing agreements with OEMs and Carriers but they probably have to revise it for this Project Treble anyways. Google already uses its Apps and Play store as a bargaining chip to update those agreements. Latheryin Ok first. Google would have to change the license under which android is licensed. Which can't be done. Also have you ever ripped Android apart and had a look? I would guess not as if you had we would not be talking about this. As for what we does does. That really is apples and oranges. Not even close e same thing. The apps and play store are not really that big of a deal. There are hundreds of android devices released every year that don't include them and they sell really well. John Doe You said NOTHING I have not said already. Why Google cannot change the Android license? What stops Google from implementing this since you are the Genius that ripped Android apart and decided this cannot be done? Google already has MADAs in place and they update them every few years with OEMs. Those devices are mostly in China since Google services are banned there. If the Play store is not a big deal then Samsung would have forked Android a long time ago. But go ahead I am still waiting for your "intelligent" replies. Even Amazon's fire phone failed miserably without the play store and Google apps. Latheryin Have you even read the license? Do you really have any idea what happens when something is licensed? Doesn't take that much really. Anyone can look at the code. Heck some of the best android developers are teens. Samsung already did. It's called tizen. Also Samsung is not the end all of devices. They even have a separate store for the devices they run with Android. All Samsung apps don't even hit the Play store. They are Android devices for the common man. Made for everyday people. Ask your favorite developer what device he runs. Look if you want to know more why not dig in, instead of trying to get into a tech conversation when you don't really know too much about it. John Doe Licenses can be updated and their MADAs can be updated which they already do. Samsung did not fork Android, they created a different OS. And that is not turning out very well for them. You still have not told me how what I said cannot be implemented. You should go get one of those Teen Android developers to help you out before you just turn down ideas that you have know nothing about. If Google wanted to they can change Android to how Windows does updates there is nothing stopping them from doing that and OEMs will not fork Android if they did that. I love how you just criticize arguments without providing valid reasons instead of just saying Android does not allow you to do that provide factual reasons or STFU. klaus666 Could this also help to port LineageOS to a smartphone once LineageOS is adapted to this new modular system? jgarrido I dunno, sounds like treble to me... JD OK I get that Google is essentially making what in the Windows World is the HAL and breaking that out of the Kernel and they're essentially creating a lower level API (For lack of a better term) to segment off Android from the OEM mods. However what is actually stopping the OEMs from sayin' fuck this ain't working out let me go in there and refork it anyway. I mean API's are there, now and OEMs should be using that to interact with Android but Android is coming up short so they fork it and custom build the ROM with their own customization and branches. For the longest time the camera stack was a HUGE reason for doing this, even now the Camera2 API is still coming up short, which is why Samsung Completely branches on their own for that too. freshprince_87 Google simply needs to make it mandatory for carriers /OEMS to update their devices and release new phones in the most current version of Android Adnoxaei They could make it a requirement for access to the Play store. Without this interface, that would have been very restrictive. With this interface, customizations can still easily exist, so companies may be more willing to cooperate...espevially if it cuts down on the time needed to test and deploy updates boop By the sound of it, the Vendor Interface is for SoC manufacturers, not device makers. jcopernicus Sweet! Can't wait for my Z3 Compact to get this update! NubCake This doesn't sound like a treble idea at all, hopefully it helps the slow updating process. Knowledgeborn Allah I see what you did there... 🙄😂 ddevito No bass.... Tom Westrick But what if a user is all about that bass? Killa Then they might be in treble if that's all they are about. Sorry, couldn't help myself. :P Emergency Medical Hologram Bassed on what? Martheen Cahya Paulo There's plenty of tweeter surrounding it. Dolby so if we consider the stereo type. Testraindrop While this is certainly a step in the right direction, I somehow doubt that this will change Googles attitude to abandon their own devices after 2 years. Its not like the SOC in the Nexus 5 stopped working when N was installed, in fact its working fine, developed by independent individuals without having "to work with chipset manufacturers", which Google apparently couldn't even achieve. Also the times where google stops updates for the N6 and the Pixels is already set, so even with a chipset blob that is "forwards-compatible" there wont be any further (official) updates. Also if those Vendor APIs will have limits to certain OS aspects like camera, sound etc., then manufacturers will not use them and will just fork again the OS as done currently. saf1927 The custom ROMs that work on Nexus 5 devices don't actually benefit from a lot of things that an officially supported device would. Qualcomm has completely abandoned the chip so from a retail perspective, it's not suitable anymore. Even the "security updates" that these ROMs show in "About phone" aren't actually all implemented, since none of the proprietary blobs and binaries could be updated. Just because a device can be updated with a custom ROM, doesn't mean it's actually running it well. someone755 "Just because it's running it well doesn't mean it's running it well." Welp. AbdulB1 Mediatek and in some cases​ Qualcomm (for Nexus 5,sd800,801) don't want people to stay on old phones they try to force them to buy new phones for latest Android version. I am not sure will they be happy about this change? I suspect they will flood market with phones running Android nougat instead. They will try to resist this change by Google. saf1927 Mediatek and Qualcomm aren't device makers, they are silicon manufacturers. AbdulB1 Mediatek charges device makers for new drivers for latest Android versions. Qualcomm stopped supporting sd 800/801 for Android Nougat and thus even sony a device maker who was developing Android N developer versions for a SD800/801 stopped. Chipset makers also have huge clout , it not just sensor makers who decide to support or not their older hardware for newer Android release. saf1927 Well, my point is that none of the silicon manufacturers will force anyone to make only Nougat phones, like you claimed. AbdulB1 "Google will work with chipset manufacturers to make sure the Vendor interface is forwards-compatible, and the interface will be validated by a Vendor Test Suite (VTS)." so if Vendor dont get validated for VTS then do you expect any chances of Android O for those devices? dizel123 I suspect if OEMs want to release new phones with the latest OS version because that's what their users want(I know I'm making assumptions) and Mediatek and Qualcomm try to force them to release phones with Nougat, then Intel will suddenly become a dominant player in the mobile market. This would be exactly the kind of "in" they're praying for. AbdulB1 Intel architecture is quite old , I owned 2 Intel based Android tablets. Intel even didn't bothered to upgrade the OS from 4.0.4 and other one had 5.0 as latest release even it though it was buggy as hell and every hardware vendor went for 5.1 instead. Intel had an edge of running windows along android on their cpu tech. But lack of proper built in modem destroyed their chances in Android world. Their SOCs still had quite high consumption even after releasing newer and newer generations of Mobile SOCs. dizel123 I don't have any inside information, but I'm guessing Intel is working on fixing their problems and making high quality SOCs Cakefish Intel dropped out of the mobile SOC wars. It cancelled development of all upcoming chips last year, I believe. dizel123 Their announcement at this year's Mobile World Congress as well as their current road map on their website both indicate that they're still developing mobile SOCs Lateef Alabi-Oki Jesus! What took them so long? pfmiller I believe there are performance costs to adding hardware abstraction. Google may feel that mobile hardware is finally at a point where it's worth the cost. AbdulB1 Will it help in churning out custom ROMs? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I actually want the vendors to work on Android itself, not just their layer. They fix a lot of the bugs that Google leaves in. saf1927 They are already working on that: "In addition to the architectural changes, we're working with our silicon and device partners to take their code changes, such as features for a carrier network in a specific country, and move them into the common Android Open Source Project (AOSP) codebase. For example, Sony and Qualcomm contributed dozens of features and hundreds of bugfixes to Android O so they no longer need to rework these patches with each new release of Android." Simply put, some vendors contribute more than others. Sony is a great example in that regard. They contribute a lot. dizel123 This might just be the best thing Google has ever done to Android Eddie Ringle If you want to see more technical details, here's a bit of what I found back in March when the Developer Preview was released: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13928385 SHunter Orrrrr.... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7b191be55920725d6f6aba09c97c1e1942bdfb290cb4cf53e2cb9e23c706626c.png Eumelanin Knight Better late than never. Let's hope Carriers and Manufactures don't have their way and muck this up some how. bekifft At least they're being up front about the problem finally and making it an official "project." It seems like every year the promise is "we're fixing battery this time" and "we're fixing updates." Every year. Never gets better. And with the current FCC and the network operators only set to get worse about their abusive practices, I don't hold out much hope for this plan. What it boils down to is if there is any possible way for network operators (carriers) to meddle with the update, they will. This practice truly aught to be illegal, but see above. Maybe this will at least help lazy to the point of negligence OEMs (Lenovo) not be so appallingly slow. Islam sounds like a joke to me. John C.S. Lock When you finally giving up on Android after 10 long years , here we come iOS ! charfarstar I'll believe when Pixel 2 comes with 4 years of OS updates. MeCampbell30 Turn the treble up in my headphones. Régis Knechtel OMG!

But hey, at least you'll get more frequent updates so that it can get slower more often! xyz People have been telling Google to use their muscle with the chipset makers forever. Qualcomm didn't release drivers is not an acceptable reason to not update Android. Sir_Brizz Hardware manufacturer doesn't release drivers is a perfectly acceptable reason not to update. Consumers should level their hatred at the right target. Blaming Samsung, for example, for Qualcomm's shortcoming won't change Qualcomm's policies. Andy J So last year it was A/B updates from Project Brillo and this year it's the ability to update the OS independently from the low level chipset drivers and the OEM stuff - which is also something Google developed for Project Brillo. While there are no actual Project Brillo / Android Things products in the market yet - it was definitely a worthwhile project for them with these rewards. (Yes I'm aware Chromebooks had A/B updates - but from everything I have heard, they still came about because of Project Brillo, even if Project Brillo wasn't an actual thing when they found their way to Chromebooks) kelpa32 it take google untill android O to try to get updates on time.

By Lucian Constantin Romania Correspondent, IDG News Service | May 12, 2017 12:39 PM PT Credit: Trend Micro More like this Google Docs phishing attack underscores OAuth security risks Here's how the sneaky Gmail phishing attack fooled victims with a fake Google... Google might be gearing up to remove millions of Play Store apps next month Video Why You Lost Your Windows 10 Product Key In response to recent attacks where hackers abused Google's OAuth services to gain access to Gmail accounts, the company will review new web applications that request Google users' data. To better enforce its policy regarding access to user data through its APIs (application programming interfaces), which states that apps should not mislead users when presenting themselves and their intentions, Google is making changes to the third-party app publishing process, its risk assessment systems and the consent page it displays to users. Google is an identity provider, which means other web apps can use Google as the authentication mechanism for users accessing the app. Apps use the OAuth protocol to do this. These apps can also use Google's APIs to send users requests for information stored in Google's services. [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] Last week, a large number of users received a well-crafted phishing email that asked them to view a document in Google Docs. Clicking on the link redirected them to a Google OAuth consent page that said an application called Google Docs wanted access to their contacts and Gmail accounts. The reason this spoofing attack worked is that there was no mechanism to prevent a third-party app registered to Google's OAuth service from using the same name as one of Google's own apps -- or the name of another legitimate third-party app. Since the attack, Google has strengthened its risk assessment for new apps and made other changes to better detect such abuse. So app developers might see error messages when registering new applications or modifying existing ones in the Google API Console, Firebase Console, or Apps Script editor, the Google Identity Team said in a blog post. On top of this, based on the results of the enhanced risk assessment, some web applications will need to undergo a manual review and approval process that could take from three to seven business days. "Until the review is complete, users will not be able to approve the data permissions, and we will display an error message instead of the permissions consent page," the Google identity team said. For now, developers will only be able to request a review during the application testing phase, but in the future, Google will also allow review requests during the registration phase. Until the app is reviewed, developers will be able to continue testing their app using their own account, as well as to add additional testers.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Maps rolls out integrated Street View images in turn-by-turn directions Newsby John Callaham11 hours ago 2 246 14 Google Maps offers turn-by-turn directions for getting you exactly where you want to go. However, sometimes those directions can be hard to figure out if a location for a turn has a more complex intersection. Now, a new server-side update for the Android version adds a feature made to fix this problem; Street View pictures that have been integrated in those turn-by-turn directions. See also: How to use your Google Maps offline March 21, 2017 This feature was first spotted by Android Police, and TechCrunch has since confirmed it is available worldwide for all Android Google Maps users.  Now, when you view the turn-by-turn directions in the app, you should see that many of the intersections and directions now have a thumbnail Street View image of that location displayed on the right. Tapping on a thumbnail will then show you the full 360 degree image, which should show you exactly where you need to turn. Google Maps actually added this feature to the web version way back in 2008. It’s unknown why it took so long to include this small but highly useful addition to the Android app. There’s no word yet when it might be added to the iOS version. Android Police also notes that some users have spotted a new bottom bar with more info and directions buttons for a location, but adds this might be just an experiment that’s being tested.

Photos Videos Topics Live WI 218/5 (100) - PAK 376/10 (146.3) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kapil Mishra Emmanuel Macron Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Bahubali 2 News Business News COLUMN-Judge in Waymo trade secrets case calls out Uber counsel: Frankel Shares1 Sat, 13 May 2017-12:49am , Reuters Uber's legal strategy to ward off a trade secrets suit by Waymo backfired spectacularly on Thursday night. U.S. District Judge William Alsup of San Francisco denied Uber's motion to send the Alphabet subsidiary's case to arbitration. But that's not all. The judge also referred Waymo's claims that Uber misappropriated its self-driving technology to the U.S. Attorney's office, based on an evidentiary record the judge (uncharacteristically) kept under seal, and partially granted Waymo's bid for a preliminary injunction to stop Uber from using its tech. That order is not publicly available, and Judge Alsup styled it as a grant of provisional relief rather than an injunction. But assuming that he applied the exacting likelihood-of-success standard to Waymo's evidence that Uber misappropriated trade secrets, Thursday night's rulings mean Uber is now stuck litigating in front of a judge who thinks Waymo has a quite convincing case. And what's more, Judge Alsup's 10-page decision to keep the Waymo suit out of arbitration contains hints that the judge is skeptical of tactics used by Uber's lawyers at Morrison & Foerster and Boies Schiller Flexner. The judge's squeamishness about Uber's litigation gamesmanship is nowhere near the top of the company's long list of legal problems, which already includes a criminal investigation of its alleged use of software to help drivers evade transportation regulators as well as this case and class actions by drivers and passengers. But the Waymo suit isn't the first time Uber's aggressive litigation style has played badly with a federal judge. So as Uber and Waymo battle over what will doubtless be one of the most important technological developments of the next decade, it's worth taking a look at how the company ticked off the judge presiding over the fight. The most obvious clue comes from the last substantive paragraph in Judge Alsup's opinion. As the judge explained, the theme of Uber's motion to send this case to arbitration was an assertion that Waymo and its lawyers at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan were using litigation trickery to keep their suit in the public forum of federal court instead. Waymo's claims centered on technology allegedly stolen by a Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who was the longtime head of Google's self-driving tech team. (Levandowski left Google to start up a self-driving truck company that was later acquired by Uber.) Levandowski had signed two Google employment agreements requiring arbitration of any disputes he had with the company. According to Uber, those arbitration agreements should have compelled Waymo to arbitrate its trade secrets case against Uber – but Waymo deliberately omitted naming Levandowski as a defendant in the suit in order to keep the case in federal court. "UNWARRANTED" ACCUSATIONS As Judge Alsup recounted in Thursday's opinion, Uber alleged that Waymo used "'artful' or 'tactical' pleading to evade its arbitration obligations." Those words aren't necessarily derogatory and might even be considered lawyerly compliments. But Judge Alsup read them as implicit accusations – and found them to be "unwarranted." Waymo, according to the judge, had behaved with propriety. The company had, in fact, honored its arbitration agreement with Levandowski by bringing arbitration claims against its former employee. Its decision to assert a separate case against Uber in federal court "was not only reasonable but also the only course available, since Waymo had no arbitration agreement" with Uber, said Alsup, who elsewhere in the opinion said Waymo had "dutifully" gone to arbitration against Levandowski. By contrast, the judge said Uber lawyers had behaved "unfairly" when they cited supporting precedent for the first time in a reply brief. Judge Alsup also wasn't happy with Uber's too-clever-by-half explanation for why the leading California case on arbitration and equitable estoppel – which, as Alsup concluded, was not necessarily good precedent for Uber – did not mention a San Jose federal court decision that Uber considered great support for its argument to compel arbitration. Uber's lawyers, according to Judge Alsup, said in a footnote that the California decision did not contradict "the holding and rationale" of the federal-court opinion. What they didn't say, according to the judge, was that the California case could not have discussed the federal finding because the federal case wasn't decided until about two weeks after the state opinion. These are subtle criticisms, to be sure, but in combination with the judge's pointed defense of Waymo's pleadings, they're not a good portent for Uber. In a high-stakes case like this one, you just don't want the judge to think your side is unfair and sneaky and the other side is dutiful and honorable. In a statement responding to a detailed email request for comment, an Uber spokesperson said, "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum."

Fearless Muckraking Since 1993 Home Articles Recent Articles Magazine Current Issue Back Issues Subscribe Subscriber Access Subscribe Donate Archives Search Authors About JOIN LIST Books T-shirts podcasts FAQs May 12, 2017 The Cloud Panopticon: Google, Cloud Computing and the Surveillance-Industrial-Complex by Christopher Ketcham – Travis Kelly by Tweet Email In June 2007, Privacy International, a U.K.-based privacy rights watchdog, cited Google as the worst privacy offender among 23 online companies, ranking the “Don’t Be Evil” people below Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, eBay, LinkedIn, Facebook and AOL. According to the report, no other company was “coming close to achieving [Google’s] status as an endemic threat to privacy.” What most disturbed the authors was Google’s “increasing ability to deep-drill into the minutiae of a user’s life and lifestyle choices.” The result: “the most onerous privacy environment on the Internet.” Indeed, Google now controls an estimated 70 per cent of the online search engine market, but its deep-drilling of user information – where we surf, whom we e-mail, what blogs we post, what pictures we share, what maps we look at, what news we read – extends far beyond the search feature to encompass the kind of “total information awareness” that privacy activists feared at the hands of the Bush Jr. administration’s much-maligned Total Information Awareness program. Kevin Bankston, a privacy expert and attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group engaged in questions of privacy, free speech, and intellectual property in the digital age, warns of the possibilities. “In all of human history,” he says, “few if any single entities, other than the National Security Agency, have ever possessed such a hoard of sensitive data about so many people.” This is the sort of thing that should make the intelligence agencies, says Bankston, “drool with anticipation.” And drooling they are. Stephen Arnold, an IT expert who formerly worked at the defense and intelligence contractor Booz Allen Hamilton Inc. and who once consulted for Google, addressed this in a speech before a conference of current and former intelligence officials in Washington, D.C., in January 2006. According to an audio recording in our possession, he reported Google was increasingly sought out by the U.S. intelligence services because click-stream data – and everything else Google archives – “is a tremendous opportunity for the intelligence community.” Google, he said, “has figured out everything there is to know about data-collection.” The relationship with the government had become intimate enough, Arnold said, that at least three officers from “an unnamed intelligence agency” had been posted at Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. What they are doing there, Arnold did not reveal. “We don’t comment on rumor or speculation,” said Google spokesperson Christine Chen. When asked separately how many former intelligence agency officials work at Google, she responded, “We don’t release personnel information.” The conference, under the aegis of the Open Source Solutions Network, was hosted and organized by Robert David Steele, a former Central Intelligence Agency officer who left the agency 20 years ago and is now the founder and CEO of Open Source Solutions Network Inc., otherwise known as OSS.Net, an educational corporation that has worked with more than 50 governments to “advance the use of open source intelligence.” Steele considered Arnold’s item to be a bombshell. U.S. intel was now seated in the heart of the “Googleplex,” learning all it could from the masters in the private sector. Among Google’s critics, Steele who, since leaving the CIA, has spent 20 years promoting the digital commons, is about as fierce as they come. “Google would have been an absolutely precious gift to humanity,” he says. “But Google is positioning itself to take over the digital commons. I personally have resolved that unless Google comes clean with the public, the company is now evil.” The question today is whether Google, in fact, will be forced to change its ways – and whether Congress and the intelligence agencies want it to. Google’s powers of data-collection depend on consumer choice – how much of your computing you put in Google’s hands. The more you choose Google applications, the more Google can know about you. At the extreme end of the spectrum, your every move can be tracked by some feature of Google. When you use the Google search box, as tens of millions of people do daily (with Google handling roughly 11,000 searches per second), the company can track all your search queries and the websites you visit as a result of those queries. If you use Google toolbar, the company can watch the amount of time you surf a website – the three minutes or three hours you spend on every page of that website. With Google’s acquisition of YouTube in 2006, viewing habits can be tracked. Google’s FriendConnect and Orkut archive your social networks. Google News, Books, Feedburner or Blogger log your reading habits. The writing you produce is stored on Google Docs, and your purchase habits and credit card numbers are captured by Google Checkout. Also gathered are voiceprint and call habits, through Google Voice; travel interests, patterns and place associations, through Google Maps, Google Earth and Google StreetView; medical conditions, medical history and prescription drug use, through Google Health; photos of friends and family, through Google’s Picassa images; and general activities, through Google Calendar. Then, there’s Google Desktop, which, at one point, offered what appeared to be an innocuous feature called “Search Across Computers.” This allowed Google to scan your computer to archive copies of text documents. In other words, just about everything on your PC – love letters, tax returns, business records, bad poetry – was duplicated on a remote Google server. (This function was discontinued on all platforms in January of this year.) Taken alone, the Google search box is an exquisitely intimate repository of user information. “People treat the search box like their most trusted advisors,” says Kevin Bankston, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) attorney. “They tell the Google search box what they wouldn’t tell their own mother, spouse, shrink or priest.” Think about your most recent queries, say, about your “anal warts” or “inability to love in marriage,” or “self-hatred,” or your interest in the mechanics of “making a pipe bomb.” The search box is as good a place as any to understand how the Googleplex keeps tabs on its users. When you do a search, “cookies” installed on your computer record your IP address (a series of unique numbers that may be used to identify your computer), so Google can, in many contexts, identify a user. And it can do so with any of its applications. All this, one would think, ceases once your PC is shut down and you leave home. However, Google released a “geo-location” application in 2008, Gears Geolocation API, that can “obtain the user’s current position,” “watch the user’s position as it changes over time,” and “quickly and cheaply obtain the user’s last known position.” According to a Google tech blog, the Gears application “can determine your location using nearby cell-towers or GPS for your mobile device or your computer’s IP address for your laptop.” A 2006 Technology Review article reports that Google’s director of research, Peter Norvig, even proposed the use of built-in microphones on PCs to identify television shows playing in the room, in order to display related advertising. Such data, it seems, could be processed as an audio fingerprint, which might aid in geolocation and profiling of users. (“Google had no plans to develop this,” Google spokesperson Christine Chen responded by e-mail. “And we haven’t.”) Google’s data-mining interests go even deeper, to the core of our physical and mental being. Google co-founder Sergey Brin and his biotech specialist wife, Anne Wojcicki, according to The Economist, have “brainstormed” with at least one prominent human genome researcher and approach genetics as a “database and computing problem.” This would tie in nicely with Google Health, launched in 2008 to take advantage of the growing trend of storing health records online, for easier access among diverse health care providers. Google has invested $3.9 million in Wojcicki’s biotech firm, 23andMe, whose “mission is to be the world’s trusted source of personal genetic information,” and which offers a basket of genetic tests to allow its customers to uncover ancestry, disease risks, and drug responses. Speaking before a Google “Zeitgeist” conference in 2008, Brin revealed that he carried a Parkinson’s gene and then advocated the recording of individual genetic codes to enhance health maintenance and medical research. Taken to its logical conclusion, this suggests the prospect of your body’s blueprint registered with an eventual “Google Genome,” perhaps with the help of the databases gathered at 23andMe. To drill further into the mind, Google has teamed up with marketing giant WPP to fund $4.6 million for research into online advertising, including one grant in the emerging field of “neuromarketing”: tracking everything from online navigation behavior to biofeedback metrics like heart rate, eye movement and brain wave activity in response to advertising stimuli. Google’s Chen points out that the results of this research will be available to industry as a whole and that “Google has no special right over, nor plans to use, any of the research funded by these grants.” From Google’s standpoint, marketing – not surveillance – is the purpose of the informational harvest, as advertising generates most of Google’s $23 billion in annual revenue. The company is driving the evolution of the behavioral advertising model: more personal information gathered on consumers means more effectively targeted ads, thus higher ad rates and profits. (Gmail users often note how advertising, directly related to the subject matter of recently sent mails or searches, pops up on their browsers.) The unsurprising offshoot of the behavioral advertising model is political advertising, a new market being pursued by Google’s Elections and Issue Advocacy Team in Washington, D.C. Campaigning online has become as important as dominating the broadcast networks for candidates and advocacy groups, and this will require broader profiling of political behavior – an area of compelling interest for the intelligence agencies. EFF attorney Bankston had his own personal run-in with the company in 2007. He was walking outside his office on 19th Street in San Francisco, when one of Google’s StreetView photography crews – who gather surreptitious pictures of practically every street in the world – caught him smoking a cigarette. Wired magazine editor Kevin Poulsen tracked down Bankston at a Silicon Alley party, and pulled out his laptop. “Take a look at this,” said Poulsen. Bankston was not pleased. “At the time,” he says, “I had represented to my family and other people that I had cut down on my smoking and even stopped smoking.” When Bankston emailed Google requesting to have his face blurred, the spokesperson from the legal department told him he needed to fax in his driver’s license and a sworn statement to prove his identity. “I had to give up my privacy,” says Bankston, “to protect my privacy.” Finally, after a week of prodding – and a pair of articles in Wired – Google removed the photos that showed Bankston puffing away on 19th Street. In the summer of 2008, Google instituted face-blurring for all its StreetView shots. But what most concerned Bankston as a privacy lawyer was that he had no clear legal protections against Google. “In legal terms, Google is in the Wild West,” says Bankston. “The law hasn’t kept up.” The reason for the lag is due to the revolution in how Google stores information. Google has developed into a software provider rivaling Microsoft, with this major distinction: almost all Google software is server-side, residing on massive Google computer banks, not your local PC, which means they own the content, not you. This is the paradigm shift of “cloud computing,” and the atmospheric analogy is apt. Information evaporates from your desktop or laptop and condenses in the “cloud,” held there for whenever and wherever the user wants it to rain down. For the customer, the advantages over desktop computing are appealing. You get software that is mostly free or relatively cheap; automatic upgrades; data backed up on redundant remote servers, thus crash proof (unless, of course, Google crashes); accessibility from any computer or wireless device; and there’s less strain on your desktop or laptop as most of the computation is handled by remote processors and data drives. Greasing the transition to the cloud, a new wave of inexpensive hardware – compact Netbooks specifically designed to configure with the cloud – is capturing a growing share of the PC market. Most ship with Windows, but, in a direct challenge to Microsoft, Google has announced the development of its own operating system, Chrome, to work more efficiently with its Chrome browser, both optimized for connecting online. But one of the big problems with the cloud, and the danger it presents, is that the Fourth Amendment’s protections against search and seizure do not apply. The caveats are buried deep in the text that users usually skip over, and click “I agree,” to install a new application. But the consequences are huge, says Bankston. “When private data is held by a third party like Google, the Supreme Court has ruled that you ‘assume the risk’ of disclosure of that data.” When you store e-mail at Gmail – or, similarly, in the cloud at Yahoo or Hotmail – “you lose your constitutional protections immediately.” To search and seize the information on your desktop, a law enforcement or intelligence agency requires a warrant or grand jury subpoena, after demonstrating probable cause before a judge or magistrate; or an order from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (authorized by FISA); or a National Security Letter issued by the FBI, Department of Defense or CIA. But to obtain that same information stored on Google’s servers, there is a shortcut: Google, like a telecom provider, may supply the information voluntarily as long as the government can argue the information is needed as part of an “emergency.” “Your data is less legally protected in the cloud,” says Bankston. “That’s a big issue when you have companies like Google that are soliciting more and more data into the cloud.” Take, for example, those records cached at Google Health: The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act protects the privacy of medical records stored with health care providers and insurance companies – but the law does not apply to the privacy of those records stored with third parties. Or, take Bankston’s smoking episode: Bankston had no recourse against public exposure. Google removed the photos simply as a sop to an outspoken privacy activist who made an outcry in the media. As for search queries, we have no idea how the law applies. Presumably, the stipulations of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 would come into play. The ECPA mandates different standards for privacy of information stored with a third party, depending on how old the information is. “But this has never been litigated,” says Bankston. “I think it’s very important for Congress to amend this 23-year-old law, so that’s it clear how it applies. To the extent that the law is uncertain, it benefits the government.” Certainly, the government has a variety of means for getting at Google’s data, but, again, this is shrouded in the unknown: the processing of national security letters, for example, is entirely conducted in secret, with gag orders on all parties involved. In other words, the determinant of your privacy is what Google and the government decide behind closed doors. “The threat is real that the government is accessing more Google information than it should,” says Bankston. The company’s privacy policy is not exactly reassuring: “In some cases, we may process personal information on behalf of and according to the instructions of a third party, such as our advertising partners … We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our services.” Google’s links with the intelligence agency may stretch back to 2004. In 1999, the CIA founded an IT venture capital firm called In-Q-Tel to research and invest in new digital technologies focused on intelligence gathering. An In-Q-Tel-funded company, Keyhole, Inc., developed the satellite mapping technology that would be acquired in 2004 to become Google Earth. In-Q-Tel’s former director of technology assessment, Rob Painter, joined Google as a senior manager of Google Federal, his focus the “evangelizing and implementing [of] Google Enterprise solutions for a host of users across the Intelligence and Defense Communities.” In turn, Google has sold versions of its technology, especially Google Earth, to many U.S. agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard, National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the state of Alabama, and Washington, D.C. For the CIA, Google provided servers to support Intellipedia, a Wikipedia-like intranet for sharing intelligence. For the NSA, it supplied four “search appliances” and a maintenance contract, according to a FOIA investigation by the San Francisco Chronicle in 2008. (When asked about whether Google had supplied any other products or services to the National Security Agency or other intelligence agencies, Google’s Christine Chen wrote by email, “We don’t comment on any discussions we may or may not have had with any national intelligence agency.”) According to Christopher Soghoian, a former CNet blogger and a doctoral candidate studying privacy and computing at the University of Indiana who has researched Google, the intelligence services would be particularly interested in Google’s “backdoor” programs for surveillance. Soghoian notes that Google applications launch without telling users that the processing and data storage is conducted on remote servers, as long as an Internet connection is maintained — easy enough, given the ubiquity of wireless broadband. Even with no connection, software such as Google’s Gears enable “offline” access to the cloud, running applications and storing data on a PC (again, no cost, no fuss) until a connection is re-established and the new data can be uploaded to Google. Thus the naive user transmits information to a third-party unwittingly – a modus operandi close to the definition of covert surveillance. Soghoian notes that Google likely receives thousands of subpoenas and warrants every year from government agencies demanding information (AOL gets approximately 1,000 requests a month related to civil and criminal cases), and it has hired former DOJ officials and U.S. intelligence officers as corporate legal compliance officers handling the traffic. “The government gets somebody on the other end of the line who’s from the intelligence or law enforcement community,” says Soghoian, “who knows how they work, and maybe is sympathetic to their cause. Google doesn’t put former ACLU lawyers in charge of its compliance team.” According to Google’s Chen, such numbers are not publicly available. “Obviously, we follow the law like any other company,” she says. “When we receive a subpoena or court order, we check to see if it meets both the letter and the spirit of the law before complying. And if it doesn’t, we can object or ask that the request is narrowed.” She points out that, in 2006, Google went to court to fight a Department of Justice subpoena for millions of search queries on the grounds that it invaded user privacy. The judge ruled in Google’s favor. Soghoian, however, suggests a perverse incentive for cooperation: by law, Google and the telecoms must be compensated for their time and effort. Thus, the feeding of information to spooks and cops can become a profitable enterprise. Google also works with some of the top players in the surveillance industry, notably Lockheed Martin and SRA International. SRA is listed as a Google “enterprise partner” – more than a hundred such partners are listed on the Google website. Both companies, Lockheed and SRA, have engineered and sold data-mining software to the intelligence agencies. SRA’s NetOwl program, for example, has been described by a blogger at Pennsylvania State University, who watched the application in action at a corporate recruiter forum, as “searching all kinds of documents using Google for a certain person.” In response to our inquiries for further information on these programs and how they might have been developed in cooperation with Google, a Lockheed Martin spokesperson told us, “The work we do with Google is exclusively related to their Google Earth system.” SRA International’s vice president for public affairs, Sheila Blackwell, states, “We don’t discuss the specifics of our intelligence clients’ business.” Former CIA officer Robert Steele says that the CIA’s Office of Research and Development had, at one point, provided funding for Google. According to its literature, ORD has a charter to push beyond the state of the art, developing and applying technologies and equipment more advanced than anything commercially available, including communications, sensors, semi-conductors, high-speed computing, artificial intelligence, image recognition and database management. Steele says that Google’s liaison at the ORD is Dr. Rick Steinheiser, a counterterrorism data-mining expert and a long-time CIA analyst. (No CIA response about Steinheiser’s work was forthcoming.) Then, there are the intelligence officials allegedly working at Google’s Mountain View headquarters. When tech guru Stephen Arnold first revealed this information in the 2006 OSS conference. Anthony Kimery, a veteran intelligence reporter at Homeland Security Today, followed up with a report alleging a “secret relationship” between Google and U.S. intelligence. Google was “cooperat[ing] with U.S. intelligence agencies to provide national and homeland security-related user information from its vast databases,” with the intelligence agencies “working to ‘leverage Google’s [user] data monitoring’ capability as part of an effort to glean from this data information of ‘national security intelligence interest’ in the war on terror.” In other words, Google’s databases – or, some targeted portion – may have been dumped straight into the maw of U.S. intelligence agencies. Like the giants of the surveillance-industrial complex, Google has backed its federal sales force in Reston, Virginia, with a D.C. lobbying operation – spending $2.9 million on lobbying in 2009 – to make sure that privacy is not a priority in the Obama administration. It also works with several industry-supported interest groups: the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the Technology Policy Institute, and the Progress & Freedom Foundation, whose mission statement espouses “an appreciation for the positive impacts of technology with a classically conservative view of the proper role of government… Those opportunities can only be realized if governments resist the temptation to regulate, tax and control.” All these groups are funded by Google, along with a who’s-who of communications behemoths. Their mission: subvert any congressional legislation extending Fourth Amendment-style prohibitions to the data-mining private sector. Their argument, per the Technology Policy Institute: “More privacy … would mean less information, less valuable advertising, and thus fewer resources available for producing new low-priced services” – in other words, privacy is a threat to the economy. Google has also managed to install favorites in the White House. Andrew McLaughlin, formerly chief of Google’s Global Public Policy and Government Affairs division while also serving as assistant treasurer for Google’s NetPAC lobby, has been appointed as Obama’s deputy chief technology officer for Internet policy, despite protests from privacy advocates. Vivek Kundra, now posted as the Obama administration’s chief information officer at the Office of Management and Budget, formerly served as the chief technology officer for the city of Washington, D.C., where he ditched the use of Microsoft programs for municipal operations in favor of Google products. Concerns were heightened last spring by an administration initiative, proposed in Senate Bill 773, to grant the executive branch authority to disconnect and assume some measure of control over private networks in a declared “cybersecurity emergency.” That could be a quarantine operation to isolate and defeat a viral attack. It could also be an excuse for censorship of certain sites – or, for the cybersecurity agencies to data-mine where they have been hitherto forbidden. Google could be declared “critical infrastructure” in such an emergency, and its management temporarily assumed by federally certified “cybersecurity professionals,” as defined in S.773. It’s not wholly unfeasible that Google’s massive and much coveted behavioral profiles could then be fed into the NSA’s computers. And even without S.773, a long accumulation of executive orders over three decades has likely laid the groundwork for executive authority to take over critical communications networks in a “national emergency.” But long before such an emergency comes to pass, if ever, the government and the regiments of data-mining companies it contracts with are seeing eye to eye. The commercial surveillance complex and the security surveillance complex have many common interests and methods: the ad gurus’ neuromarketing research complemented by the intel agencies’ longstanding research into mind control, from the CIA’s MK-ULTRA to the NSA’s current “cognitive neuroscience research”; the profiling of political behavior for campaign advertising complemented by the DHS’s elastic definitions of dissidents and “potential terrorists.” Google is now anonymizing IP addresses from search logs after nine months, down from its previous eighteen-month retention policy. Company spokesperson Chen states, “We’re committed to using data both to improve our services and our security measures for our users and to protect their privacy, and we remain convinced that our current logs retention policy represents a responsible balance.” This is in contrast to Microsoft, which after six months throws out the search query data altogether. “Remember that totally anonymized search queries can be linked together to build an identity,” says Bankston. “Why does Google need to store our data perpetually? They’re very vague about it.” Indeed, Google could, without violating the law, reveal a lot more about how it cooperates with the intelligence agencies – how many requests for information it receives, from what government entities, how many it complies with. “They could talk about all this, but they don’t,” says Bankston. “Google may not care a lot about your privacy, but they care a whole helluva lot about your perception of your privacy. To remind people of the risk of government access to your data is anathema.” This article originally appeared in the April print edition of CounterPunch magazine.

Samsung has its latest out, LG just released its best phone ever, and Google I/O is next week! Huge things happening. Anyway, this past Monday, we asked you to shoot over questions for Volume 46 of the DL Q&A Sessions. As always, you didn’t disappoint, so here are our answers. You asked about the phones we are most looking forward to, if HTC’s rumored “Edge Sense” can impress us, if any OEM can compete against LG and Samsung’s design work, and if we’ll be copping a pair of the $500 Lonzo Ball shoes. Seriously, you asked some good ones. Let’s get to it.  Reminder: K is Kellen, T is Tim. What three phones are you most looking forward to for the rest of the year and why? K:  Gotta go with new Pixel, Note 8, and OnePlus 5. The previous Pixel, Note, and OnePlus phones were our favorites from last year, so I’m guessing they’ll all be really great again. But really, I’m most excited to see if Google will bring us a fresh design. I think we know what to expect in terms of design from the next Note and OnePlus 5, but Google can’t just go iPhone clone again, can they? T:  Galaxy Note 8, OnePlus 5, Pixel 2. Why? Well, I’m a big fan of the Note series, big fan of Google phones, and OnePlus impressed me with the OnePlus 3/3T. Do you think smartphones can still compete with a more traditional design (bezel, 16:9 aspect ratio), or have the G6 and Galaxy S8 already changed consumer expectations regarding what constitutes a modern smartphone form factor? K:  G6 and S8 have spoiled me, for sure. I look at regular phone designs and they just look old and dated now. Don’t get me wrong, the Pixel is still probably my favorite phone at the moment, but it looks flat-out embarrassing next to either of those other two phones. T:  Oh, absolutely. Design is surely important to potential buyers, but it’s not everything. I mean, the iPhone has looked the same for 10 years, so there must be something else going on. If an OEM can deliver a smooth experience, plus additional built-in features on top of Android, they could easily compete against Samsung and LG’s design work. Even Google doesn’t seem concerned about overall design too much, with the Pixels sporting more bezel than a lot of other devices. It’s the whole package that counts, not just the design itself. How do you feel about the “Sense Touch” features rumored for the HTC U 11? K:  I’m all for smartphone makers trying new stuff. So like how we got excited about modularity, I’m somewhat excited to see what HTC has to offer here in the squeezy department. Who knows, maybe it’ll be the next always-on display trend that we can’t get enough of. T:  I think it’s pretty cool, but I could see a few gimmicky things, too. As long as I can control notifications and Do Not Disturb, I’ll be pretty happy. On the OnePlus devices, there’s that slider, so I’m hoping HTC has something similar to that with the Sense Touch. What are your thoughts on this “Fuchsia” OS Google is developing? K: Part of me doesn’t care much at the moment. In its current form, it’s just a shell that doesn’t do anything except present itself in the most confusing manner ever. The other part of me obviously realizes this could be the future of mobile computing, assuming Google finishes it and decides it could one day replace Android. But man, we have a long way to go before any of that can happen. And I’m also the ultimate hype killer of all things like this. Maybe I’m just not nerdy enough to care about kernels and SDKs and that stuff. T:  If you were to rate my interest at this exact moment, it’d be about 2 out of 10. I do think Fuchsia could be the future, but we could be a long ways from ever seeing it come to fruition. Plus, with this being Google, I try not to focus heavily on projects that have yet to be detailed. They could be working on it, then drop it for an untold reason. There are more questions than answers for it, so right now, I’m just hanging back and keeping an eye on it. What are your most used apps right now? Not counting social media apps. K:  Was going to say, Twitter, but no social. Hmmm, I use Garmin’s Connect app a lot, since it tracks all my fitness needs. I’m in theScore constantly with NBA Playoff basketball going on and Champions League close to wrapping up. I’ve been on Untappd a lot in recent months to finally start logging beers too. I use a lot of smart home apps like Wink, Nest, and Hue all the time as well. T:  Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, YouTube, Dark Sky, Google Opinion Rewards, and Google Play Books. I’m reading Neil deGrasse Tyson’s latest, Astrophysics for People in a Hurry, which is totally awesome! What are your thoughts on the Lonzo Ball shoe? K:  Outside of the price being ridiculous, the shoe is pretty average looking. I know a lot of people want to compare it to Kobes of old, but I just see a knockoff that’ll probably be a terrible shoe to play in. Promo video of Lonzo walking around in it just seemed to show a shoe that isn’t going to be able to hold up under game stress. Good for the Balls for trying their own thing, though. I’m guessing it’ll fail pretty quickly, but at least they gave it a shot. T:  Throw ’em in the trash. Can the dumpster fire that is Android tablets be salvaged? K:  No. Apple isn’t even selling many iPads these days. People just don’t care about tablets. We have huge phones and computers already. What do you need a tablet for? They are big, awkward to hold, and only good for watching Netflix while on flights. T:  Unless I’m flying, I have no purpose for them. No one is selling them, at least in numbers that would impress, so maybe it’s time they die. Sure, there’s someone who will fight me over that, but whatever. Laptops > Tablets. With Samsung and LG pushing this 18:9 aspect ratio, and pretty much everyone having a good camera now, what do you see as the next big hardware differentiator? K:  I wish it was battery life, but I just don’t see anyone making a breakthrough there any time soon. That’s unfortunate too, because that is still the last remaining big change we need – phones that can last multiple days. I also wish – in terms of design – that companies would back away from the shiny, fingerprinty glass. Glass is pretty, but it’s fragile and annoying to clean all of the time. T:  I don’t think aspect ratio is something any average consumer is asking about when they purchase their phone. Sure, we on the Android blogs care, but does by mom or older brother care? Unlikely. Like you said, everyone has a good camera now, so it could be the battery that sets phones apart. Everyone loves long battery life. For me, though, if multiple phones check all of my boxes, it’d come down to in-hand feel. Do I want to look at it and hold it? Then that’s the one I’ll get. Check out our previous Q&A posts!

I still use mine plenty but I like it more than what’s come out since. If it broke, I wouldn’t think ‘sweet, now I can upgrade!’ Instead I’d think, ‘Damn, where am I going to find another original Tab S?’ hkklife All I ever wanted was a Tab S refresh with a faster SoC, Type-C, 64GB storage and a beefier battery. The S2 9.7 sure did not do it and the S3 9.7 is going int the opposite direction as an iPad Pro competitor. BobButtons Mine is primarily used for media consumption. Yeah, phones are getting bigger but 5.5″ is already on the large side IMO, don’t care to go any larger for a device I carry in my pocket all day and an 8.4″ tablet for media still beats the hell out of it. The S2 & S3 haven’t interested me in the slightest since they changed the AR (would mean nothing but bigger black bars for me… yay) and lowered the resolution/ppi. |KOBALT| ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ “Even Google doesn’t seem concerned about overall design too much, with the Pixels sporting more bezel than a lot of other devices. It’s the whole package that counts, not just the design itself.” – i think this is the reason I’m going to choose the PixelXL over the S8+ for my upgrade now(coming from 6P). I don’t care for the edge screen and the super tall, narrow phone. And numerous reviews have said that the Pixel is smoother/snappier UI experience overall. Don Apple sold 9 million iPads last quarter. Nothing to sneeze at. I think the main thing is that people are just holding on to their iPads longer because unlike cell phones there is not a greater need to upgrade so often. I upgraded to the iPad 2 (I think it was the 2) after owning the original iPad because running apps and browsing was becoming slow but even though my iPad is years old, it still runs pretty smoothly and still getting latest iOS updates. I just use it to web browse, watch youtube or use it to cast Youtube onto my TV. Convenient on plane or trips for stuff like when you want a bigger screen than phone, hold like a book or magazine, but don’t want to pull out a big laptop. hkklife iPad 2, if that’s indeed what you have, stopped getting updates in Aug of 2016. Don Sorry I googled my model number and it’s the first iPad Air. Almost 4 years old. Running version 10.3.2 playing with the beta hkklife Oh you’re good.

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi and NFC support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except Android Pay and a heart rate sensor. It does have an NFC chip, but it is not compatible with Android Pay. You can currently buy the Wear24 from Verizon for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Rorison Meadows II :-( you tease! Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today.

We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. Nick Coad Agreed, it's my favourite so far, but I'm really disappointed by the lack of a digital crown since it looks so useful for navigation. Boolean Corporation Mmh, maybe you already know this by now, but the Misfit has a touch enabled bezel that serves as a click/wheel and takes over the scroll/zoom functions of the digital crown. At least that's what it was announced. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Jordan L Hey, my Huawei watch just got AW 2.0 final ( I think) it's updating now. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but…) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch 🙄. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it… 😊. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies.

Don't make these mistakes! Matt Umbro on May 12, 2017 at 12:41 pm More Auditing a prospective client’s Google AdWords account is a tried-and-true sales tactic when hoping to win business. By reviewing accounts, missed opportunities may be found, while issues with campaign structure, settings and optimizations can be addressed. Many agencies have checklists and/or specific areas they review when auditing accounts. However, as AdWords becomes more complex and new features are released, the traditional audit doesn’t cut it anymore. In this post, I’ll address areas that are often neglected or not given enough thought when auditing AdWords accounts. Some are more technical than others, but the theme is that one size doesn’t fit all. Too often, our preconceived notions don’t allow us to view accounts in a different light. Understand and be open to how accounts are set up as you conduct your audits. Here are four common issues marketers run into when auditing AdWords accounts: 1. Misunderstanding conversion tracking One of the first items to be reviewed is how conversion tracking is set up. After all, conversion metrics tend to give the most insight into client goals. Along with making sure the conversion pixel is firing correctly, an audit will assess the various conversion types and how they are performing. A good place to begin is the “Conversions” section within the “Tools” tab. You can see how conversions are categorized. It’s then imperative to look at the actual web pages on which the conversions are occurring. Often, the URL will include some variation of “thank you” or “confirmation.” For example, www.example.com/thanks or www.example.com/order-confirmation. When the URL contains this form of confirmation, it’s easy to determine that the conversions are legitimate. But as more sites become responsive and utilize IFrames, they may not include a separate confirmation URL. Historically, if you saw a URL in the web pages section that didn’t appear to be a confirmation page, your first thought may have been that it was a pageview conversion. For example, the URL www.example.com/email-newsletter contains the signup form and isn’t the confirmation page. Thus, conversions may be inflated because the pixel is firing on the form, giving an inaccurate representation of performance. Though this scenario still happens, there tends to be another explanation. Some sites don’t have confirmation pages. Whether through an IFrame or the syntax of the site, when a form submission or purchase occurs, the URL resolves back to itself. Even though www.example.com/email-newsletter appears to contain the signup form, it’s actually the conversion as well. Here is where platforms such as Google Tag Manager or Google Analytics come into play. These platforms have the ability to track button clicks as conversions and showcase this data in AdWords. If you see what looks like a pageview conversion, it’s imperative that you investigate how it is tracked. It could very well be that the button click is the conversion. Instead of telling the potential client that conversions are inflated, you’ve done your research to know how the conversion is set up. 2. Focusing too much on efficiency without considering volume A few years ago, I analyzed an account’s efficiency against volume in an attempt to find the sweet spot. I wanted to see what the ideal balance was for hitting account goals but also increasing conversion volume. Needless to say, in many cases, either efficiency or volume needs to be sacrificed to improve the other. For example, if you want to bid on top-of-funnel keywords that are more expensive in an effort to capture additional traffic, your ROI will most likely decrease. This concept is important to understand when auditing accounts. Audits look to uncover wasted spend. In a vacuum, there is nothing wrong with this philosophy. However, we know that many factors come into play when analyzing account performance. As an example, a keyword that has seen 100 clicks with one last-click conversion may at first seem to be ineffective, but when digging deeper, we may find that: the keyword is assisting in the overall conversion funnel. only 20 clicks have come from mobile, including the click that resulted in the conversion. the landing page doesn’t continue what is stated in the ad copy. Unless you conduct in-depth research, your audit won’t uncover these findings. The days of the all-in-one audit automation through Excel or other tools are gone. Though these tools still provide valuable data, they only scratch the surface. Solely reviewing efficiency is too basic a view when there are many variables to consider. 3. Disregarding mobile I think we’re in the seventh or eighth “year of mobile,” but judging by many AdWords accounts, you wouldn’t know it. I constantly see accounts that have negative -100% bid modifiers on mobile devices, don’t have mobile ads, or aren’t making sound decisions based on the data. More often than not, accounts I audit see more mobile traffic than they do desktop and tablet. In many cases, there is an absence of a mobile strategy. The audit should point out recommendations that will help the client have a more effective mobile presence and lead to better conversion rates. Now that advertisers are again able to create mobile-specific campaigns, it’s worth discussing if a breakout is worthwhile. Since mobile bid modifiers can be set at the campaign and ad group levels, and advertisers can use IF statements to write mobile-specific ads, device-specific campaigns aren’t as necessary as they once were. My rule of thumb is to test a mobile-specific campaign if roughly 70 percent of impressions come from mobile devices. There are still benefits to creating mobile-specific campaigns, including the ability to: set keyword level bids at the mobile level instead of a using a bid modifier. write mobile ads without using IF statements or ad customizers. write mobile-specific ad extensions without having to check off the mobile-preferred option. It amazes me that mobile isn’t taken more seriously, but an audit should uncover actionable insights that will point the account in the right direction. 4. Not running a search term cross-pollination report Continuing the theme of digging below the surface, cross-pollination reports list which queries are triggering ads in multiple ad groups. Let’s look at a scenario where I have two ad groups around “coffee tables” and “oval coffee tables.” Each of the keywords is in modified broad match. Therefore, a search for “oval coffee tables” could trigger an ad in either ad group. The solution would be to add “oval” as a negative keyword in the “coffee tables” ad group. By taking this step, we deliberately tell Google from which ad group we want our ad to show. It’s one thing to say that the account structure is sound, but it’s another to prove it. If the cross-pollination report shows that few queries are triggering ads in the wrong ad groups, the structure is in good shape. Conversely, if many of the same queries are triggering ads in multiple ad groups, there is an issue with targeting and organization. Final thoughts Audits give great insight into how accounts are performing, but most don’t address larger account concerns. I challenge you to look at and ask questions related to themes and not just concrete numbers. It’s more important to discuss why efficiency and volume fluctuate instead of making an absolute statement such as, “If we cut x spend, our ROI will increase by y.” Or review how mobile is impacting the overall funnel, rather than just saying, “The mobile bid modifier should be x.” Though the tactical aspect has its merits, audits should lead to strategy discussions.

Google is rolling out new keyword bidding suggestions in AdWords The new feature shows suggested bids for various page positions. Ginny Marvin on May 12, 2017 at 12:20 pm More Many users around the globe are noticing a new keyword bidding interface in the AdWords UI today. Clicking to update the Max CPC on a keyword brings up a new look with suggestions tailored to the specific keyword. Kelly Baker, paid media manager at UK-based digital marketing agency Prodo, tweeted a look at the options users will see when they click to change a keyword bid: @sengineland Loving this new keyword bidding feature in @adwords, have you noticed it at all? Happy to give you more info! #ppcchat #ppc pic.twitter.com/Y2oNkt5saK — Kelly Baker (@ProdoKelly) May 12, 2017 Instead of just showing a single dialogue box like this… … Google will show bid suggestions for various page positions, even if the bid simulator is not available for the keyword. Google may show one, two or three bid suggestions depending on the current standing on the keyword bid. For example, when bids are below the first page bid, Google may just show the one bid recommendation to get shown on page one with regular frequency. Also notice the language Google is using. Instead of “top of page,” Google makes a suggestion to show “Above all organic search results.” (I can’t help but feel a little stab at SEO with that.) Instead of “first position,” Google suggests a bid to show “Above all other ads.” The new phrasing is probably clearer for newer users and also reflects the fewer ad position options with right rail ads gone. This is still rolling out, so you may not see it in your accounts just yet.

Graham May 12, 2017 Adrienne LaFrance May 12, 2017 Technology Share Tweet … LinkedIn Email Print Text Size The explosive legal battle between Uber and Waymo is headed for a public showdown. A federal judge in California denied Uber’s request for private arbitration, according to court documents filed on Thursday night. Uber’s request for arbitration would have allowed the ride-sharing giant to defend itself behind closed doors. Instead, Uber will have to go to trial to answer Waymo’s accusations that an Uber engineer stole its self-driving car designs. Uber called the judge’s decision “unfortunate” in a statement emailed to The Atlantic. “We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology [in] any forum,” an Uber spokesperson wrote. The case is poised to be among the biggest legal fights over intellectual property so far this century. The technology at stake is at the center of the emerging and potentially highly lucrative self-driving car industry, and the key players are two of the world’s top tech companies. (Waymo is the self-driving car company that originated at Google, and was rebranded in 2016.) Not only will there be a trial, but Judge William Alsup also referred the case to the U.S. Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets, a move that suggests the Uber engineer at the center of the case could face criminal charges. Waymo is accusing the former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski of secretly stealing a trove of files from the company before he quit to start his own self-driving truck startup. Uber acquired that company, Otto, for $680 million shortly after it launched last year. Levandowski has exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which played a role in Alsup’s decision to deny arbitration. “Even though he is not a defendant here,” Alsup wrote in the court filings, “Levandowski’s assertion of his Fifth Amendment privilege has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants’ ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files. As a practical matter, it is hard to imagine how consolidating proceedings as to Levandowski and defendants, whether here or in arbitration, could alleviate these difficulties.” * * * Self-driving cars are arguably the great technological promise of the 21st century. They are in that rare class of technology that might actually change the world. And not just in the way everyone in Silicon Valley talks about changing the world—but really, fundamentally change it. So much so that their dramatic life-saving potential is almost secondary to the other economic, cultural, and aesthetic transformations they would cause. Those who aren’t able to drive themselves today—people who are blind, for example—would be granted a new level of transportation freedom. Mass adoption of self-driving cars would create and destroy entire industries, alter the way people work and move through cities, and change the way those cities are designed and connected. To build the technology that prompts all this change is to be in an enormous position of power. That’s why the race to bring self-driving cars to the masses is so intense. It’s also what makes this particular competition echo other transformative moments in technological history—going all the way back to the Railroad Wars, at least. (Incidentally, there was a different kind of driverless car back then.) “The Wright brothers jump into my brain immediately,” John Leonard, an engineering professor at M.I.T., told me in 2015. “But maybe it’s kind of like a decentralized space race. Like Sputnik, but between the traditional car companies and their suppliers versus tech companies and their startups.” There’s a lot of money at stake. A lot a lot. We’re talking billions of dollars per year in potential profits, maybe more. All of the major players know this. For some companies, it is a fight to the death. Each one intends to come out on top. * * * Waymo (formerly Google) When Google (now Alphabet) launched its self-driving car program in 2009, it had no competition to speak of. Culturally, the idea of a self-driving car was novel. Even the flying cars in 20th-century science fiction tended to have human drivers. So when Google began to go public with information about the project, in 2010, its level of seriousness about the effort wasn’t yet clear. “Some of these things will turn out to be wildly successful, and others will just fade away,” one investor told The Los Angeles Times at the time, referring to Google’s suite of unusual projects. Wild success still isn’t a guarantee, but it’s now obvious that Google—which has since spun off its self-driving-car unit into a company called Waymo—is deeply invested in the work it’s doing. Its test fleet is now on public roads in four states: California (since 2009), Texas (2015), Arizona (2016), and Washington state (2016). “We’ve self-driven more than 2 million miles mostly on city streets,” Waymo says on its website. “That’s the equivalent of over 300 years of human driving experience, considering the hours we’ve spent on the road. This builds on the 1 billion miles we’ve driven in simulation in just 2016.” All that driving and a near-perfect safety record—a reputation that has undoubtedly helped buoy the public’s perception of self-driving vehicles. Uber Uber catapulted itself into the self-driving car space in truly Uberesque fashion: With a scandal. In 2015, the ride-sharing giant hired an entire department away from Carnegie Mellon—some 40 robotics experts and engineers, including several top experts in autonomous-driving systems. Since then, Uber’s commitment to the future of self-driving cars has only intensified. (Consider the business incentive of eliminating human drivers, who get a cut of every ride they give.) In 2016, Uber began testing its self-driving vehicles on public roads in Pittsburgh, it doubled down its own proprietary street-mapping system—ostensibly to reduce reliance on competitors like Google and Apple—and poached Google’s top mapping expert to do so. Uber also acquired a fledgling self-driving truck company, Otto, for $680 million in 2016—but more on that in a minute. Given the talents of its employees and how much venture capital the company has on hand, Uber has emerged as a formidable player in the emerging self-driving car industry. Yet Uber continues to be plagued by controversies. After a dustup over Uber’s refusal to seek permits for its self-driving cars in California in late 2016, the company changed course and applied for a state testing permit. In February 2017, Waymo filed a federal lawsuit claiming a former Google engineer had stolen self-driving car secrets before leaving the company to found Otto. Waymo says that when Uber acquired Otto, the former Google engineer used the information he allegedly stole to help build a circuit board for Uber’s self-driving car systems. The legal battle is poised to be the first major intellectual-property fight of the driverless car era. Apple Apple remains one of the more mysterious and intriguing players in the self-driving car game. On one hand, Apple can’t afford not to pursue this emerging technology if many of its major competitors are. On the other, Apple? A car company? To be fair, though, that’s what people said of Google in 2010. And not all self-driving car companies will manufacturer vehicles themselves; some will just lease out the self-driving software for auto manufacturers. For years it was rumored that Apple had a secret self-driving car project in the works. But there were also reports that the project— which according to The Wall Street Journal had hundreds of dedicated employees as of 2016—was plagued by organizational and managerial problems. It wasn’t until December of 2016 that Apple officially made it known that it is working in some capacity on self-driving cars, via a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. “The company is investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation,” wrote Steve Kenner, Apple’s director of product integrity, “and is excited about the potential of automated systems in many areas, including transportation.” Other than that, however, Apple has remained characteristically secretive about its work. Tesla Tesla wants to bring driverless cars to the market, but it has a markedly different approach than Waymo, which may be its biggest competition. While Google wants to build fully self-driving systems from the ground-up, its critics say this will take too long. In the interest of making everybody safer sooner, Tesla is adding increasingly autonomous systems, bit by bit, to its existing high-end vehicles. But there’s a big debate over which method—fully autonomous versus incrementally autonomous—is actually better for public safety. Tesla’s CEO, Elon Musk, has said it’s “morally reprehensible” to wait until the technology is advanced enough for complete autonomy. Yet critics of the Tesla approach say that here-and-there semi-autonomous features may present too much of a gray area for today’s drivers to safely navigate. The marketing around Autopilot, the current Tesla system, has arguably left people with the impression that Tesla’s cars are more autonomous than they really are. The very name, Autopilot, certainly suggests it might be okay for human drivers to stop paying attention. This concern came up again in the spring of 2016, when a Tesla driver who was using the Autopilot feature died in a car accident. At the time, Tesla’s Autopilot feature was in beta mode, meaning the drivers who tested it on public roads were required to acknowledge any risks involved. Federal investigators eventually concluded Autopilot was not to blame in the fatal crash. Tesla already claims on its website that all of its vehicles “have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.” This is, at best, slightly misleading. Tesla’s hardware may eventually allow for a “full self-driving” system, but it’s definitely not there yet. Whichever approach to building a truly autonomous car is the right one, Tesla’s sense of urgency is helping to quicken the pace of competition in the driverless-car space. Legacy automakers Like Tesla, several legacy automakers are announcing their entry into the driverless-car space with incremental assisted-driving systems. This approach makes sense for them: After all, they already manufacture cars that people can go and buy—something that isn’t true of Apple, Google, or Uber—which means one of the best hopes for legacy carmakers to stay in business is to evolve now rather than attempting to play catchup later (which they may still have to do). But some legacy companies have gone farther than others. While nearly every major automaker pays lip service to the importance of developing autonomous vehicles, only some have backed up their talk with action. Volvo stands out among the more committed, for instance. In a project Volvo is calling Drive Me, the automaker will put a fleet of 100 driverless cars on the highways in Sweden. (As with tests by Google and Uber on public roads in the United States, humans will sit behind the wheel, ready to take control of the vehicles if needed.) In March 2017, Toyota unveiled its first self-driving car  prototype. The car came out of Toyota’s artificial intelligence research institute, which it launched with a $1 billion investment in 2015. Ford Motor Company has also made its efforts increasingly visible. Ford announced in August 2016 that it plans to be “mass producing vehicles capable of driving fully autonomously” by 2021. Six months later, the automaker announced a $1 billion investment in the software company Argo AI, a software startup specializing in self-driving cars. (“Ford is the majority stakeholder in Argo AI, but we are structured to operate with substantial independence,” Argo AI says.) “This work is easily the most challenging of my career, and it may be the most important, as well,” wrote Chris Brewer, the head of engineering for Ford’s Autonomous Vehicle Development department, in a blog post in March 2016. “Come to think about it, who better to develop a self-driving car than a company that’s been making cars for more than 100 years?” As with Ford and Argo AI, several other tech firms and automakers are forging partnerships. Chrysler and Google announced in May 2016 that they would team up to make a driverless minivan, while Volvo and Uber announced a partnership in August 2016. Newcomers We should expect to see more startups in the self-driving car space in the years to come. One example is Drive.ai, which launched in August 2016 and is creating deep-learning software for driverless cars. There will be others. Chris Urmson, the longtime head of Google’s driverless car initiative, left the company in August 2016, at a time when the project seemed to be shedding several key players. In December 2016, the technology-focused news website Recode reported that Urmson is starting his own self-driving-cars venture. Technology history tells us that the first company to build a technology is not always the company that ends up making a windfall. That may well be the case in the realm of autonomous vehicles. There are many uncertainties in all this, but one thing is clear: The cultural space occupied by the automobile is undergoing rapid, radical transformation. There are sure to be big winners and losers along the way.

Twitter Facebook Most Popular Presented by Bettman / Getty Five Reasons the Comey Affair Is Worse Than Watergate James Fallows A journalist who covered Nixon’s fall 45 years ago explains why the current challenge to America may be more severe—and the democratic system less capable of handling it. The tangled affair now known as Watergate began 45 years ago, before most of today’s U.S. population had even been born. (The median age of Americans is about 38, so most people in the country were born in 1979 or thereafter.) Thus for most people “Watergate” is a historical allusion—obviously negative in its implications, since it led to the only presidential resignation in American history, but probably hazy in its details. For me, Watergate is anything but hazy. I’d left graduate school and begun my first magazine job, with The Washington Monthly, in the fall of 1972, as news of the scandal emerged. Over the next two years, until Richard Nixon’s resignation, I was living in D.C. and tracking the daily progress in clue-following and domino-toppling via stories in The Washington Post and elsewhere—and then the riveting, televised Watergate hearings that made national celebrities of politicians like Senators Howard Baker and Sam Ervin, and of White House aides like Alexander Butterfield (who revealed the existence of Nixon’s secret system for taping White House conversations) and John Dean (who as White House counsel had told Nixon, “there is a cancer on the presidency”). Anyone of conscious age in that time can probably remember the jolts to national sentiment that the near-daily revelations evoked. Continue Reading Zohar Lazar How Pixar Lost Its Way Christopher Orr For 15 years, the animation studio was the best on the planet. Then Disney bought it. A well-regarded Hollywood insider recently suggested that sequels can represent “a sort of creative bankruptcy.” He was discussing Pixar, the legendary animation studio, and its avowed distaste for cheap spin-offs. More pointedly, he argued that if Pixar were only to make sequels, it would “wither and die.” Now, all kinds of industry experts say all kinds of things. But it is surely relevant that these observations were made by Ed Catmull, the president of Pixar, in his best-selling 2014 business-leadership book. Yet here comes Cars 3, rolling into a theater near you this month. You may recall that the original Cars, released back in 2006, was widely judged to be the studio’s worst film to date. Cars 2, which followed five years later, was panned as even worse. And if Cars 3 isn’t disheartening enough, two of the three Pixar films in line after it are also sequels: The Incredibles 2 and (say it isn’t so!) Toy Story 4.

If you're inclined to downplay the termination of FBI Director James Comey, reasoning that he was a flawed leader, or that President Trump was legally entitled to fire him, or that many of the Democrats objecting to his termination previously criticized him, or that liberals are so freaked out by the president that their latest freakout cannot be taken seriously, a civil libertarian like me is unlikely to change your mind. Long before Donald Trump decided to run for president, when Barack Obama had almost a full term left and Hillary Clinton seemed like his likeliest successor, I argued in “All the Infrastructure a Tyrant Would Need, Courtesy of Bush and Obama,” that “we're counting on having angels in office and making ourselves vulnerable to devils. Bush and Obama have built infrastructure any devil would lust after.” Continue Reading Amir Cohen / Reuters The Fidget Spinner Explains the World Ian Bogost The latest cultural trend is a perfect fossil of human life in the immediate present. There’s a new, dumb trend: the fidget spinner. It’s a toy like a top, but spun in the hand rather than on a surface. The user holds a pad at the center, and flicks one of three rounded blades. The spinner rotates around a bearing at the center. The light weight of the device and the low friction of the bearing allows it to spin for a long time. What is it for? The fidget spinner has been framed as just a toy—but also as a stress-relief tool, a classroom menace, a treatment for ADHD, and a possible salve to smartphone addiction, among other things. Fidget spinners might or might not be any of those things, but at their core they are something more, and something stranger: the perfect material metaphor for everyday life in early 2017, for good and for ill.

Graham A letter from the president’s attorneys says he has no income or loans in Russia—“with a few exceptions.” Updated on May 12 at 3:25 p.m. Donald Trump has received more than $100 million in income from Russian sources in one-time transactions over the last decade, but does not have any outstanding debts or holdings in the country, his lawyers asserted in a letter that emerged on Friday. The letter, signed by Sheri Dillon and William Nelson of the firm Morgan Lewis, states: With a few exceptions—as detailed below—your tax returns do not reflect (1) any income of any type from Russian sources, (2) any debt owed by you or [the Trump Organization] to Russian lenders or any interest paid by you or TTO to Russian lenders, (3) any equity investments by Russian persons or entities in entities controlled by your or TTO, or (4) any equity or debt investments by or or TTO in Russia entities.

In a wide-ranging interview with Time magazine, Trump described his disgust with the catapult system known as Electro-Magnetic Aircraft Launch System, nicknamed EMALS, aboard the USS Gerald R. Ford. (Time has published only excerpts from the interview, not a full transcript.) The president described wanting to scrap EMALS, a key technological upgrade at the center of the multibillion-dollar carrier project, and return to steam. I said, “You don’t use steam anymore for catapult?” “No sir.” I said, “Ah, how is it working?” “Sir, not good. Not good. Doesn’t have the power. You know the steam is just brutal. You see that sucker going and steam’s going all over the place, there’s planes thrown in the air.” It sounded bad to me. Digital. They have digital. What is digital? And it’s very complicated, you have to be Albert Einstein to figure it out. And I said—and now they want to buy more aircraft carriers. I said, “What system are you going to be—” “Sir, we’re staying with digital.” I said, “No you’re not. You going to goddamned steam, the digital costs hundreds of millions of dollars more money and it’s no good.” Continue Reading Bill Hudson / AP He Was a Crook Hunter S. Thompson A scathing obituary of Richard Nixon, originally published in Rolling Stone on June 16, 1994 MEMO FROM THE NATIONAL AFFAIRS DESK DATE: MAY 1, 1994 FROM: DR. HUNTER S. THOMPSON SUBJECT: THE DEATH OF RICHARD NIXON: NOTES ON THE PASSING OF AN AMERICAN MONSTER.... HE WAS A LIAR AND A QUITTER, AND HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BURIED AT SEA.... BUT HE WAS, AFTER ALL, THE PRESIDENT. "And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird." ---Revelation 18:2 Richard Nixon is gone now, and I am poorer for it. He was the real thing -- a political monster straight out of Grendel and a very dangerous enemy. He could shake your hand and stab you in the back at the same time. He lied to his friends and betrayed the trust of his family. Not even Gerald Ford, the unhappy ex-president who pardoned Nixon and kept him out of prison, was immune to the evil fallout. Ford, who believes strongly in Heaven and Hell, has told more than one of his celebrity golf partners that "I know I will go to hell, because I pardoned Richard Nixon." Continue Reading Gunpowder & Sky Hounds of Love Is One of the Most Horrifying Films of the Year David Sims The Australian kidnapping drama is not for the faint of heart. Hounds of Love opens in extreme slow motion. At first, the group of teenage girls we’re focused on seem frozen like statues, but the basketballs they’re tossing are flying through the air with a kind of hypnotic, dreadful sluggishness. It takes a few seconds to realize they’re moving, and a few more to realize we’re spying on them. The camera (whipping around this tableau with far greater speed) is from the point of view of someone in a car who’s driving past and transfixed by the girls. This skin-crawling scene feels voyeuristic without showing anything beyond a schoolyard basketball game and primes the pump for the horrifying events to follow. A well-made, restrained piece of horror cinema, Hounds of Love is nonetheless almost unwatchable—a serial-killer drama that keeps much of its murderous activity off-screen and leaves most of its details to the imagination. Of course, it’s all the more distressing as a result. The Australian director Ben Young’s debut film drew both praise and concern over its arguably exploitative content on its release in his home country last year, not least because the fictional events it depicts seem very similar to the real-life murders committed by David and Catherine Birnie. But if you can stomach its content, Hounds of Love is an undoubtedly effective work, an impressive calling card for a director sure to attract the eye of Hollywood. Continue Reading Ebru Yildiz / PolyVinyl Records The Depressingly Familiar Allegations Against PWR BTTM Spencer Kornhaber The duo were building a career by subverting rock and roll tropes—and then were accused of fulfilling one of the darkest ones. When Blink-182’s Mark Hoppus sang of being 23 and still acting like a freshman in his band’s 1999 smash “What’s My Age Again?”, he crystalized perhaps the default concern of pop punk. Rage against age—and the underlying feeling that you’re not living according to expectations—has been echoed in sneering songs from Descendents to NOFX to Paramore. In the past few years, the charismatic young pop-punk(-ish) band PWR BTTM have built a promising career by, as the professors at the New York liberal-arts college where they formed might put it, queering that sensibility. “My teenage angst will be with me well into my 30s,” PWR BTTM’s Liv Bruce brattishly deadpans for the recent single “Answer My Text,” in which the trans singer imagines the teenage girlhood she never had. “When you are queer, you’re always 19,” Ben Hopkins says with a sad little yodel on the waltzing “LOL.” In this, the band mined the subtext of pop punk and emo—two genres that, thanks to their frequent performance of male vulnerability, have long drawn the schoolyard taunt of “gay” from certain meathead masses. On both their 2015 debut Ugly Cherries and their new album Pageant, PWR BTTM sang of feeling out-of-step not because of vague nonconformism but because society literally doesn’t recognize them. Continue Reading Jim Bourg / Reuters If There Are White House Recordings, They Could Be Subpoenaed David A. Graham President Trump warned James Comey that there might be “tapes” of their conversation—and if there are, it would be illegal to destroy them. Maybe there are recordings from the Trump White House; maybe there aren’t. On the one hand, President Trump seemed to threaten the former FBI director in a tweet Friday morning, writing, “James Comey better hope that there are no ‘tapes’ of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!” Later on Friday, Press Secretary Sean Spicer repeatedly refused to comment on the tweet and whether or not tapes exist. But if they do exist, those tapes could be subject to a subpoena demanding that the White House turn them over. That could either resolve the question and expose the inner workings of the White House, or it could spark a constitutional crisis. Former presidents famously did record goings-on in the White House, especially John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and, disastrously, Richard Nixon. It’s believed that no president since Nixon has taped in the White House, in order to avoid the problems Nixon faced—though, of course, it’s possible some did so secretly.

A late but concerted campaign is under way to convince Google to select Scranton as one of the cities where the Internet giant plans to build - for free - its experimental fiber-optic network. Proponents are rushing to complete the city's application by Friday's deadline for local governments and residents to express their interest, and they're asking the public to get involved by joining the effort through the Facebook social networking site. "The response has been tremendous," said Tim Moran, who heads interactive sales and interactive media at WNEP-TV and who helped get the initiative off the ground about two weeks ago. "I think people understand this could be potentially a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for this city." Links: Facebook page Google nomination form www.thefibercity.org Substantial payoff The payoff could be substantial: $100 million to $200 million worth of technology infrastructure and the promise of Internet speeds more than 100 times faster than what most Americans have access to today. Google has not determined the size of the trial but expects to provide the service to at least 50,000 and possibly as many as 500,000 people, most likely in multiple communities. Given what is at stake, hundreds of cities are expected to vie to be a Google Fiber for Communities project recipient. Many have gone to extremes in an attempt to get Google's attention since the company announced its plans in mid-February. Topeka, Kan., informally changed its name to Google, Kan., for the month of March. The mayor of Duluth, Minn., took a plunge into chilly Lake Superior - and posted the resulting video on YouTube with the challenge, "You want Google Fiber, you jump in Lake Superior!" Not to be outdone, the mayor of Sarasota, Fla., which temporarily renamed itself "Google Island," got into a tank filled with sharks. Mayor Chris Doherty said Tuesday he has no plans to rename the city "Googleton" or splash into the Lackawanna River, but he has asked information technology director Frank Swietnicki to work with Rob Watts of the Great Valley Technology Alliance to prepare the city's application. 'Be in it to win it' "You'd love to get something like this for free. It would be great for the community," he said. "You never know what is going to happen, but like they say at the Pennsylvania Lottery, you have to be in it to win it." Mr. Moran said that after he learned about the competition, he contacted Mr. Watts at Great Valley and brought in Jack Reager of BlackOut Design. Together, they put together a plan of action. Presentations were made to the mayor and city council, both of whom agreed to cooperate, Mr. Moran said. The group also reached out to local educational and medical institutions, along with private companies, for letters of recommendation that will become part of the application. The publishers of The Times-Tribune are among those who have submitted letters in support of the effort. BlackOut Design set up a Web site - www.thefibercity.org - where members of the public can click on the Facebook link and become fans of the initiative, Mr. Moran said. As of Tuesday evening, nearly 1,100 people had signed on. Mr. Moran also encouraged Web site visitors to use the Facebook link to individually nominate Scranton for the project, saying community support is one of the factors Google will consider. The goal is to have the city chosen as a Google Fiber community, Mr. Moran said. But even if it is passed over, broad support for the initiative can demonstrate to the rest of the country that Scranton would be a willing and viable location for future technology projects. "There are a ton of great things happening here in business and technology that people might not be aware of," he said.

Report observer,  25 March 2010 kl. 13:11 Besides proximity to NY/NJ/Philadelphia etc, our 'The Office' show links, and the many University communities, another angle could be to play UP the ragged infrastructure and historically weak tech culture. IF such a venture succeeded, the turnaround could be dramatic. This would highlight more the value of Google Fiber community concept. No one would surprised if it helped a more 'modern' or tech oriented city. Play off Scranton's 'coal belt' rep. If Google Fiber helps Scranton, it can be expected to help 'anywhere USA'. Also, since Scranton is seen as so 'needy', we could cooperate BIG time not as an afterthought. Play these angles up. Report MobyT,  25 March 2010 kl. 13:03 You need to go eat some "Fiber" SWB.

Scranton also has an ace up its sleeve. That is its proximity to New York City and with the Pocono communities as part of the region, it becomes more appealing to Google. Hopefully those writing the proposal have included some computer geeks from the many universities in the region who "know" this stuff.

It has just about as much credibility as saying that Google would pass up Scranton because he will not work with council. Also, you state that the mayor is for progress. Fine, maybe he is, but under his two terms, we do have an increase in debt, which someone will have to pay back at some time. Do you actually think though that city council wants to see the city fall apart? Get real. Just because the members of council do not always agree with the mayor does not mean their actions are impropper. Report Reader II,  24 March 2010 kl. 16:39 Google has opened a national competition requesting proposal for sities and towns to tell them why they (the town) should be a fiber hub. There is a lot of competition out there and it has already made national news, including Topeka, Kansas changing its name to Google, Kansas for a day. Other towns have done similar things to get Google's eye. What has Scranton done? Why did Scranton delay in beginning work on preparation? Has anyone ever seen a proposal in response to competitive solicitation of the type that Google has in mind? An offerer gets one shot at looking good. Anything not perfect gets magnified and a slapped-together proposal looks just like an ill-fitting black tuxedo with brown shoes (borrowed from the late George Goebel). The reference to the rail proposal, the Phoebe Snow, and the Bellevue Colliery are satirical but the writer who admonished that I should stay on topic, fiber not steel, apparently sees satire as a competitor to Michelin. If Scranton keeps thinking with a coal and steel paradigm, fiber will be in cereal and muffins, as evidenced by the front page story of today's Times about the Jersey Central station.

Some of the features Samsung brings to the table are nice — they were the first to introduce split screen apps to Android, after all. But some find the heavy use of white backgrounds on the Galaxy S8 a bit of an eyesore, and quickly install a darker theme. Others find the home screen layout a little too limited in customizability, and for those people we’ve highlighted some of the best custom launchers you can download on your Galaxy S8 to bring a personal touch to one of the most common phones on the market. The five launchers I looked at all have their own unique features and quirks, but they’re each going to be a good fit for a different kind of user. Google Now Launcher – Free Google’s own launcher, based around the software experience on the Pixel, is as Android as it gets. It may not be the most customizable — in fact, there are less options here than on Samsung’s Touchwiz launcher. There’s no support for icon packs or gesture shortcuts (any launcher that doesn’t allow for a swipe down to access the notification shade is a no-go for me personally), but Google Now is just a swipe away from the home screen, and that kind of tight integration is part of what makes this launcher so appealing for long-time Nexus and Pixel users. Apex Launcher – Free Coming off of a three-year hiatus, Apex Launcher brings some much-needed custom options to Google’s take on the home screen. Though the default configuration is pretty similar to the Google Now Launcher, Apex brings icon pack support, icon scaling, the ability to change scrolling animations, a paginated dock, home screen looping, gestures, and much more. Peek Launcher – Free Peek is a unique launcher with a single home screen that displays eight frequently used apps and a T9-style keyboard. The launcher learns your app usage habits and adjusts the shortcuts accordingly, and when you need to access an app not displayed on the home screen you can either type the first few letters on the keypad or swipe up for a traditional app drawer. There’s no widget support, and taking such an unconventional approach means this will probably require more adjustment than the other launchers on this list, but it’s certainly an interesting take for the ultra-minimalist. Arrow Launcher – Free Microsoft’s Arrow Launcher feels like a beautiful and smooth marriage of Samsung’s Touchwiz UX and the Google Now Launcher. It offers to use Bing Images to automatically set a new wallpaper every day, and the home screen automatically imports the layout of your default launcher upon initial setup. To the left of the home screen is a hub similar to Bixby that displays your recent photos, text messages, upcoming events, and more. Action Launcher – Free My go-to for years has been Action Launcher. There are traces of Material Design all over the UI, and it offers all the customization you’d expect from a custom launcher, from icon packs to grid resizing and finer details. What makes Action Launcher unique is its sliding panels; swiping in from the left pulls in a vertically scrolling app list, eliminating the need for an app drawer icon taking up precious home screen space, and swiping in from the right opens a drawer that holds additional apps and widgets. Think of the latter as a sort of floating home screen that you can access from any page in the launcher. You can also enable covers and shutters, which hide folders and widgets behind single app icons — tap to open the app being displayed, and swipe up to access the hidden feature. Have you already been using a custom launcher, or do you tend to stick with what the OEM provides you? Has this article given you any new ideas for how to use and customize your phone?

Video Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6 Camera Shootout Street View is finally ready for its closeup. Earlier this week, Google announced a new certification program for 360-degree cameras, letting anyone shoot and upload their interactive experiences right to Maps. And now, Google is looking to use those images and videos to help get you from point A to point B. The next time you go to start a new drive, you’ll notice something a little different about your route. A new tweak to the Google Maps interface puts a greater emphasis on Street View, showing small pictures of each turn alongside the description, where available. When you tap one of the thumbnails, you’ll get a full view of the scene, with a route marker indicating where to turn or what to do. Also new to Google Maps is an even smaller change to the navigation. The bottom navigation bar has been tweaked. As seen above, most screens now include the standard Android navigation bar and added new explicit buttons to take you to different screens. It’s a matter of taste, but personally, we liked it better the old way. The changes appear to be server-side ones that aren’t tied to a specific update, but if you aren’t seeing them, you can try side-loading the latest Google-signed APK of Google Maps from APK Mirror. The new Street View images aren’t active in the iOS app yet. The impact on you on the road: The addition of Street View pictures is a small change and one most people aren’t likely to notice, but it could be the start of a greater emphasis on real-world mapping. Google Maps is far and away the best navigation app on our phones, but being able to traverse more of the world with actual imagery would truly put it in a class by itself.

Ron Amadeo - May 12, 2017 6:05 pm UTC reader comments 49 Share this story The Samsung Z4, a phone to be released in 2017. This is definitely a cheap phone. The back looks to be plastic. We're going to guess this is the power button. Up top looks like a fingernail slot to rip the back off, meaning the battery is probably removable. Here's a gold version. The volume rocker. Samsung says the device has "2.5D" glass, and it sure looks like the side of the glass panel is curved a bit. Next week, most of the tech press will be focused on Google I/O 2017, Google's big developer conference. But Samsung just happens to be holding its own competing conference at the same time: the Tizen Developer Conference 2017. Here, developers will (supposedly) gather to talk about the latest Tizen OS improvements and development practices. To celebrate, Samsung announced a new flagship Tizen smartphone today, the Samsung Z4. Further ReadingThe first Tizen smartphone isn’t an “Android killer”—it’s a bad Android cloneWhile Samsung uses Google's Android OS in nearly all of its smartphones, the company has been building a Linux-based OS of its own, called Tizen, for some time now. Tizen runs on Samsung's smartwatches, fitness devices, TVs, smart appliances, and a tiny handful of smartphones. We reviewed the first-ever Tizen smartphone, the Samsung Z1, back in 2015, and we weren't impressed. It felt like a hollow copy of Android without any apps, so why not just run Android? Tizen is apparently not very secure, either, with a security researcher saying, "It may be the worst code I've ever seen," and "Everything you can do wrong there, they do it." A WikiLeaks data dump even claimed that the CIA can turn Samsung's (Tizen-based) smart TVs into remote listening devices. Samsung continues to plug away at its operating system, though, and the most interesting part of the Samsung Z4 may be that it launches with Tizen 3.0, a brand-new version of the OS. Tizen 3.0 comes with support for the new "Vulkan" graphics API, a switch from the X Window System to Wayland (Tizen is really Linux-based), 64-bit support, multi-user support, Samsung's S-Voice voice assistant, and tons of other features. Despite the recent news, Samsung's Tizen 3.0 page claims, "Security has been one of Tizen’s major strengths." It then goes on to describe a "new security model" in 3.0 that will make managing security policies easier, plus a new privacy guard. Further ReadingSamsung’s Tizen is riddled with security flaws, amateurishly writtenAs the name suggests, the Z4 is the fourth major Tizen phone. But it doesn't seem like Tizen hardware has progressed much since our last review. The Z4 is still an unattractive budget phone, that, like past Tizen models, will probably retail for around $100. It has a 4.5-inch, 800×480 display, an unspecified "Quad core 1.5GHz" processor, 1GB of RAM, 5MP front and rear camera, "USB 2.0" (we're guessing MicroUSB), and a 2050mAh battery. These would definitely not be "flagship" specs for an established operating system, but, for Tizen, bottom-of-the-barrel $100 phones are all Samsung is willing to commit. Samsung says the Z4 will launch in "select countries, starting in India" sometime this month. It will also be on display at the Tizen Developer Conference, which runs May 16-17.

However, she noted that professionals in the area of tourism do not take advantage of this trend, as only 8 percent of Greek hotels and businesses use the Internet to accept bookings via their websites. In an interview with the Athens Macedonian News Agency, Founta explained that Grow Greek Tourism Online is an initiative that Google launched in cooperation with the Tourism Ministry, the Greek Tourism Organization and the Association of Greek Tourist Enterprises to help Greece’s tourism businesses to upgrade their digital skills and tools and improve their internet presence while taking full advantage of their Internet opportunities. We inform the businesses, she added, on simple issues such as how to build a website, how to get into map services, how to get into social media, and have access to Google’s tools and more advanced topics such as how to use their mobile phones and to attract more customers.

The existence of Fuschia was first discovered back in August when little existed beyond a basic kernel. Eight months on, there's a lot more to see. The operating system is emerging into a state where its core components are functional, there's work on a sub-system apps and the beginnings of a radical new user interface. The UI is called Armadillo and is written in Flutter, Google's new cross-platform programming SDK for building high-performance 120fps mobile apps. As Flutter apps can run on iOS and Android, it's possible to compile the source code available on GitHub and run it on a current phone. As Ars Technica reports, Armadillo throws away many of the principles of Android's basic design, including the home screen. Instead, a single vertically scrolling list contains shortcuts, status information and Google Now cards. The centre of the display is dominated by your profile picture, a battery percentage meter and the date and time. Fuschia OS screenshot via Ars Technica. Multiple instances of apps can be opened in tabs. Ars Technica When you tap on the profile picture, Armadillo's implementation of Android's Quick Settings menu appears. There are icons for connectivity options and sliders for variable controls like brightness and volume. Unlike Android, Armadillo includes powerful multi-window features to appeal to power users. You can arrange apps side-by-side in a flexible split screen view. The split ratio can be adjusted and up to four apps added to the display. If you'd rather browse everything full screen, there's a tab strip to keep track of open windows. Armadillo is currently far from being complete and most of the UI is built from placeholder assets. The implementation indicates that Fuschia will be something entirely new from Google, potentially introducing a different way of interacting with mobile devices. Google's intentions for the project are not clear and it's possible it'll be shelved before it receives an official announcement. Fuschia OS screenshot via Ars Technica. The platform supports flexible window arrangements. Ars Technica Ars Technica reports this is unlikely though. In Fuschia's open IRC chat channel, developer Travis Geiselbrecht told the news site that the OS "isn't a toy thing" or a "dumping ground of a dead thing that we don't care about anymore." The platform seems to be a serious project for the company that could indicate it's planning a reimagining of Android. Whether Fuschia really will replace Android is far from evident right now. What is clear is it's already solving some of the most major issues with Google's highly successful first mobile platform. Performance problems, a lack of multitasking capabilities for tablets and dramatic variations in UI between devices have long frustrated users and more recently Google itself. Android's update problems are also well-documented, an issue which exasperates its security weaknesses. If Android were to be rebooted, Fuschia seems to be an ideal candidate to take its place. It's too early to tell where the project is headed but it's possible that the next few years will see Google launch its second major mobile ecosystem, without the oversights of the first.

The ongoing tussle between YouTube and the music industry took a new turn this week when Google assured everyone that its video platform doesn't have any negative impact on the other streaming music services -- despite all the free music it offers. From a report: A Google-commissioned report into how YouTube impacts on the wider music economy has -- somewhat unsurprisingly -- found that the hugely popular, yet much-maligned platform significantly drives sales and stops users from visiting pirate music services. According to a European study carried out by RBB Economics, if music content was removed from YouTube around 85 percent of the time that users spend on the platform would switch to lower value channels, such as TV, radio or internet radio. RBB claimed there would also be a significant increase in time spent listening to pirated content (up 29 percent), while only 15 percent of heavy users, defined as someone who watches more than 20 hours of music videos per month, would switch to higher value offerings like subscription streaming services. In the U.K., that number increases to 19 percent; in France it's 12 percent. [...] In response, music trade bodies poured scorn on the paper's findings. "Google's latest publicity push once again seeks to distract from the fact that YouTube, essentially the world's largest on-demand music service, is failing to license music on a fair basis and compensate artists and producers properly by claiming it is not liable for the music it is making available," reads a statement from IFPI. "Services like YouTube, that are not licensing music on fair terms, hinder the development of a sustainably healthy digital music market," claimed the international trade body, repeating its regular call for tighter regulation around safe harbour licensing. business google money ← You may like to read: → New Ransomware 'Jaff' Spotted; Malware Groups Pushing 5M Emails Per Hour To Circulate It World Reacts To The Worst Mass Shooting In U.S. History The Case Against a Universal Basic Income The FBI Recommends Not To Indict Hillary Clinton For Email Misconduct Trump's Next Immigration Move To Affect H-1B Visas; Require Tech Companies To Try To Hire Americans First: Bloomberg Peter Thiel Is Joining Donald Trump's Transition Team Blocked From US Tech Investing, China Goes To Israel Instead Google Releases Study Defending YouTube's Value To Music Biz; Trade Bodies Hit Back More | Reply Login Google Releases Study Defending YouTube's Value To Music Biz; Trade Bodies Hit Back Post Load All Comments  Full  Abbreviated  Hidden /Sea Score: 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 More | Reply Login   Nickname: Password: Public Terminal Forgot your password?

Multi-platinum pop artists make a lot of money on royalties (even in the era of streaming and digital sales, though not as much as they used to) and for them touring serves primarily to pump up their sales, not to generate income. Many of them lose money on touring, because they put on such extravagant, expensive shows. For most other genres, it's the other way around, as you said.

Sky pundit Thierry Henry has been praising the humility of his former Juventus team-mate and it’s no surprise. The Italian is hard-working and a real class act who seems to have the respect of most, if not all of his charges. After winning the title, he was very quick to praise his players and his staff and very reluctant to take any of the credit for the title win. It is fair to say one of his recent predecessors is not noted for the same magnanimity as Conte in victory or defeat. Indeed, it will be interesting to see how long passes before the individual in question tries to take some or all of the credit for this title win of Chelsea’s.

We gave them a really good game and we wanted to do that tonight. We needed all the breaks tonight and we didn’t need them to get the break.” He goes on to say that he can’t fault the efforts of his players, but some of their decision-making at crucial moments left a lot to be desired. I suspect he’s referring to the two counter-attacks West Brom had from corners, where they messed up despite having a numerical advantage.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.35pm EDT 17:35 A remarkable statistic ...

The Premiership should look at ways of introducing some controlled ‘randomness’ to give the lesser teams a chance, to better reflect all aspects of the game, not just how much money clubs can spend on players.

The warrant, which surfaced in March, was seen at the time by internet privacy advocates as "breathtakingly broad" and setting a troubling precedent on how law agencies could obtain private information. Google issued a statement Friday via e-mail: "We objected to the warrant and significantly narrowed its scope to the point that only one record was produced. We were pleased to resolve this in a way that preserves our users' privacy." Neither Google nor Edina officials explained how the search was specified or what information was turned over to police. As of Friday, no arrest had been made in the case, Edina spokeswoman Jennifer Bennerotte said, but she declined to comment on the investigation. William McGeveran, a law professor at the University of Minnesota, said Google's pushback addressed the central issue. "Google, by working to narrow it down and focus it, was responding to what was really objectionable," he said. "[The warrant] was asking for a broad swath of people's searches that was overly inclusive." But McGeveran said he is concerned that issuing similar warrants could become a common practice. "I'm still worried about what would happen next time," he said. "Will another judge do this in the future?" He added that other search engines may not fight as hard to protect personal information. Google initially declined to honor a subpoena to provide the same information to Edina. Edina Detective David Lindman filed the warrant request to locate the person who attempted to steal $28,500 from an Edina resident through credit fraud. Hennepin County District Judge Gary Larson issued the warrant in early February. The warrant asked Google to provide Edina police with Social Security numbers, account and payment information, and IP (internet protocol) and MAC (media access control) addresses for anyone who searched the resident's name on the search engine from Dec. 1, 2016 through Jan. 7. Technology website Ars Technica called the Edina warrant "perhaps the most expansive one we've seen unconnected to the U.S. national security apparatus." Internet law experts questioned its ability to withstand constitutional scrutiny. Assistant County Attorney Thad Tudor asked on Thursday to seal the warrant until the investigation was complete, according to documents. If the warrant were made public, he said, it could interfere with the search "or severely hamper an ongoing investigation." Google contacted Lindman on April 27 to say the results from the search warrant were available, according to court documents. The information was taken in as evidence. According to Google's website, it often works with the agency issuing a search warrant to narrow the request and provide only the relevant information. motarola@startribune.com 612-673-4753 motarola123 View Comments Read our comment standards StarTribune.com welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive, mutually respectful exchanges over news topics.

Stay Connected With Hypebot.com « Spotify, Blockchain And Music's Future [Thomas Euler] | Main | Spotify To Forgo IPO, Direct List On NYSE As Early A Q4 [REPORT] » Dear Google, You Could Start Fixing Content ID By Taking Down Dozens Of YouTube Videos On How To Defeat It While some in the industry may be putting a lot of faith in YouTube's Content ID system, the method by which it identifies and removes videos infringing on copyright can be easily gotten around, although the question remains how much the Content ID team at Google knows about this industry knows. __________________________ Guest post by Chris Castle of Music Technology Policy Both Peter Kafka and Lyor Cohen seem to be mystified by concerns about how YouTube shakes down artists and songwriters in Kafka’s interview with Lyor in Recode.  It should come as no shock that Google chose Kafka (a long-time Google fan boy) as the safe interviewer for Lyor, but it really is stunning how oblivious Lyor is to how to scam Content ID which has leaked like the proverbial sieve since its inception.  And unlike Lyor, I’m just not willing to believe that the Content ID team at Google doesn’t know exactly what they are doing.  Or not doing. Here’s Lyor’s money quote from the interview: When I told [Google’s Content ID developers] about the albums, they said, “Yeah, they jumped over our Content ID by speeding up the tempo of the music, slightly. We’ve already got a solution for it.” I had them walk me through the process. I felt so proud that I could really talk to people in the industry that had this feeling about Content ID, and finding bad actors, and confidently say, “We’ve got a team that is dedicated to fixing this.” The more we frustrate bad actors, the more we can stop cottage industries. They’re just going to give up, at a certain point. And I think the industry will feel really good about that. Couple facts:  Content ID works by comparing the soundtrack of a YouTube video to an audio fingerprint reference of a known recording.  Let’s be clear–the Navy has used psychoacoustic fingerprinting since World War II–essentially the same technology as Content ID.  Remember Jonesey in the Hunt For Red October.  They called it “sonar” in the movie, but it was actually a method for capturing a sound in the wild and comparing it to a known sound. Jonesey was able to identify Red October by manipulating the speed to create a new fingerprint with which to track the Soviet submarine.  Red October was able to fool the U.S. Navy acoustic fingerprints by an new engine type that made a sound the service had not recorded before.  Jones manipulated the speed to determine if the sound the database identified as a biologic was actually man made.  Once identified by the reference copy, the database could be programmed to recognize the sound captured in the wild repeatedly as long as it did not vary from the reference version. The acoustic fingerprint is a mathematical rendering of the wave form of a sound.  Machines then can look for what is essentially a number and when they find a match, take some preprogrammed action depending on the network the machine is connected to. If you were on the side of the good guys, what you would not do in this situation is offer an easy way to defeat the 1940s technology by changing the speed of the sound captured in the wild.  Unless, of course, the plan was to use speed as a countermeasure to defeat detection. And it’s not just music that is getting manipulated, it’s movies, too.  Like this illegal and monetized copy of the movie Jarhead that was easy to find using the “full movie” search term for either Jake Gyllenhaal or Jarhead: The YouTube partner is slowing down the monetized illegal copy of the movie by 25% TO DEFEAT CONTENT ID.  The YouTube partner then puts a little bubble in the beginning of the movie telling YouTubers (who know to look for such a cue) to speed it up to 125% of the upload speed to normalize the movie.   (A method that has the added benefit of defeating anything looking for running time, but that’s another story.) What is the necessary factor in making this kind of piracy work?  Easy–the YouTube viewer speed control.  A speed control that is common to editing software but is unique to YouTube among commercial user interfaces.  Why is it there?  To cater to fans of Alvin and the Chipmunks? No.  It’s there so YouTube can monetize illegal copies of music and movies. Even if the music is edited into a video that is intended to be viewed at normal speed, changing the pitch (aka “pitch bending”) may defeat Content ID if the music used is itself speeded up.  There are crude and sophisticated ways to do this, but the intent is the same. And there are dozens and dozens of “how to” videos on YouTube that tell users exactly how it’s done.  Like this one: This particular “how to” also has advice about how to defeat Google’s “copyright strike” system by always appealing a block because no one is going to sue if you send a counter notification.  Good for users, good for Google, money flows to everyone except the artist or songwriter.  A prime example of the “DMCA license” that is neither a license nor DMCA compliant, but uses counter notification as a sword. If Google were serious about piracy, they’d dump the speed control on YouTube.  They’d also police the “how to” defeat Content ID videos on YouTube.  And they’d also update the woefully inadequate repeat infringer policy. Maybe not as important as stopping Google from sharing advertising revenue with ISIS or stopping Backpage from profiting from selling children, but since Lyor brought it up….realize it’s all bullshit.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock New Google Pixel 2 leak shows raw power that comes with stock Android O Zach Epstein @zacharye May 12th, 2017 at 10:06 AM Share Tweet Once upon a time, buying a Google phone with a “pure Android” experience meant sacrificing power and performance. The company’s Nexus branded phones weren’t slouches, per se, but they could never truly compete with the cream of the crop like Samsung and Apple flagship phones. In 2016, however, that all changed. Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL were true flagship phones inside and out, featuring a sleek aluminum design and top-of-the-line specs. We all expect Google to continue the trend in 2017 when it launches the new Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL, and now we have our first real indication that will indeed be the case. Don't Miss: Google’s mysterious new Fuchsia mobile OS shown off on a smartphone for the first time We have known for some time now that Google’s next-generation Pixel 2 smartphone is codenamed “Taimen,” and now the device has been referenced online yet again. This time around, however, the source of the reference is Primate Labs. If you recognize the name, you know exactly where we’re heading with this: Geekbench 4 benchmark test results for the Pixel 2 have been spied on the Primate Labs website. As you can see above, the Pixel 2 prototype responsible for these test results was running Android O. The phone itself is powered by Qualcomm’s latest octa-core Snapdragon 835 chipset, just like the US version of Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. Also just like the S8 and S8+, the Pixel 2 appears to be a powerhouse. The phone’s single-core score of 1804 is well shy of the iPhone 7 Plus’ record, but it’s about inline with what we’ve seen from the Galaxy S8. The multi-core score is also nearly as impressive as Samsung’s Galaxy S8 scores, and we’ll remind you that the Galaxy S8 is the most powerful Android phone the world has ever seen. These benchmark scores were achieved by a Pixel 2 prototype, but it’s obviously quite likely that the phone’s performance will be roughly the same at launch. And now for the bad news: That launch isn’t expected until much later this year.

This week in search, I get into the difference between having links on spammy sites and having unnatural links - they are two different things. Google said 404 spikes in Search Console are normal. Then we discuss how Google attempts 404s but no crawl budget is used up for it and it isn’t a bad sign if Google isn’t crawling your 404s. Google explains the difference between geotargeting and hreflang. Google said agreeing with them doesn’t make you a good SEO, do question them. Google said the Search Console and the API have the same data. Google seems like they won’t release featured snippets in Search Analytics. Google won’t also do more advanced filtering there. Google said adding videos to your pages doesn’t improve the quality of your pages. Google added a feature to see upcoming events in mobile search. Google image search on mobile has a new filters user interface. Google AdWords removed the CPC cap in enhanced CPC. Google Merchant Center has an unexpected image processing errors bug. Bing Ads will stop supporting making new standard text ads soon. Google job search feature may be powered by schema. Searchmetrics US filed chapter 11 after a patent dispute.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Sign Into to Multiple Google Accounts at Once By Michael Crider on May 12th, 2017 Google has carefully designed its account system so that it can be at the center of your digital life. But if you need to use multiple Google accounts (say, if you have a personal Gmail and a work Gmail), things get tricky quickly. Fortunately, Google’s login system has been updated with this in mind, so it can take multiple accounts into, well, account. How to Sign Into a Second Google Account To begin, simply log in to your primary Google account (which is probably the Gmail address you use for your personal email). The interface was updated in May of 2017, but it’s still pretty straightforward. The sign-in page is accounts.google.com, but going to any customized Google service will allow you to log in the same way. Once you’re in, click on your account profile photo in the upper right-hand corner of the page. If you haven’t assigned a profile photo, this will be a circular icon with the first letter of your first name. From the menu that appears, click “add account.” Now you’re back in the same login page, ready to log in with your secondary account. You can use any Gmail address, or if you’re using a custom domain with Google services to manage email and other tools, you can login with your customized email address. You’re now logged in to both your primary and secondary accounts across all Google services. To switch between them without logging out, simply click your profile image again, then click the account you want to use. There’s no limit to the amount of accounts you can access simultaneously in this way. How to Access Google Services From a Secondary Account Without switching back to your primary account, go to a Google-branded website from the URL bar, like calendar.google.com. You’ll notice that Google has opened the interface from your default account, not the one you just added. The account system seems to reset you to the “default” primary mode whenever you go to a new Google site. It’s annoying, but understandable; Google is insisting that you specify your secondary account to avoid errors. To switch to your secondary account, just click your profile photo again, then select the account with which you want to view that page. The same Google page will open in a new tab, this time with your selected account active. To save yourself some time, you can open new Google services with a direct link, too. While your secondary account is active on any Google page, click the “Apps” button in the upper right-hand corner (it’s the nine-dot grid). Then click the service you want to access with your active account, like Gmail or Drive. The service will open in another new tab, with your secondary account already logged in. How to Log Out of a Secondary Account If you want to log out, just click your account picture, then “Sign out.” Easy. JOIN THE DISCUSSION Tweet Michael Crider has been covering technology on the web since 2011. His interests include folk music, football, science fiction, and salsa verde, in no particular order.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares222 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Roh_Mish Generally even I don't notice but the red to white one was a Big one. Plus all the other changes happened within a day. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups. Bill Perrotta Uh Edgar this happened a day ago. Why are posting it now? http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/06/server-side-tests-broken-google-now-play-store-users Jack Cheung You forgot what Alpha-bet(a) means ;-) James Graham Thankfully my Google Play Store got updated with a new layout.

Ugh. Thomas Dalton How much do you lose if you clear the memory? Using search history to improve results is very useful... Rabia Atta GOOGLE WOULD SURELY BREAK MY HEART!!! IT THEY DONT RELEASE NEW NEXUS 7 BY HUGO BARRA YuCMi What is the point of your services, Google, when you are pushing tests on me in the times I need them to work?

PHOTO: Kalyan Chakravarthy The data protection practices of most businesses still leave something to be desired. Washington D.C.-based Metalogix along with the Traverse City, Mich.-based Ponemon Institute published a new survey on how organizations are — or in many cases, aren't — protecting data found in file sharing and collaboration environments like SharePoint, Dropbox and other applications. While Metalogix provides of security solutions for SharePoint (among other solutions), the results should serve as a wake-up call for companies using SharePoint. "Handle with Care: Protecting Sensitive Data in Microsoft SharePoint, Collaboration Tools and File Share Applications," received responses from 1403 professionals from the US, UK and Germany who work in IT and IT security. Poor Visibility, Poor Data Practices The survey uncovered the following statistics: In the past two years, 49 percent of respondents confirmed data breaches in the SharePoint environment 79 percent didn't believe existing tools are ‘very effective’ at protecting sensitive content from accidental exposure 68 percent said they don’t have sufficient visibility into locations where sensitive data is located 59 percent said their organization isn’t very good at ensuring users interact with sensitive data in SharePoint data appropriately "SharePoint houses a vast amount of sensitive data, but organizations are not taking sufficient steps to keep it safe. The pressure to be productive is causing employees to put sensitive data at risk. Security and SharePoint professionals must understand where this content resides and how it is accessed and shared," Dr. Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder, Ponemon Institute said in a statement about the report. The report adds that 63 percent of respondents thought the best way of protecting this data was by using data loss prevention (DLP) technologies. To be most effective, respondents believe DLP tools must integrate with SharePoint, become easier to configure and reduce user frustration. Facebook, Microsoft Partner for Sales Tracking Advertisers looking to evaluate and score digital marketing initiatives more often than not depend on Excel to list and track ad performance, or at times, entire campaigns. That's fine if you are working on single accounts and single campaigns, but not so easy when you have multiple accounts across multiple channels and multiple performance metrics. Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft and Menlo Park, Calif.-based Facebook last week partnered to offer a new Excel 2016 add-in that will simplify exporting data and campaign reporting for Facebook Ads. The Facebook Ads Manager for Excel (FAME) enables advertisers to run a single report made up of data downloaded from several ad accounts. Users can even use FAME to create templates in Excel and download performance data into worksheets without any manual integration, while the refresh capabilities means those reports can be updated as soon as new data becomes available, or set for automatic updates as frequently as every 15 minutes. While this may look like a small addition to the massive range of marketing technologies already offered by both Facebook and Microsoft, it shows the determination of two unlikely partners to dethrone Google from its status as top advertising platform. According to Zenith’s quarterly Advertising Expenditure Forecasts, Alphabet/Google has increased its lead as the world’s largest media owner, with three times more advertising revenue than Facebook, which now ranks second. Overall Facebook raked in $26.9 billion in advertising revenue, second only to Google's parent company Alphabet $79.4 billion and ahead of traditional media companies like Comcast. The Facebook Ad Manager for Excel is free in the Microsoft Office Store and is compatible with Excel 2016. Google Works on Phishing Problem Google is gearing up for Google I/O, which gets underway on May 17. But that hasn’t stopped it from pushing out upgrades and fixes in the meantime. Following the recent phishing attack which affected roughly one million Gmail accounts, the company introduced a new phishing guard for the Android version of Gmail, which checks links inside messages sent to Gmail accounts. If it looks like the link is pointing to a fake page, the guard issues a warning before the user clicks. The changes are being rolled-out to G-Suite users and will require very little involvement by email administrators to incorporate the changes. Given how embarrassing — rather than damaging — the recent phishing attack was for Google, and the ever-present possibility of far more serious attacks, it would be surprising not to hear more about this at I/O next week. Lexmark Partners With Nuance In partnership news this week, Burlington, Mass.-based Nuance Communications has announced a new strategic partnership with Lexington, Ky.-based Lexmark, just a couple of weeks after Lexmark sold off its Kofax ECM interests to Thomas Bravo and Hyland. As a result of the partnership, Lexmark will sell and distribute Nuance AutoStore, Equitrac Office/Express and SafeCom worldwide. Nuance will provide service and support to customers. For Lexmark, partnering with Nuance underlines it commitment to enterprise-ready workflow solutions that enable organizations to make workflows more effective and secure. Acellion Partners With PacketZoom Finally this week, Palo Alto, Calif.-based content collaboration vendor Accellion and San Mateo, Calif.-based PacketZoom, which specializes in mobile application acceleration, have also announced a new development partnership. The companies have agreed to work together to optimize performance models when sharing and editing large files in order to enhance the performance of the Accellion kiteworks mobile application. With the growth in recent years of documents and content file sizes, files can now range from several megabytes to gigabytes in size, which creates major problems for those trying to use those files on mobile devices. As a result of the partnership, Accellion and PacketZoom are currently testing PacketZoom’s Mobile Expresslane solution, which should double download speeds for kiteworks mobile application users. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments MailChimp Gives Away Its Marketing Automation Tools 10 Digital Workplace Trends Shaping the Future of Work BloomReach, Post-Hippo Acquisition, Unveils Digital Experience Platform How to Survive When the Robots Come For Your Job How Information Architecture Improves Customer Experience OpenText Updates Release 16 with New Enhancement Pack, More News Xerox Reveals First Big Release Since Split, More News Oops: Microsoft Site Exposes Sensitive Data, More News Grab Your Seat for the SharePoint Virtual Summit, More News Google Compresses Images by 35% for Speedier Webpages, More News Useful Article?

This week, the company unveiled a special capability that lets you generate selfie stickers similar to Bitmoji from your real photos. The idea was explained in a post by Google Allo Expressions Creative Director Jennifer Daniel on the company's Research blog. The feature combines the power of neural networks with unique artwork to let you build your own sticker pack from a real selfie. When you take a photo and submit it to the sticker generator, the app will automatically generate an illustrated version of your face. It designs several customised variants equipped with effects and accessories. Once your character has been created, you can use the stickers the next time you're chatting with friends on Allo. Google said the most complex part of the system is accurately recognising your face in the photo. Because selfies are taken in a wide range of environments, the context of the photo can be unclear. This can cause an absence of markers usually relied on by AI facial recognition systems. To circumvent this issue, Google developed a new algorithm that can identify qualitative features of the face. Instead of individually coding how to respond to combinations of lighting colour, background contrast and facial features, the neural network has the freedom to consider multiple options while it's being run. Various test results have been rated by humans to improve the network's accuracy. Raters were asked to classify hairstyles that the icon on the left resembled closest. Then, once consensus was reached, Google artist Lamar Abrams drew a representation of what they had in common. Google Once the visual properties have been determined, the neural network generates a sticker by matching features of your face to the artwork it's supplied with. At this stage, inaccuracies are less of an issue. Instead, they're desired so the feature can avoid falling into the uncanny valley, the concept that a "true" human image generated by a computer could be repulsive. Google instead aims to "break the rules of representation," rather than reproduce reality. The result is a set of light-hearted, brightly-coloured stickers with exaggerated styles and typical social media props. The central face is identifiably similar to your own though, giving you a new way to communicate with your contacts. "Rather than aim to replicate a person’s appearance exactly, pursuing a lower resolution model, like emojis and stickers, allows the team to explore expressive representation by returning an image that is less about reproducing reality and more about breaking the rules of representation," Daniel explained. The chances of generating the same sticker as another user are remarkably slim. According to Google, there are over 563 quadrillion combinations of the different artwork assets created by artist Lamar Abrams. More are on the way too as Google intends to launch a new set of themes that will let you use stickers to convey a wider range of expressions. The feature is available now in the Allo app for Android devices. It will roll out to iOS users soon. The innovative use of AI gives the struggling chat client a unique feature to differentiate itself from the crowd, drawing on the customisation and sticker options popular with young users in an attempt to generate a new hit capability.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Phone has a “paw mode” easter egg Newsby John Callaham14 hours ago 11 96 18 The internet is obsessed with cats and dogs. We think the entire internet economy would collapse without a steady stream of cat memes or adorable dog videos. Google apparently is doing its part to spread the cuteness with an Easter Egg that has been discovered in the latest update to its Google Phone app for Android. See also: Best productivity apps for Android 4 days ago Android Police did one of their trademarked code teardowns on the 9.0 version of Google Phone last week, and found images of a cat and a dog paw hidden in the app. At the time, the post could not figure out why these pictures were there. Now the site is reporting it has found the secret, thanks to a tip from one of its readers, Kieron Quinn. As shown in the video above, Quinn discovered that if you dial *#*#729#*#* in the app, you enable what he calls “Paw Mode”. After that, when you get an incoming call, either a cat or dog paw will randomly pop up on the screen to show you how to answer it. Is it silly? Absolutely. Could it get really annoying after a few calls come in? It could indeed, in which case you can disable “Paw Mode” by dialing in the same code again. There’s no word as to why the Google Phone app team threw in this Easter Egg in the code for the 9.0 version but we can’t certainly can’t complain. We love cute kittys and puppies, and if they can help us out with phone calls, we would “paw-sitively” love that.

Get a secure messaging app and worry no more. Read More for iOS and Mac users. Last year Apple paved the way for a richer iMessage experience, with the introduction of iMessage apps (or extensions) in iOS 10 for iPhone and iPad users. That means you can now do a lot more than simply send text, voice, picture, and video messages. Once you’ve mastered the basics How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 With the arrival of iOS 10, Apple's Messages app received its single biggest update since its introduction. Read More , why not try out a few of the apps below? Install and Use iMessage Apps If your outgoing messages within a conversation are blue, then you’re using iMessage (if they’re green, then many of these apps won’t work). You can access iMessage apps by tapping the “>” arrow near the text input box on any iMessage conversation. From here, tap the App Store icon. You can hit the button in the bottom-left corner to access a list of available apps including the store. Hit Store to find apps by category or using the search feature in the top-left corner. You can hit Manage to turn apps on or off. Many regular apps (like Dropbox) have iMessage components, and you can enable or disable them from the Manage tab. This is especially handy for games that often include stickers you have no interest in seeing. Once an app is installed, head back to the menu and tap on it to launch it. And that’s really all there is to it! 1. Play Games This one’s pretty obvious, but there are many games that lend themselves well to the asynchronous nature of an iMessage conversation. These include favorites like Words With Friends, Four in a Row, and chess app Checkmate! ($0.99). Playing pool in iMessage belike: pic.twitter.com/tHXcKduQuG — …..

Here are nine great games you can play instead. Read More  and recommend your own in the comments below. 2. Share Your Location You can share your location easily with other iMessage users simply by tapping the i button in the top-right corner then hitting Send My Current Location. This is fine if you want to use Apple Maps Is Apple Maps a Reliable Navigator Yet? Is Apple Maps a Reliable Navigator Yet? After replacing Google's navigation, Apple Maps endured a rocky start, heaps of criticism and some very funny jokes – but has all been forgiven? Read More , but if you’d rather use a better mapping service, install Google Maps and enable the iMessage app. You can then hit Send to get an exact location fix and send a web link to the other party. 3. Send GIFs Despite the arrival of WebM video and high-speed internet, the world still loves GIFs — so why not liven up your conversations with some looping animations? Apple provides you with an app called #images for this task, which is a Bing-powered animated image search, and it does the job. If you’d like to step it up a bit, then Giphy is the best tool for the job. Don’t miss Giphy Cam either, which allows you to create your own GIFs to share with friends. 4. Go Crazy With Stickers The vast majority of iMessage apps are sticker packs, which allow you to send still images and animations to friends for a laugh. Stickers go a step further than regular old images as they can be picked up, dragged, and then placed over messages and images you’ve already sent. It’s not entirely a useful feature, but there are stickers out there that can brighten your everyday conversations. I’d recommend browsing for something that matches your taste, as there’s so much to pick from. I grabbed Apple’s Classic Mac and Microsoft’s Halo Stickers for free. Don’t miss Giphy Stickers for more animated fun or Bitmoji if you’d like to create your own sticker avatar. 5. Share Some Music Apple’s built-in Music app for iMessage lets you quickly share a song with a friend. Launch it, and you’ll find the last few songs you played, along with the currently playing item, which you can send with a tap. This will provide them with a “playable” iTunes link, which may or may not be useful depending on whether they have Apple Music or not Spotify vs. Apple Music vs. Amazon Music Unlimited: Which Is Best? Spotify vs. Apple Music vs. Amazon Music Unlimited: Which Is Best? With the introduction of Amazon Music Unlimited, this is a great time to subscribe to a music streaming services. In this article, we'll examine how Amazon's service compares to Spotify and Apple Music. Read More . If you really want to share the song that’s playing right now (in the room), then Shazam lets you do that in record time. Launch it, hit Shazam, and as soon as the song is identified a Shazam link is added to the text box. Don’t forget you can connect Shazam and Apple Music 9 Tips for a Better Apple Music Experience on iOS & OS X 9 Tips for a Better Apple Music Experience on iOS & OS X There's a lot Apple doesn't tell you about Apple Music. Here are some of the best tricks for making the most of your tunes. Read More  too. Unfortunately there’s no support in iMessage for Spotify yet. 6. Send Private or Self-Destructing Text and Media You can already hide what you’re sending in iMessage with the aid of iOS 10’s new features How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 How to Use All the New Messages Features in iOS 10 With the arrival of iOS 10, Apple's Messages app received its single biggest update since its introduction. Read More . Simply type a message or choose a photo, then 3D Touch the Send button (squeeze it quickly Everything You Can Do With 3D Touch on Your iPhone Everything You Can Do With 3D Touch on Your iPhone 3D touch is really just a fancy name for a pressure-sensitive screen, but adds a whole array of extra input options to iOS. Read More ), then choose Invisible Ink. If you’re using an iPhone 6 or similar older device, you’ll need to tap and hold the Send button instead. The recipient will need to swipe across your message to reveal its contents, handy if you don’t want someone peeking over their shoulder. If you want to take things a step further, then try out the free app Confide, which allows for self-destructing text and photo messages. The app features end-to-end encryption just like iMessage, and though there are premium options available, core functionality is 100 percent free. 7. Talk About the Weather Being British, I can talk about the weather for hours, especially living in one of the most meteorologically changeable cities in the world (Melbourne, Australia). If you want to take things a step further, you can use an iMessage-friendly weather app to quickly check and share the forecast while chatting away. The Weather Channel provides basic free forecast sharing functionality, while CARROT Weather ($3.99) is probably the funniest weather app money can buy. Don’t miss Weathershot the next time you need to brag about the weather with a selfie, or MOON if you’re a werewolf. 8. Translate Your Conversation There are a lot of translation apps on the App Store, but not all of them play nicely with iMessage. It’s also worth keeping in mind that translation and language-learning services often require a premium contribution. So the best apps for the job aren’t necessarily free. Fortunately, the best tools come with a good free option. iTranslate is great, providing unhindered access to a huge number of languages while you’re connected to the web (offline translation requires an in-app purchase). Yandex Translate is a free option with offline support, but it isn’t quite as well-designed as iTranslate. It’s a huge shame that the excellent Google Translate app for iOS doesn’t have iMessage functionality. If the company expands the app to include this functionality in the future, then it could be the only translation tool you’d ever need. 9. Find a Film Planning a trip to the cinema with a group of friends? Thinking of an older film but want to convince someone to watch it with you? Enter IMDb and its iMessage extension, which provides you with a list of films showing nearby (provided you’ve granted location access) and a searchable IMDb database right from the Messages app. Once you’ve found something, simply tap it to send an IMDb link to the film. 10. Share Files in the Cloud iCloud isn’t so great when it comes to file sharing, and that’s why there’s no iMessage app for sharing items in your iCloud Drive. But both Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive have added this functionality. If you already use either of these services, you likely already have the app installed. You can enable the iMessage extension from the Manage tab under the iMessage App Store. Once installed, each of these apps allows you to browse and share files directly to a conversation. OneDrive even allows you to open files quickly in Microsoft’s other apps, like Word and Excel. 11. Send a Quick Scan If you’re not already storing invoices and receipts digitally using a scanning app Scan & Manage Your Receipts, Save Space, Paper & Time Scan & Manage Your Receipts, Save Space, Paper & Time Paper receipts are easily lost and hard to find when you need them most. Thankfully, going digital solves both of these problems. Read More , do yourself a favor and make the switch to paperless. Owners of the premium Scanner Pro ($3.99) app can add an iMessage extension under the usual Manage tab. If you’re looking for a free iMessage-friendly scanner, give ScanBot a shot. Both of these apps handle the scanning, converting, and sending process without having to leave the Messages app. 12. Check a Math Formula Finally, if you’re a mathematics student who needs to bounce ideas of your classmates, then Vulcanize is the app for you. It allows you to convert LaTeX to beautiful mathematical formulas worthy of any printed textbook. Which iMessage Apps Do You Use? iMessage extensions may seem like a gimmick, but the right apps can really help speed up your workflow and brighten your everyday conversations. Whether you’re playing word games, sending dank memes to your friends, or saving a precious few seconds by optimizing your workflow, iMessage apps are worth a second look. Do you have any favorite iMessage apps? Let us know in the comments below.

Google is a multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. [Denis Linine / Shutterstock, Inc.]    Uber’s Legal Problems Just Got Worse After Judge Calls For Criminal Investigation Eric Lieberman Tech and Law Reporter 12:02 PM 05/12/2017      Pinterest  Reddit  LinkedIn  WhatsApp     Share         TOP A U.S. judge called for an investigation Thursday into accusations Uber’s self-driving subsidiary Otto stole trade secrets from Waymo, Google’s driverless car team. U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco referred the case to a U.S. attorney, and also declined Uber’s appeal to have the dispute dealt with in private arbitration, according to Reuters. The request shows that the legal battle over the autonomous vehicle technology is starting to heat up, much to Uber’s chagrin. Waymo originally filed the lawsuit in February, saying in general that a team of ex-Google engineers stole the company’s blueprint for the LiDAR sensor, which helps a vehicle map the environment around it — a critical component for driverless car development. “Fair competition spurs new technical innovation, but what has happened here is not fair competition,” the official lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court in San Francisco reads. “Instead, Otto and Uber have taken Waymo’s intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology.” Google specifically alleges that its former self-driving car chief, Anthony Levandowski, surreptitiously built his own company while working and making $120 million in incentives at the company. The lawsuit claims that Levandowski “downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo’s various hardware systems” roughly six weeks prior to resigning from the company and took it to the new budding enterprise, Otto. Levandowski didn’t disclose the fact that he was developing Otto, a self-driving startup, until after he received the huge payout, according to Google. Uber purchased Otto in August in a deal reportedly worth $680 million. “Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company,” Waymo wrote in an official blog post announcing the lawsuit. The case, which pits Silicon Valley giants up against one another, has been sort of a rollercoaster, especially after the name of one of the cofounders of the self-driving startup owned by Uber called Otto was mistakenly revealed. Due to an apparent clerical mistake, court documents failed to completely conceal all aspects of his identity. Levandowski also refused to testify during initial legal proceedings, asserting his Fifth Amendment rights. Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

Today, a new easter egg has been discovered in the latest version of Google’s Phone application for Android. The best gifts for Android users Google Phone 9.0 brings along some hints at Android O and upcoming features as we reported a few weeks ago, but it also brings along a pretty hilarious easter egg — “Paw Mode.” As first discovered by Android Police, this easter egg, once enabled, shows users how to answer an incoming phone call with the paw of a cat or a dog. It’s a pretty hilarious little addition the first time you see it, but it actually is a pretty good way to show novice users how to use Google’s unique answer method. To enable this on your phone, you only need to perform a couple of quick steps. First, ensure you’re running version 9.0 or later of the Google Phone application. After that, simply open the dialer and punch in  *#*#729#*#* to enable the hidden mode.

The company is now announcing changes aimed at developers to prevent future attacks. Nintendo Switch The fact that a third-party app was able to have “Google” in its title — let alone fully copying the name of an existing product — was widely seen as a major flaw. The company’s app identity guidelines already state that “app names should be unique to your application and should not copy others’.” But to better detect spoofed or misleading app identities, Google has updated its application publishing process, risk assessment systems, and user-facing consent page. For the time being, this might result in developers seeing an error message when registering new apps or modifying existing ones in the Google API Console, Firebase Console, or Apps Script editor. Additionally, there is a new review process specifically for web apps that request user data, as well as other restrictions. This enhanced risk assessment might require that some web apps undergo a manual review. During the process, users will not be able to approve permissions and will encounter an error message instead of the consent page. These initial reviews will take 3-7 business days, with Google eventually permitting earlier review requests during the development process. As a result of these two changes, the company recommends that developers review the data request guidelines and account for the delays.

Chrome Dev has a new search widget you can try out Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 8:15am PDTMay 11, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares82 Applications News Google apparently thinks you don't have enough ways to search Google on your phone. On my Pixel, I have the Google search 'pill' on the home screen, and Google Assistant if I hold down on the home button or use 'OK Google.' If you have Chrome Dev, you can use a new search widget as well. All joking aside, I can see this being useful for some people. Tapping on the widget instantly opens Chrome with the address bar highlighted, so while you can use it for basic searches, you can also use it to open websites without tapping on Chrome first. And since it uses Chrome's address bar search, it will use whatever search engine you have selected in Chrome. The widget was developed as part of an anti-trust lawsuit settlement in Russia, where Yandex claimed Google had violated local competition rules. The terms of the agreement required Google to offer a search widget that could change search engines, which will replace the standard Google search widget for Russian devices. You can try this for yourself by downloading Chrome Dev (or Canary), then dragging the new 4x1 widget to the home screen. I don't think I'll ever use it, but it's there if you want it.

Corbin Davenport Thanks for the link, I've added it to the post. Shining Wing Oh yeah, that makes sense. AP should probably revise the article to mention that it lets you use different search providers, since that's what it's really there for. King_Android Yessss, been waiting on this search feature.... F4LL0U7 This is amazing, I've been dreaming of a Google search bar on my home screen for years. Kawshik Ahmed This is created because Google promised Russian authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engine on Android homescreen via Google Chrome Search Widget. Willie Chalmers III Really? That's interesting. Who is this info from? Kawshik Ahmed It was on news every where few weeks ago Kawshik Ahmed The reason Google created this widget because after they lost the Anti Trust case, Google made a deal with Russian Authorities that they will let 3rd party Search Engines in Android Home Screen via new Google Chrome Search Widget.

This certification will be used for 360° cameras that are able to publish to Street View, and are guaranteed to support the level of quality required for Google’s 360-degree mapping service. Google are launching ‘Street View Ready’ with 20 cameras from 18 manufacturers (including GoPro, Samsung, HumanEyes, Sphericam and others) already bearing the certification. There are 4 categories of certification, based on what standards the camera in question is able to meet. Street View mobile ready is designed for cameras that can publish to Street View directly from a mobile app with no desktop needed; Auto ready is for cameras tailored for vehicle-based capture; VR ready cameras must collect geometry data as well as generating sets of connected 360 photos; and Workflow ready cameras just need to support the ability to upload to Street View accounts from their publishing tools. In his announcement on the Google blog, Street View’s product manager Charles Armstrong claims that through the Street View app, they enable anybody to “recreate a place or space and invite others in”. Their software is intended to simplify the process of uploading 360° imagery. “Whether you’re sharing your experience at a local market or on your recent vacation, publishing high-quality, interactive imagery no longer requires significant time and effort—all you have to do is get one of the cameras, download the Street View app and start creating,” Armstrong writes. The 20 cameras that have been certified are coming to market in 2017, according to Google. Many of them debuted at Google’s Street View Summit in Tokyo, Japan on May 10.

It may not be something that ordinary people would notice, but those who have an eye for detail will probably notice that they indeed look better now. And Google likes playing around with the design and all, so who knows how long this will last or if the next update will even bring a better look. Basically, the app icon of the Google Play Store has now finally gotten rid of the “suitcase” it has been carrying since forever, back when this was still known as the Android Market. Now you just have the Google Play logo on its own, and it looks so much better as it is cleaner and simpler. However, the round icon variant is still the same and as Android Police states, it looks like the logo placed on a dinner plate. The other cosmetic change is with the notification icons. The standard “tote bag” with the check mark is now gone and instead you have the checkmark on a triangle (just like the Google Play logo, but in just one color). The icon colors depend on the color of each of the content stores, like apps, books, movies etc. For the stacked updates, you will no longer see a stack of blocks but just the same triangle app icon you would see for single updates. The update to the Google Play Store is slowly rolling out to users but if you want to have it already, you can download the APK from the source link.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars GAMES The DeanBeat: What’s behind this week’s big investments in games Dean Takahashi@deantak May 12, 2017 8:00 AM Above: Herman Narula, CEO of Improbable. Image Credit: Improbable Sometimes the game industry seems small and quiet compared to a “hot” industry like artificial intelligence. Then we get a week like this one, where everything turns upside down, and I can understand why it has become a $109 billion business, according to market seer Newzoo. When the dust settles, I think we’ll find that much of the excitement leads to Asia and that we are but stones on a giant game of Go. On Wednesday, Google bought virtual reality game developer Owlchemy Labs, maker of the hilarious Job Simulator. After years of collecting a toll on games as the operator of the Google Play store, the move was Google’s first acknowledgement that it may need to become a first-party game publisher, rather than leave the game making to third-party developers. It may have been a small deal, but it’s always worth noting when a giant platform company realizes that games are important. Above: Job Simulator is a launch title on the HTC Vive. Image Credit: Owlchemy Labs Netmarble also held an initial public offering in South Korea. The pure-play mobile game publisher raised $2.3 billion and was valued at $11 billion, making it more valuable than LG Electronics. It also makes it more valuable than Take-Two Interactive (worth $6.9 billion), whose Rockstar Games label publishes Grand Theft Auto, one of the most successful game franchises of all time. Netmarble has already invested in Jam City (the Los Angeles maker of Cookie Jam) and acquired Kabam’s Vancouver office (and its big hit Marvel Contest of Champions). The company has said it is setting aside around $4 billion for acquisitions as it expands worldwide and gains a larger foothold in the West. Above: Netmarble’s Marvel Future Fight is a huge hit. Image Credit: Netmarble Netmarble has discovered what Japanese mobile game companies have also found with their advanced and rabid smartphone gamers. It can generate games like Lineage2: Revolution, which made $176 million in its first month in the domestic South Korean market alone. And it can take those profits, which boost its stock price, and then pole-vault its way to success in the global games market. It is the latest example of what I call “geographic arbitrage,” where a company can take advantage of a home market that is excited about a product category and use that enthusiasm to expand into regions where the appreciation for that category — and the valuation of companies — isn’t as crazy. And yesterday, this trend solidified even more. Pocket Gems, maker of the hit game War Dragons and the digital comic Episode, raised $90 million from Tencent, the Chinese Internet giant which is also the world’s largest game company. Tencent now holds stakes in Western companies such as Supercell (maker of Clash of Clans), Activision Blizzard (Call of Duty), Riot Games (League of Legends), Glu (Kim Kardashian: Hollywood), Epic Games (Unreal Engine), and numerous others. Tencent already has game revenues of $10.2 billion, or nearly a tenth of the entire game industry’s revenues. And it’s going to just keep on growing. Above: War Dragons Image Credit: Pocket Gems Then we had one of the most surprising deals of all. SoftBank led a $502 million investment in Improbable, the London-based maker of SpatialOS, an operating system that makes it easier for developers to use cloud computing to create giant online worlds. Improbable seemed ambitious enough on its own, as Herman Narula wants to enable the tiniest of developers to create massive online worlds that would make the Battle of the Pelennor Fields in The Lord of the Rings seem like a little skirmish. But Japan’s SoftBank has its sights on something even bigger. Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, said last year that his goal in acquiring ARM for $31 billion and setting up a $100 billion investment fund was to make the Singularity happen. That’s the day when AI becomes smarter than the collective intelligence of the human race. It might seem a bit crazy, but I can see how SpatialOS and Improbable might be a nice piece of that gigantic puzzle. Last fall, Son compared his strategy with ARM to the game of Go, where you place black or white stones on a board. If you put stones near your base, you can protect yourself in Go. But if you place stones far away, you have a better chance to win, he said. Above: Tim Sweeney at GamesBeat Summit. Image Credit: GamesBeat “Maybe 50 stones later, that is the key to success,” he said. “I do not play for 5 years. I play for 20 years or a 50 years game. So my way of doing it is with return on investment. Our is 44 percent for the last 18 years.” Tim Sweeney, CEO of Epic Games, spoke at our GamesBeat Summit 2017 event last week, and he foreshadowed that this kind of week would happen. He spent the last few weeks traveling in Asia, and he said the mobile game industry has become huge there. The games are starting to rival console games in graphical quality and revenues. He pointed to Lineage2: Revolution’s huge first month. “It’s an incredibly impressive set of games being developed there, and it marks the first time in the history of the game industry that Korean and Chinese game companies are getting substantively ahead of U.S. and European companies,” Sweeney said. “It’s a little bit scary trend that so much innovation is being driven from there.” It’s no surprise that Asian companies are behind most of these deals in the parts of the industry that will matter the most in the future. Tencent and NetEase together have more than 65 percent of the mobile game market in China. That gives them a lot of profits to expand in the rest of the world. “There are huge sets of investors there that expect to lose money for several years building VR companies and those making the future of software with the expectation that they won’t make money for five or ten years,” Sweeney said. “It’s a little worrying here that we went through this huge VR investment boom, and now we are seeing what looks like an investment bust. Within 10 years, I think the entire world will move to augmented reality hardware. We’ve got to be willing to invest.” Above: Lisa Cosmas Hanson (left) of Niko Partners moderates a panel on China’s global expansion in games. Panelists include Jazy Zhang (formerly of Giant Interactive); James Zhang, CEO of Concept Art House; and Jim Ying, senior adviser for CV Capital. Image Credit: Michael O'Donnell/VentureBeat At GamesBeat Summit, we also had a panel on China’s global expansion, moderated by Lisa Cosmas Hanson of Niko Partners. Panelists included consultant Jazy Zhang (formerly of Giant Interactive); James Zhang, CEO of Concept Art House; and Jim Ying, senior adviser for CV Capital. Each of the panelists described why China’s companies and others in Asia have such an advantage. The game companies have become much more profitable as China becomes the world’s largest game market, both for PC games and mobile games, with more than 600 million people playing digital games, Cosmas Hanson said. James Zhang said that Tencent’s King of Glory (Strike of Kings in the U.S.) is akin to League of Legends for mobile, and it has more than 10 million daily active users. Ying said that the Chinese companies have huge valuation advantages in China, where there aren’t as many places for Chinese consumers to invest their money. China’s companies can invest in overseas companies that generate profits, Ying said. The Chinese absorb those profits and report them in their quarterly results, and that drives their stock prices upward further, which enables them to acquire other companies that don’t have the same high valuations, Ying said. Jazy Zhang noted that Giant Interactive delisted itself from the public market in July 2015 in a management buyout for $3 billion. Today, its value is $18 billion, after being relisted in a reverse merger. The company now has more access to capital, and it can now use that money to invest even more, Jazy Zhang said. It is good to see Google take some action to move into VR games, perhaps as some kind of defensive measure. But it is such a baby step compared to what the Asian companies are doing. Facebook has made its investment in Oculus. But the Western companies like Apple, Microsoft, Electronic Arts, Take-Two, Activision Blizzard, and Amazon seem like they’re taking small steps. They are indeed making investments. And perhaps they can hope that the Asian companies are enmeshed in the hype cycle and are over-investing ahead of a time when the bubble will burst. But as Sweeney pointed out, I do not thing this would be a winning strategy for the West. This week should be a wake-up call for those who want to position themselves for the global game of Go.

Video Samsung Galaxy S8 vs LG G6 Camera Shootout Allo hasn’t exactly been the runaway success that Google thought it would be, but that hasn’t stopped it from adding a steady stream of upgrades and new features. But with the latest new addition, some people might want to give it a second look. With the new update rolling out to the Play Store, Google is introducing a long-rumored feature called selfie stickers. If you haven’t yet tried out Allo, stickers are central to its appeal, as Google looks to bring an Apple Messages-style whimsy to Android, adorning your conversations with everything from Star Wars to exercising avocados. But selfie stickers add even more personality. Google is using neural networks here “to analyze the pixels of an image and algorithmically determine attribute values by looking at pixel values to measure color, shape, or texture.” Translation: They actually look like you. To find the feature, start a new message with someone who has the Allo app installed and tap the emoji button in the message field. Swipe left to scroll past the default stickers and tap the overflow (three dots) menu. On the next screen, tap the smiling sticker icon at the far right of the selection window to bring up your sticker gallery. At the top of the list should be a new option to turn a selfie into stickers. If you’re not seeing it, you can side-load the APK (see link below), but unlike other installs, I also had to clear the cache (Settings>Apps>Allo>Storage>Clear Cache) and quit the app. If you’re still not seeing it, you can force stop (Settings>Apps>Allo) see if that works. Greenbot If you're wearing a hat in your selfie, Allo will think you're bald, but you can add hair later. When you tap the selfie sticker option, you’ll see a Create button. Tap that and you’ll enter a Snapchat-style selfie screen that lets you snap a photo (you can't use a prior selfie for your sticker). There are a pair of eyeglasses in the middle of the screen, so you’ll want to align your eyes with them. Once you like what you see, tap the camera button and Google’s engine will begin to work its magic. The whole process takes about five seconds, and you’ll see a fun set of disguises to pass the time. Then you’ll be taken to a new screen with your selfie-inspired stickers. From there, you can either save them to your gallery or customize your face for better accuracy. One thing to watch out for—if you’re wearing a hat in your selfie, the neural network will think you’re bald, so you’ll need to add hair in the customization panel (a turban and hijab are also options). But otherwise, the results are pretty spot-on. It even picked up my hazel eye color through my glasses. In all, 24 stickers will be created featuring your mug in a variety of situations, including your face on a slice of pizza, as a zombie, if you were an abstract art painting, and sleeping. Greenbot Once your selfie stickers are created, you can send them to anyone who uses the Allo app. They’re just as easy to use as they are to make, with the new sticker pack appearing at the top of the list when you go to use one. Just select the one that fits your mood and it will automatically send to your recipient. You can also long-press on one of the stickers to share it with Android Messages, Google Voice, or just about any other app that accepts images.  The new update to Allo is rolling out to the Play Store, but you can also side-load the Google-signed APK from APKMirror. You may need to follow the instructions above to get the selfie sticker option to appear, however. To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 146 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Elizabethmgamble Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Maxr1998 Well, you can of course just click the image to expand it to fullscreen, right? Right?! - Oh nevermind, it's Google, how could I forget. sigh.. EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. Fruity101079 Seriously, this is so stupid. Why selling big screen phones if it's to have ridiculous tiny pictures!!?? If people have blurry pictures, that's their problems. A lot of us took time to use "high res" pictures for all our contacts. And we have to deal with people who doesn't care.... >:( F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D F4LL0U7 I should probably do that too. Now that I think of it, I have no idea which version I download. Which version is it? Tiuri Elvander If you add a picture to your Allo profile, this picture shows up in the quick settings drawer. cadtek91 I have an Allo picture, but still no user picture. YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. F4LL0U7 Cool thanks, I'll try that! Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. Tiuri Elvander In your first screenshot there an option "contact to display". Surely that's what you want??? Trevor Hawk Thats a screen shot of the older version Tiuri Elvander Ah, my bad. That's very weird. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Grey That's a local profile. It's not available on the web. In the Gmail app, when I ask it to add my email to contacts, it can't see my "Your Info", and it instead looks for a contact entry. It doesn't exist. Android is 8 years old and does not have this option. Tiuri Elvander Your Google+ profile??? Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue? Exalm It seems they're getting rid of cards and shadows everywhere in favor of simple lists.Flat notifications and quick settings (Nougat), flat dialing screen, flat app drawer in Pixel Launcher, flat Play Store My Apps screen, and now flat contact page. What next? :) Cakefish I'm planning to replace my Galaxy S7 with the Pixel 2 this year because I usually prefer Google's UI, but in this case I actually prefer Samsung's contact app UI: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/55ecc6c4c968731fab76e21b370c08aeaf4c2fce79c88314a96bbbf54656503b.png Alex Rusinov How do you link / merge contacts now? Selecting multiple contacts doesn't provide an option to merge only to share. Also I can't find "link" feature anywhere, only "unlink" Zachary Dunn Cleaner? You mean they got rid of the colorful highlights and made it into another white/gray bland app. They could have scaled down the image a bit to take less space. But a full hero image looks much better than a huge gray space with a tiny avatar iamakii I'm liking this cleaner look and interface Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Anker discounts some of its highly rated Bluetooth speakers and headphones by up to 40% 2017/05/12 4:44pm PDTMay 12, 2017 2 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 20 temporarily free and 4 on-sale apps 2017/05/12 12:11pm PDTMay 12, 2017 36 [Deal Alert] T-Mobile and LG running 'buy one, get one' promo for LG G6 2017/05/12 9:51am PDTMay 12, 2017 40 [Update: Official] T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/12 8:35am PDTMay 12, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

"Security test" sent to 15 officials, advisors, others skirts the edges of CFAA. Sean Gallagher - May 12, 2017 2:25 pm UTC Enlarge / Go phishing the White House and you may need a bigger boat. Lsuff reader comments 82 Share this story Earlier this week, the team at Gizmodo's Special Projects Desk published a report on how they "phished" members of the administration and campaign teams of President Donald Trump. Gizmodo identified 15 prominent figures on Trump's team and sent e-mails to each posing as friends, family members, or associates containing a faked Google Docs link. "This was a test of how public officials in an administration whose president has been highly critical of the security failures of the DNC stand up to the sort of techniques that hackers use to penetrate networks," said John Cook, executive editor of Gizmodo's Special Projects Desk, in an e-mail conversation with Ars. Gizmodo targeted some marquee names connected to the Trump administration, including Newt Gingrich, Peter Thiel, (now-ex) FBI director James Comey, FCC chairman Ajit Pai, White House press secretary Sean Spicer, presidential advisor Sebastian Gorka, and the administration's chief policymakers for cybersecurity. The test didn't appear to prove much. Gingrich and Comey responded to the e-mail questioning its provenance. And while about half of the targeted officials may have clicked the link—eight devices' IP addresses were recorded accessing the linked test page—none entered their login credentials. The test could not determine whose devices clicked on the link. What the test did manage to do is raise the eyebrows of security experts and some legal experts. That's because despite their efforts to make it "reasonably" apparent that this was a test, Gizmodo's phishing campaign may have violated several laws, ignoring many of the restrictions usually placed on similar tests by penetration-testing and security firms. At a minimum, Gizmodo danced along the edges of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Hold my beer To violate the CFAA, Gizmodo would have to have intentionally accessed a computer without authorization or exceeded "authorized access" to obtain information from a "protected computer." The definition of "access" (and even "computer") is much broader than how most people would typically think of them under the law, so conceivably anything that returned information from a computer—a webpage with scripts that run in the computer's Web browser, for example—could be considered "access" under some circumstances. Gizmodo took some steps to stay within the law. "The system we devised for this project disclosed to the subjects that it was a Gizmodo Media Group test at every stage," said Cook. "The initial e-mail and the log-in page that the e-mail linked to both contained disclosures. We designed the log-in page so that, if a subject entered any credentials, no passwords could be viewed, accessed, intercepted, or retained in any way. We would know if they entered any characters in the password field, but not which characters. In the [test], no subjects entered any credentials." The test itself consisted of the targeted e-mail—using the name of someone each target knew, but with a return e-mail address of security.test@gizmodomedia.com. "At no point did we access any servers or data without authorization," Cook asserted. But those measures may not have been enough to protect Gizmodo from a law enforcement investigation or potential prosecution. Joshua Rosenblatt, a Baltimore-based attorney with a law-enforcement background recently spoke on the legal risks of penetration testing in a session at BSides Charm City in Baltimore (in a session entitled "I Went Phishing and I Caught a Charge"). He explained to Ars that even though Gizmodo may have not violated the letter of the law in the CFAA, "it's reasonable for the government to believe that the CFAA was violated under these circumstances." That "reasonableness" is an invitation for the government to investigate Gizmodo, Rosenblatt explained, "which is hardly to Gizmodo's benefit—[though] the government's probably not thrilled at the prospect of investigating a media outlet either." The Gizmodo test was constructed "in hopes that a top-level government official would try to hand over their Google account credentials," Rosenblatt explained. "If Gizmodo had succeeded in this, the situation would be much different. Because at that point, it looks to the government like Gizmodo was given the keys to some very sensitive information—even unclassified information can still impact security." And while Gizmodo's test was set up only to "register" individuals who had tried to log in to the test's spoofed Google login, "it would be unreasonable for the government to rely on the word of someone who just phished top-level government officials," Rosenblatt said, "especially when Gizmodo could be well-meaning but wrong—it turns out that information security is actually more complicated than tends to be expected. Who knew?" Phishing for trouble Rosenblatt explained that there were a number of key questions that would need to be asked to determine if the test had truly stayed outside of the scope of the CFAA: On the "access" and "obtaining information" side: How did they track click-throughs? Individualized websites/hyperlinks? Planting cookies? PHP/other scripts? On the "exceeding access": How was the e-mail sent? Website directed? Browser used? Did they violate any terms of service to do so? That can be a killer in certain jurisdictions. Mark Jaffe, who represented Andrew "weev" Auernheimer in his CFAA prosecution, agreed that the government could use the test as an excuse for investigation and potential prosecution. "All it took to motivate the government to bring a prosecution [against Auernheimer] was a list of e-mails published by Gizmodo's predecessor," Jaffe said. "Usually, the government prosecutes CFAA cases "because of a bad result, a bad actor, or an aggressive (usually) corporate victim," but he added, "If the government wants to get creative, it will. Unfortunately, I think the government would go after the media if it wanted to." Jaffe said that some of the elements of the Gizmodo phishing project were "consistent with the broadest interpretations of the CFAA we've seen." The use of false names in e-mail headers may have violated the terms of use of the e-mail provider, he explained. (Gizmodo hosts its e-mail with Google.) "We've seen prosecutions based on violations on terms of service, alleging [that] it's access to protected computer without access. And the circumstances of obtaining the personal information from others, using a false name, could reach the most broad interpretations under the CFAA." Jaffe said that he didn't believe that there should be criminal prosecution "as a result of this kind of experiment"—particularly since no passwords appear to have been acquired. "But I think that when prosecutors are motivated and creative, any kind of deceptive or 'bad' behavior on a computer can lead to investigations under the vague and overbroad CFAA." Rosenblatt said he believed CFAA charges were unlikely—largely because Gizmodo's phishing experiment didn't go very far. "Based on their article," he said, "it's not clear that Gizmodo could be criminally charged for a CFAA violation. But that's mostly because their phish appears to have been far less effective than they seem to have anticipated or hoped. According to them, nobody tried to sign in to the fake Google sign-in page that they set up. And so there's less of a claim that 'information' was obtained." But wait! There's more But avoiding the CFAA's statutes doesn't mean Gizmodo's test is in the clear. The second issue raised by both Jaffe and Rosenblatt is that the CFAA is only one of a host of laws at the federal, state, and local levels that could be brought to bear. Jaffe noted that while he couldn't recall any CFAA cases based solely on phishing, "there have been some federal civil actions, and states have specific anti-phishing laws." "The CFAA isn't the only computer crime out there, and the federal government isn't the only one with a vested interest in preventing phishing attacks," Rosenblatt explained. "There are a multitude of crimes at both the state and federal levels, including identity fraud, falsified e-mail headers, attempting to obtain personal information by deception, etc. And given the variety of state laws and the number of targets involved here, there's a strong probability that this unsolicited phish violated a criminal law somewhere in the country." For example, Maryland's identity fraud laws have some significant implications when it comes to phishing. The Gizmodo team acknowledged that they used deceptive means (using the names of targets' acquaintances in the "from" field of the e-mails) to obtain at least some information. One of the justifications Gizmodo gave for the legality of the test was that a "careful reader" could have known that it was a phish. "'Disclaimers for careful readers' is not how consent works," Rosenblatt said. "Walking up to someone and saying, 'phishingtargetsayswhat' is not a valid way to gain consent." For example, Rosenblatt explained, if an airline's ticket had fine print at the bottom that said the ticket was good for only half the flight—at which point passengers would be ejected from the aircraft— "an airline would have a difficult time trying to justify in court its mass-ejection policy on the basis that a 'careful reader' would have known to bring a parachute." Gizmodo also defended the test in the article by equating it to the sorts of tests done by security professionals. "The existence of boxing doesn't make it legal to punch anyone you see," Rosenblatt said. "Red-teaming without consent is like walking down the street punching people in the chest to warn them to keep their guard up. Maybe you're making a good point that will help people, but you've still 100% broken the law and can't be upset when the cops come looking for you."

As you can see from the above GIF, the new option scans your selfie then automatically builds a sticker pack based on your image. It’s like the next level of Bitmoji (which is now owned by Snap Inc.) – through Bitmoji, you create your avatar manually, but Google’s version does all the creation work for you, based on your image, which could prove a fun addition and get more people checking out what they look like in Allo-animated form.   But then again, that approach is somewhat risky – for example, people might not like the emphasis the system puts on certain aspects of their features. To ensure they’re covering for this as best they can, Google says they’ve worked with an artistic team to create illustrations representative of a wide variety of features – in fact, Google says the system has the capacity to come up with “more than 563 quadrillion combinations”. But to be safe, there’s also a set of customization tools to further enhance and refine your animated avatar if you need. It’s another attempt to put a Snapchat-like spin on their messaging tool – underlining that Snapchat influence, Google notes that they’re working on additional animations and options for their new selfie app: “Allo team is working with a range of artistic voices to help others extend their own voice. This first style that launched today speaks to your sarcastic side but the next pack might be more cute for those sincere moments. Then after that, maybe they’ll turn you into a dog.” Turning people into dogs seems like a pretty direct reference to Snapchat – on one hand, Evan Spiegel and Co have to be flattered that their innovations have the attention of two of the biggest tech companies in the world. On the other, that means they’re now competing against two of the biggest tech companies in the world, which may not be the ideal situation to grow within. At the same time, it’s difficult to know what, exactly, Google’s doing with their Allo messaging app – is this a real push to make messaging a significant part of their business, or is it just a testing ground for their photo and messaging tools? It seems more likely that Allo is a means to keep up with the Facebook’s and Snapchat’s of the world, should Google ever need to put more emphasis on such tools. Google’s obviously well-aware that messaging is on the rise, and if messaging does become an all-encompassing, multi-purpose communications channel, like Facebook hopes it will, that could, eventually, see Google lose ground in search, as more people conduct more discovery-type activity within messaging apps. Allo appears to be their way to stay connected on this front – not yet a key point of emphasis, but maybe, if they can start to push it as a more viable option than other messaging tools, or if messaging growth accelerates, it could become a more critical element. In this respect, adding in innovative visual tools like this will be key in connecting with that younger user market.   Google launched Allo back in September, and aside from cool selfie-animations, it also has a range of helpful tools, like smart replies, which can suggest on-tap responses based on your common answers, and even image recognition. Allo also includes Google Assistant, an immediate, and always available connection to Google search within your message threads, which obviously has significant potential benefits. It’ll take some pretty significant innovations to get users to switch across from their current messaging apps and over to Google Allo, though having it pre-installed on Pixel phones will no doubt help (Google has reportedly shipped around a million Pixels thus far, so not a huge influence as yet).    From a marketing perspective, the addition of Google Assistant, in itself, will be a relevant consideration if the app sees significant take-up (optimizing for assistant search), but there could also be further implications and opportunities if Google gives Allo more attention.  If you’re interested in checking it out, Allo is available for both Android and iOS.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Any selfies taken inside the Allo app can be transformed into illustrated emoji-like stickers that can be sent on to friends. Algorithms inside the app recognise facial features and automatically generate an illustrated version. Users can then tweak options to personalise their creations even further. "People today take selfies in all types of lighting conditions and poses. And while people can easily pick out and recognise qualitative features, like eye colour, regardless of the lighting condition, this is a very complex task for computers," explained Google's research team in a detailed blog post . Read More Had too much to drink? This app will stop you from doing something you might regret "In order to account for this, we explored how we could enable an algorithm to pick out qualitative features in a manner similar to the way people do, rather than the traditional approach of hand coding how to interpret every permutation of lighting condition, eye colour, etc." Interestingly, the team said it worked with illustrators who drafted what different facial features and hairstyles would look like. This was deliberately to avoid an "uncanny valley" experience where a computer produces a replica that is almost complete, but not accurate enough for comfort. "Rather than aim to replicate a person’s appearance exactly, pursuing a lower resolution model, like emojis and stickers, allows the team to explore expressive representation by returning an image that is less about reproducing reality and more about breaking the rules of representation," the team said.

In fact, because the instant messaging space has become so crowded, tech companies are looking at features like the one described above to try and differentiate their product. WhatsApp recently launched 'Status' an encrypted way of sending time-sensitive photos and GIFs to friends. The feature was likely "borrowed" from Snapchat - another app making inroads into the messaging crowd.

Forums Join   Google Fiber Loses Another Top Executive by Karl Bode Friday May 12 2017 10:00 EDT Executives continue to depart Google Fiber, helping cement the belief that the company's nationwide attempts to bring much-needed competition to the broadband market have taken a very sharp left turn. Chris Levendos, former head of the Network Deployment and Operations organization at Google Fiber, announced this week that he's taken a job at Frontier Communications. Levendos had previously spent 26 years at Verizon, before heading up Google Fiber's network planning, operations and design for the company's fiber deployments. But with Google Fiber planning a pretty obvious shift to wireless (though it's still being coy about that fact), Levendos apparently found it the right time to move on. Levendos' exodus comes on the heels of a number of other high-profile executive departures at Google Fiber. Milo Medin, a vice president at Access (already downgraded from CEO), and Dennis Kish, a wireless infrastructure veteran and president of Google Fiber, recently left the Google Fiber division -- but remained at Alphabet/Google. Those departures occurred on the heels of a reorganization at the company last fall that similarly involved a notable number of Google Fiber employees shifting to other divisions. Frustration has mounted not only because of Google Fiber's slow pace, but because the company hasn't been particularly clear about the direction of the project after last fall's shock announcement. Last fall Google Fiber announced it would be putting a number of new fiber deployments on hold as executives -- rumored to be tired of the high cost and slow pace of fiber installs -- ponder a pivot to next-generation, ultra-fast wireless. While this shake up involved laying off the CEO and shuffling around some employees, the company has continued to insist that existing deployments -- like Salt Lake City and Kansas City -- would remain unaffected. But in Kansas City many customers have seen their installations cancelled in recent months. And in markets like Charlotte and Salt Lake City, many people aren't sure if service will ever actually reach them. While some of this is due to the traditionally-slow pace of digging and installing fiber, in many of these markets there are clear signs that work has been intentionally slowed as Google ponders a wireless pivot that's simply not fully cooked yet.Google Fiber has refused to candidly acknowledge much of this, only fueling consumer frustration with a series of rosy press statements that profess continued dedication to the project -- but don't really provide any meaningful answers for what comes next. That's likely because company executives need to wait for a bevy of next-generation wireless experiments to provide meaningful answers -- before truly understanding just what kind of ISP Google Fiber will evolve into. tags: Fiber · competition · business · wireless · alternatives · bandwidth · consumers · Google · gigabit News Jump Sprint, T-Mobile Begin Merger TalksA Closer Look at Super WiFiCable Industry Poll Finds Majority Support Net Neutrality RulesWeekend Open Thread!»Google Fiber Loses Another Top ExecutiveFriday Morning Links NY Optimum Customers First in Line for Altice Fiber UpgradeDisney CEO Pretends ESPN Saw Cord Cutting ComingRanking the Best Streaming Services for Cord CuttersVerizon Wins Bidding War for Straight Path Communications----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 31 comments Anon0e91d @comcastbusiness.net Anon0e91d Anon Yesterday 10:30 am Google fiber experiment I seem to remember long ago (2010?) Google originally saying GF was ONLY going to be an experiment. Then their experiment's size and scope was much larger than most of us expected, so many thought they were lying, and speculated/assumed GF was trying to deploy fiber everywhere over the long-term. Now that they are winding down (actually modifying to include wireless) the experiment, everyone is upset. They only did what they originally said, people! I'd say their experiment was pretty successful. It proved that: 1) Relatively small deployments of competition can change the expectations of ISP's, pushing Gb speeds at sub $100/month to be the near term expectations instead of something that is thought to be too outrageous to see anytime in the next 20 years 2) Municipalities will bend over backwards and break all the long standing traditional telecom rules for something that is perceived to be something everyone wants, and it allows us to break away from the hated big few (Comcast, AT&T, etc.) 3) If you lift government regulation, get government out of the way, private companies can actually make things happen in reasonable time frames! Not sure this goal was part of their original goals to prove, but it sure seems like it was proved in this situation anyway. · actions · Yesterday 10:30 am · How about ..

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 12 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How Digital PR Pros Can Cope with Recent Google Search Updates The PR industry and SEO no longer live in two separate worlds. The 2016 Edelman Trust Barometer states that out of all the people they surveyed, over 60% trust Google rather than news outlets. A strong reason for PR pros to start concentrating more on SEO. In the advanced digital landscape and a mobile-first world, digital PR is already closely integrated with SEO. A case in point is that of Google’s algorithms, which apart from the SEO industry, also have a profound impact on the PR industry. The updates mainly affect web traffic, conversions and content, leading to SEO and PR professionals scurrying for changing their existing strategies. Google frequently changes its algorithms, and several minor updates are rolled out each year, which make their presence felt without any prior announcement. Google search algorithm updates in 2016, for example, included a number of integrated changes in order to unify mobile SEO and local SEO along with paid and organic results. More often than not, the algorithmic changes place importance on content and link quality, authenticity of sources, and the relevance and appeal of the content to the end-users. This can be attributed to the change in internet search habits and the excessive use of smartphones. For instance, 48% of consumers start mobile research with a search engine and on an average, smartphone conversions are up by 64% as compared to the average desktop conversion rates. In short, people want to get the news, views, and opinions on their fingertips. With this dynamic shift in the digital PR industry in view, here’s a list of the most recent updates brought forth by the search engine-giant and tips on coping with them: Google Penguin Launched in April 2012, Google’s Penguin update was aimed at sites which spammed search results. A lot of the websites did so by bulk link-buying or getting them via link networks. Every time a new Penguin update releases, penalized websites which remove bad/unnatural links can regain their rankings and so can websites that remove unnecessary spam. Link building, in general, has changed over the years as exemplified in this report by Google Trends, and PR professionals need to come up with different tactics to avoid being caught in spam filters. Image Source: https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=link%20building,content%20marketing&hl=en-US Actionable tip: Google has stopped notifying people regarding changes in its search algorithm since 2016. Therefore it’s essential that digital and PR teams work together and put more effort into monitoring upcoming algorithm changes. This includes tracking minor changes in keyword rankings and web traffic. Writing compelling content will always come to your rescue and so will the re=“nofollow” attribute for the links, especially in articles, blogs, guest posts, and press releases. This will prevent bad links from passing PageRank. Google Fred Update Screen: https://twitter.com/methode/status/839815982369636353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fsearchengineland.com%2Fnew-unconfirmed-google-fred-update-shakes-seo-world-270898 In the past some digital PR firms used low-quality websites to promote their client’s website to gain instant exposure and high rankings for targeted keywords. They also invested too heavily in paid media vs. earned/owned. This practice was followed by several digital PR agencies with the aim of getting their client’s link uploaded on any website hook, line and sinker. This tactic worked until Google’s Fred update arrived. Fred is a spam algorithm that works around links. The core algorithm linked to quality appeared around March 8, 2017. It was no official confirmation, but the impact of the update was felt across the SEO community. Some sites lost 50 to 60% of their Google organic traffic overnight and some reported losing up to 90% traffic. This indicated that it was a big update indeed! Actionable tip: Be careful about where you add your client’s website to avoid getting negatively affected from the backlinks generated from inferior-quality websites. Consider using a trusted distribution service like PR Newswire to reach both journalists and increase online discoverability with high ranking websites. Another practice to improve search rank is to invest time in searching for low-quality webpages to which the client’s website is linked and request website owners to remove them. Alternatively, keep a track of the backlinks on poor-quality websites with tools like Ahrefs. The free version of the tool lets you monitor up to 10 backlinks and 2 domains for each request, while the paid versions let you perform a thorough analysis of the backlink profile. AdWords Placement There’s a major shift in the way Google displays its paid ads for a particular search. AdWords Placement has come a long way, with Google restricting the number of paid ads to four at the top of the organic search results. Earlier, paid ads were displayed on the right-hand side of the organic search results and used by SEO team of digital PR company to push up certain pages in Google Search through paid option. With Google showing the door to the side ads, several firms which earlier relied heavily on Google AdWords for exposure in the SERP, were adversely affected. With the competition becoming stiff, it becomes a challenge for PR and SEO firms to come up with ways to get traction for their ads. Actionable tip: You can now add the ads as placements to the ad groups on sites that are a part of your Display Network. The ad placement can be an entire website or a sub-set of ad units within a site. The best way to go about it is to find ad placements by listing the websites where you want to advertise or search for placements that are in-sync with your client’s themes or topics. Also, the scope for ranking with low-quality ads is nil, and this is why you’ll need to work towards improving the quality score of the ads, which depends on: The Click-Through Rate (CTR) Relevance of each keyword to its ad group Quality of the landing page and its relevance Ad text relevance Historical AdWords account performance Work on getting a quality score and there’ll be no looking back when it comes to AdWords Placement. AMP Listing Image Source: https://ampbyexample.com/samples_templates/live_blog/preview/ According to recent data, the number of mobile searches have increased and toppled desktop searches. 68% of smartphone owners use their phones occasionally to follow breaking news events. And about 61% of users are unlikely to return to a mobile site which they had trouble accessing and instead, 40% of them will visit a competitor’s site. This stresses on the importance of mobile search and mobile-optimized websites adds to the importance of ranking higher in mobile search results, especially during a PR crisis when a breaking news is plastered all over the internet. As we saw with the recent United Airlines fiasco, crisis news doesn’t take time to go viral. Enter AMP. AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages is backed by Google and designed as an open standard for publishers to get pages to load quickly on mobile devices. In Feb 2016, Google officially integrated AMP listings in its mobile search results. As a result, pages using AMP coding have special places in the search results or will appear with ‘AMP’ designation. AMP enhances the user experience and works well when you want to include video, images and data-rich content on a page. Actionable tip: List all the publications that rank high in mobile or the keywords of interest. Use them to spread positive news about your firm. Also, optimize the content on your own website by using “amp tag” to speed up your website and make it rank high on mobile searches. This will push down negative results and bring positive results high in the SERP and help in crisis management. Google Fact Check Not all content that is afloat on the internet is checked for facts and yet, false news sometimes gets ranked higher in the search results. To combat this issue, Google recently rolled out a new feature, which places ‘Fact Check’ tags on the snippets of several articles in its News results. This feature extended to each and every listing in its News pages and the massive search catalog. The idea behind this is to curb the spread of fake news online, and came soon after Facebook launched its tool to stop fake news from going viral on its platform. Actionable tip: PR agencies can wage a battle against fake news by digging deep into the sources. Begin by reading more than just the headline, verify the news from additional third-party sources, see the perspective of the story, and cite trustworthy sources to lend authenticity to your stories. This can include data from a well-known research organization, studies from a reputable university, quotes from an influencer in the niche/industry, and so on. Read Mount Allison University’s Libraries and Archives fake news resources guide. The Digital and PR Evolution Google updates are not going to stop and digital evolution is never going to come to a standstill. As such, digital PR agencies have no alternative but to catch up. Be well-informed of the latest changes and make it a point to be in the know of the goings-on using the actionable tips in this post.

Taking advantage of neural networks, machine learning and the work of artists, the app will create virtual avatars personalized to match the user’s own distinct look, said the company. “Photography in the form of a selfie is a very direct form of expression. It comes with a set of rules bounded by reality,” wrote Google. “Illustration, on the other hand, empowers people to define themselves—it’s warmer and less fraught than reality.” The feature is pretty straightforward: you just snap a selfie and the app returns an automatically generated illustrated version of you. You can also customize your new sticker manually with various facial features and other options. What makes you, you? Rather than algorithmically determine the colors, shapes and textures in selfies, Google’s system takes advantage of an advanced algorithm that picks out qualitative features of one’s face in a manner similar to the way people do. “While we could have trained a large convolutional neural network from scratch to attempt to accomplish this, we wondered if there was a more efficient way to get results, since we expected that learning to interpret a face into an illustration would be a very iterative process.” Toying with its existing more general-purpose computer vision neural networks, Google found out that a few neurons in these networks were good at focusing on things they weren’t explicitly trained to look at. The company explains: By virtue of being large general-purpose neural networks, they had already figured out how to abstract away things they didn’t need. All that was left to do was to provide a much smaller number of human labeled examples to teach the classifiers to isolate out the qualities that the neural network already knew about the image. They fed the neural network illustrations created by an artistic team which captured a wide variety of facial features, such as different hairstyles, skin tones and nose shapes. Human curators then trained the network to match the right illustration to the right selfie. Google’s research team has taken special care to ensure that the illustrations cover a range of race, age, masculinity, femininity and androgyny. Furthermore, they’re working with a range of artistic voices because “it’s not enough to make an avatar that is a literal representation of yourself when there are many versions of you.” The feature began rolling out today in Allo for Android, and will come soon to Allo on iOS. The most recent update to Allo for iOS included Incognito chats for group conversations and new notification settings for selectively enabling and disabling individual notifications. Google Allo is a free download from App Store.

So parent company Google has bankrolled a study to settle the debate once and for all. Getty Images 3 Katy Perry has campaigned against YouTube and claims it allows people to steal her music The hugely popular site has kickstarted the career of thousands of vloggers, including Brit Zoella, who rakes it in just by uploading clips. But music artists like Katy Perry have campaigned against the video sharing site, claiming it allows people to pirate their songs. Google’s public policy manager Simon Morrison has hit back, writing on the company blog: “There is a lively debate about whether YouTube is good or bad for the music industry overall. 3 YouTuber Zoella has made an absolute mint using the popular video sharing site MOST READ IN TECH AND SCIENCE SOMETHING'S CLICKED Scientists say we could be chatting with DOLPHINS by 2021 thanks to software PERVERT-UAL REALITY Would you wear a virtual reality helmet during SEX?

In fact, if YouTube didn’t exist, it claims, 85 per cent of the time people spend listening to free tunes on their website would be nabbed by another “lower value” channel. 3 PewDiePie is regarded as the king of YouTube, with more than 50 million subscribers According to YouTube, its video sharing site is actually holding back pirates. If it vanished, people would spend 29 per cent more time downloading illegal material. “The cumulative effect of these findings is that YouTube has a market expansion effect, not a cannibalising one,” the report states. Google will release further research into its role in the music industry in the coming weeks. British YouTube superstar Zoella shows off her biggest ever Primark haul We pay for your stories!

Search Watch Live Home Vote 2017 UK Brexit Trump World Business Tech Entertainment Offbeat Weather Sponsored By US Attorney to consider corporate spying in Waymo vs Uber A former Google engineer is accused of stealing 14,000 documents on self-driving cars and taking them with him to Uber. 14:15, UK, Friday 12 May 2017 Image: Waymo is part of Alphabet, Google's parent company Twitter Facebook Google+ Whats App Mail By Alexander J Martin, Technology Reporter An allegation of trade secret theft, made by Google's autonomous car unit against Uber, has been referred to the US Attorney's office. Uber is being sued by Waymo, the business unit developing self-driving vehicles at Google's parent company Alphabet, over allegations of technology theft. The suit accuses former Google engineer Anthony Levandowski of stealing technology when he left the company to create a start-up called Otto, which was also building self-driving cars. Uber acquired Otto for $680m (£540m) last year, at which point Mr Levandowski began to oversee Uber's work on developing autonomous cars. He has now stepped down from that leadership role until the suit is resolved. Waymo's suit accused Uber of corporate espionage by using trade secrets which were recorded in 14,000 documents which it believes Mr Levandowski stole when he left the company. These documents particularly reference a proprietary tool called Lidar which Waymo's self-driving cars use to navigate. Uber claimed its own technology was significantly different. The case, which was being heard in San Francisco, has now been referred to the US Attorney for investigation, by District Judge William Alsup. Judge Alsup wrote: "The court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney." Waymo alleges that Uber and Mr Levandowski conspired to create the self-driving car start-up Otto so that Uber could appear to have legitimately acquired the same technology as Waymo was using. Uber denies these allegations. Mr Levandowski has refused to hand the laptop on which he is alleged to have downloaded the documents over for examination, and declined to answer questions made by Waymo. In putting the case forward to the US Attorney, the judge also denied a request by Uber which would have forced the lawsuit out of court and into arbitration. Waymo described Uber's attempt to force arbitration as a "desperate bid" to avoid dealing with the suit. "We welcome the court's decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct," the Alphabet-owned company announced in a statement. Uber stated: "We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum."

Yet, despite all the good work these sort of developments could do it’s refreshing to see the technology being applied to something a little more mundane for once.  Specifically, we’re talking about Google here, which has built a program that uses machine learning to let anyone create a customised emoji of their own face. Images courtesy: Google The tech has just been implemented in Google’s chat app, Allo. From today, whenever you pull up your list of stickers to respond to a chat, there’s an additional option that you might want to try called “Turn a selfie into stickers.” All you have to do is tap the the button and then take a selfie. Once that’s done, Google’s image recognition software maps your face and then translates it into a cartoon version of yourself using a custom-created kit.  As reported by Co.Design, Allo uses a specialized sticker kit her, created by artist Lamar Abrams, also responsible for creating the Steven Universe series on Cartoon Network. The kit has hundreds of of variations of eyes, noses, ears, and hairstyles, all drawn to best match any possible faces it’s tasked with creating. You don’t need to stick with what Allo spits out of course, once the face is generated you’re free to change any individual features you like. Reportedly, Google states the app is capable of generating at least 563 quadrillion unique faces. Select your preferred final result, and Allo then generates a set of 22 personalised stickers just for you. Of course, Google wasn’t just experimenting with making cartoons of people; their research could go a long way towards helping perfect their facial recognition software. Specifically, it could improve how machines recognise a person’s face when in different kinds of lighting scenarios and while wearing accessories like glasses. On the other hand, Allo’s custom stickers aren’t aimed at reproducing your face as accurately as possible. The Google team just decided to have fun, tweaking the program to represent all kinds of people as they want to see themselves.  Still, the implications are staggering. Google’s research could eventually lead to custom-generated faces for the digital assistants on our smartphones, computers, and IoT hubs. Imagine being able to upload an image and then have a 3D modelled face help you interact with your devices, instead of a faceless voice. Truly, the future looks fantastic.

District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco referred a civil case filed against Uber by Waymo to the U.S. Attorney's Office "for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets." It threatens to trigger a second U.S. government investigation of a company that has pushed the legal boundaries through most of its eight-year history. At stake is Uber's estimated $68 billion valuation, a possible public stock offering and the future of its self-driving car program, which its CEO has said is the key to the company's future. Waymo, a self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., sued Uber in February alleging that Uber is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own fleet of autonomous cars. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco didn't respond to requests for comment. Experts say prosecutors are likely to follow up on Alsup's order and launch an investigation. The probe, combined with other legal and image woes, will reduce Uber's value and in the worst case could threaten the San Francisco company's existence if investors leave, criminal charges bring huge fines and legal action stalls autonomous car research, the experts say. Uber wouldn't comment Friday on a possible criminal probe. Federal prosecutors already have requested information from at least two cities about use of phony software to thwart city officials looking at whether Uber was following local regulations. Alsup wrote in his order that he wasn't taking a position on whether prosecution was warranted. Alsup, 71, has gained a reputation as a no-nonsense judge since he was appointed to the bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton. The Harvard Law graduate has experience in trials involving high-profile technology companies, including a 2012 patent and copyright infringement case pitting Oracle against Google. For a judge to take such a public step, he must have more than just a whiff of criminal activity, legal experts say. Prosecutors get many tips, but rarely do they come from a judge who is familiar with evidence and the legal elements of what is a crime. "This is not some private informant that slipped an envelope under the door at midnight. This is public and it's a judge," said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. An investigation would siphon executive resources at Uber just as CEO Travis Kalanick faces many other challenges, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in white-collar crime and corporate governance. "The possibility that you could get criminally indicted would be exactly the wrong thing for Uber," Coffee said. In addition to the apparent inquiry into the software called "Greyball" to impede city inspectors, Uber still has to deal with Waymo's high-stakes espionage lawsuit. It alleges that Uber is using trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who formed his own company which was bought by Uber $680 million. After that deal, Levandowski began to oversee Uber's self-driving car division. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents with details of a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to answer most questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He recently agreed to step down as Uber's top self-driving car executive, though he still works at the company. Beyond the possible criminal cases, Kalanick in February was forced to quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders after Uber was boycotted by some customers. A female former engineer made a series of sexual harassment allegations about her boss, and a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver went viral, forcing him to concede he needs leadership help. Earlier this week, Uber suffered a huge legal setback when a European Union judge ruled that it was a transport company and could be required to get licenses and permits in the 28 EU nations. Uber had sought to persuade Alsup to send the dispute between Waymo and Levandowski to private arbitration hearings. But the judge rejected that request, meaning the case will play out in a public court, risking further image damage for Uber. Just months ago Uber was discussing what could have been the largest public stock offering in history, but its troubles now make that all but impossible, Gordon said. Uber can survive the troubles, but it has an uphill fight, said Gordon. If the court finds that Uber used Google's Lidar technology, that will slow Uber's autonomous car research, leaving it behind competitors. The company would either have to pay Alphabet to use it or buy it from a supplier, both expensive options, Gordon said. The company's strategy of fostering rapid growth by flouting laws may wind up being its undoing, Gordon said. "The empire is striking back." ____ Krisher reported from Detroit.

District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco made the referral in an order posted Thursday night. Waymo has sued Uber alleging that the ride-hailing company is using stolen Waymo technology to develop its own self-driving vehicles. Alsup is presiding over the lawsuit. "This case is referred to the United States Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation," Alsup wrote in the order. "The court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney." Neither Uber nor Waymo would comment specifically on the judge's referral Thursday night. The high-stakes corporate espionage case revolves around Waymo's allegations that Uber's work on self-driving cars has been riding on trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski.

Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing details about a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Waymo has alleged in its lawsuit that Levandowski and Uber conspired to create a sham self-driving truck startup called Otto as a prelude to a $680 million deal for Uber to buy Otto and get the desperately needed technology. After Uber bought Otto, Levandowski took over oversight of Uber's self-driving car division. He stepped down from the role earlier this month until Waymo's lawsuit is resolved. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar system is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to turn over his personal laptop or answer most other questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Also Thursday, Alsup issued a ruling on Waymo's request for an order to stop Uber's work on autonomous vehicles while the lawsuit is decided, but the ruling was temporarily sealed because it contained confidential information. A case synopsis said the judge granted part of Waymo's request but also denied part. In addition, Alsup denied Uber's request to force the high-tech corporate espionage lawsuit out of court and into arbitration. Alsup ruled that Waymo has taken Levandowski to arbitration, and a separate lawsuit was the only course available to sue Uber. In a statement, Waymo, part of Alphabet Inc., called Uber's arbitration request a "desperate bid" to avoid the court. "We welcome the court's decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct," the statement said. But Uber said it's unfortunate that Waymo can avoid an arbitration promise that it requires employees to make. "We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum." © 2017 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 Nintendo NES E3     Google's Allo Can Now Convert Your Selfies Into Custom Emojis Posted: May 12 2017, 6:32am CDT | by Sumayah Aamir, in News | Technology News   Google team worked with artist Lamar Abrams to design the features that make up more than 563 quadrillion combinations. Google’s Allo Service converts Selfies into Personalized Emojis   It so happens to be the case that Google’s Allo Chat app converts selfies into personalized emojis. This new feature uses neural networks and the artist Lamar Abrams designs to turn your selfie into a personalized emoji. If you want to show an emoji to your pals in the future, you may want to also show them how you are doing at that particular moment in time. Don't Miss: This is How to Find a Nintendo Switch in Stock Google is planning on allowing you to use such a facility to accomplish just that. Its chat app Allo will enable custom-made emojis using the face of the mobile owner as a basic unit.  This process relies on neural networks and a database of cool stuff made by artists to turn your selfie into an individualized sticker pack. This is the newest feature to arrive on the Allo chat app. Allo happened to be the first platform to showcase the Google Assistant. The art of converting selfies into emojis is not exactly child’s play. It involves a lot of computer magic via sophisticated technology. Neural networking is based on the workings of the human brain. It brings solutions to new problems via a record of the solutions applied in the past. Some of the combination of emojis and selfies gave a weird feeling to the onlookers when they saw them for the first time.  This stuff is AI-powered and not as easy as it appears in its final form. Basically your selfie will be matched with the database illustrations made by professional artists. The accuracy of matching the portraits, one real and the other fake, was where the crux of the matter lay. Color, shape and texture are also adjusted in the context of the app. The sort of complex technology that went into this setup is not to be found on the streets. It has been invented and streamlined by computer scientists and hard-working technicians to lend the best in terms of magical effects to the users.  The Allo's new feature will present some new surprises as time moves on. As for the emojis and selfies in combination, they allow you to have hours of fun rearranging everything about your face. This is indeed human technology that has entertainment value somewhere at its core. The service begins starting from today and soon enough everyone will be using it with zest and gusto. It is a naughty makeover of the 80s “Identikit” toy where you composed faces using basic deconstructed features in a large number of permutations.  This story may contain affiliate links.

Posted 11 May 2017 Ruth HollowayFeed 11up 1 comment Image credits :  Tony Smith via Flickr (CC BY 2.0) Brad Fitzpatrick, a software engineer at Google working on the Go programming language, is a life-long nerd. His father worked at Intel, so he grew up steeped in technology. He started writing software in middle school, and he has been building and working with open source software for 19 years—over half of his life. Fitzpatrick's keynote at OSCON this year was based on bits of wisdom from half a life in open source.  Don't bash other technologies. The "other" ones might have been the only choices at the time or might have been chosen because of necessary engineering tradeoffs. The cost of factoring in a new technology can be too high. Your heroes are just people. They are good at some things, and suck at others, just like you. Learn from them, but don't worship them. And remember, you could be someone's hero one day! Accepting user-generated content means you should prepare for abuse. Fitzpatrick's first website was swarmed with abuse until it had to be shut down. His second was LiveJournal, for sharing stories. Know why you're making something open source. Laziness isn't a great reason; there are other ways to collaborate that are less maintenance-intensive. Don't be afraid to write something new, rejecting "current" tools and best practices. Brad wrote memcached (a distributed memory object caching system) to solve a specific problem, and it saved LiveJournal. People derided it as "not the way things are done," but Fitzpatrick's response was: "'My site doesn't work without it, so cool opinion." (Or, "thanks for reading.") You are going to abandon projects at some point, so have a plan for passing them on to someone else. "Easy" and "quick" are not synonymous. Many things are "easy" but end up costing a lot of time, especially when you factor in long-term maintenance. Any code you put online will somehow end up in someone else's production. Make sure that trivial jokes are flagged as such. Do you find something annoying about a piece of software? Fix it. Is it just too broken? Vote with your feet. There are a lot of great choices out there, and you can always write something new. All software kind of sucks (including your own) and everything can be fixed. You're welcome to do so, but if you touched it last you might finding yourself owning it. Give talks! It makes conferences cheaper to attend and makes them scarier, in a good way. There are tons of amazing low-profile people who are worth meeting at conferences, too, many of whom will never feel comfortable giving a talk. Fitzpatrick encourages people to share their own stories and the lessons they have learned. We'd love to hear from you! Learn how to share your story with Opensource.com.

By TOM KRISHER and MICHAEL LIEDTKE AP Business Writers SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A rare order from a federal judge alerting prosecutors to possible criminal misconduct by Uber or a key executive deepens the turmoil swirling around the ride-hailing company at a time when it's grappling with other legal and image problems. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco referred a civil case filed against Uber by Waymo to the U.S. Attorney's Office "for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets." It threatens to trigger a second U.S. government investigation of a company that has pushed the legal boundaries through most of its eight-year history. At stake is Uber's estimated $68 billion valuation, a possible public stock offering and the future of its self-driving car program, which its CEO has said is the key to the company's future. Waymo, a self-driving car company owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc., sued Uber in February alleging that Uber is using stolen self-driving technology to build its own fleet of autonomous cars. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San Francisco didn't respond to requests for comment. Experts say prosecutors are likely to follow up on Alsup's order and launch an investigation. The probe, combined with other legal and image woes, will reduce Uber's value and in the worst case could threaten the San Francisco company's existence if investors leave, criminal charges bring huge fines and legal action stalls autonomous car research, the experts say. Uber wouldn't comment Friday on a possible criminal probe. Federal prosecutors already have requested information from at least two cities about use of phony software to thwart city officials looking at whether Uber was following local regulations. Alsup wrote in his order that he wasn't taking a position on whether prosecution was warranted. Alsup, 71, has gained a reputation as a no-nonsense judge since he was appointed to the bench in 1999 by President Bill Clinton. The Harvard Law graduate has experience in trials involving high-profile technology companies, including a 2012 patent and copyright infringement case pitting Oracle against Google. For a judge to take such a public step, he must have more than just a whiff of criminal activity, legal experts say. Prosecutors get many tips, but rarely do they come from a judge who is familiar with evidence and the legal elements of what is a crime. "This is not some private informant that slipped an envelope under the door at midnight. This is public and it's a judge," said Erik Gordon, a law and business professor at the University of Michigan. An investigation would siphon executive resources at Uber just as CEO Travis Kalanick faces many other challenges, said John Coffee, a Columbia University law professor who specializes in white-collar crime and corporate governance. "The possibility that you could get criminally indicted would be exactly the wrong thing for Uber," Coffee said. In addition to the apparent inquiry into the software called "Greyball" to impede city inspectors, Uber still has to deal with Waymo's high-stakes espionage lawsuit. It alleges that Uber is using trade secrets stolen by a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, who formed his own company which was bought by Uber $680 million. After that deal, Levandowski began to oversee Uber's self-driving car division. Waymo contends that before leaving Google early last year, Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents with details of a navigational tool called Lidar that robotic cars need to see what's around them. Uber has vehemently denied using Waymo's ideas, maintaining that its Lidar is radically different. Meanwhile, Levandowski has refused to answer most questions posed by Waymo's lawyers while asserting his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He recently agreed to step down as Uber's top self-driving car executive, though he still works at the company. Beyond the possible criminal cases, Kalanick in February was forced to quit President Donald Trump's council of business leaders after Uber was boycotted by some customers. A female former engineer made a series of sexual harassment allegations about her boss, and a video of Kalanick berating an Uber driver went viral, forcing him to concede he needs leadership help. Earlier this week, Uber suffered a huge legal setback when a European Union judge ruled that it was a transport company and could be required to get licenses and permits in the 28 EU nations. Uber had sought to persuade Alsup to send the dispute between Waymo and Levandowski to private arbitration hearings. But the judge rejected that request, meaning the case will play out in a public court, risking further image damage for Uber. Just months ago Uber was discussing what could have been the largest public stock offering in history, but its troubles now make that all but impossible, Gordon said. Uber can survive the troubles, but it has an uphill fight, said Gordon. If the court finds that Uber used Google's Lidar technology, that will slow Uber's autonomous car research, leaving it behind competitors. The company would either have to pay Alphabet to use it or buy it from a supplier, both expensive options, Gordon said. The company's strategy of fostering rapid growth by flouting laws may wind up being its undoing, Gordon said. "The empire is striking back." ____ Krisher reported from Detroit.

Since the release of Google’s first ever 'Made By Google' smartphones – the Google Pixel and Pixel XL – late last year, speculation about successors has been rife. The working theory is that there’ll be three phones this year, developed under the following aquatic codenames: ‘Muskie’, ‘Walleye’, and ‘Taimen'. The good news is that a device bearing the name ‘Google Taimen’ has turned up in the databases of mobile benchmarking app Geekbench. While this isn’t absolute confirmation that Google is launching a third, larger Pixel handset, it’s definitely worth noting. According to the benchmark readout, the Google Taimen phone will feature 4GB of RAM, and run on a octa-core Qualcomm processor clocked to 1.9GHz. It’s widely expected that the Google Pixel 2 will use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 835, which also has eight cores. The good news is that the benchmark readout appears to showcase respectable test results for the supposed Pixel device. Here’s the Taimen compared to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Sony Xperia XZ Premium, both of which use the Snapdragon 835. We’ve also thrown in a leaked OnePlus 5 readout for good measure: Google Taimen: Single Core: 1804 | Multi Core: 6284 Galaxy S8: Single Core: 1929 | Multi Core: 6084 Xperia XZ Premium: Single Core: 1943 | Multi Core: 5824 OnePlus 5: Single Core: 1963 | Multi Core: 6687 Unfortunately, we can’t say anything for certain until Google makes an official announcement, so take this leak with a pinch of salt.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Cars Credit: Uber Image Source: Uber Uber might face a criminal investigation for allegedly stealing Google’s self-driving car tech Chris Smith @chris_writes May 12th, 2017 at 6:50 AM Share Tweet Uber’s patent fight with Google over critical self-driving car technology just got a lot worse for the ride-sharing company. Uber looked to score an early against Google’s Waymo, but that didn’t happen. Not only was Uber denied arbitration, but the company is now in danger of facing criminal charges over the alleged theft of Waymo tech. Don't Miss: Robots can teach new skills to other robots, which is in no way terrifying Judge William Alsup, presiding over the case, denied Uber’s request for arbitration on Thursday, which means the case will go to trial. “This was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court’s jurisdiction,” Waymo said in a statement. “We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct.” The surprising part of the judge’s verdict concerns the potential federal charges that Uber might face. “This case is referred to the United States Attorney for investigation of possible theft of trade secrets based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC’s claims for trade secret misappropriation,” the judge wrote in a separate order. “Said evidentiary record is described in detail in the Court’s order, also issued today, on Waymo’s motion for provisional relief. The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney. The Clerk shall please send a copy of this order to the United States Attorney.” Waymo filed the lawsuit against Uber in February, alleging that former self-driving car tech engineer Anthony Levandowski stole 9.7GB of confidential data before departing Google and forming his own car startup. A key employee for Google’s car project, Levandowski sold his company to Uber for nearly $700 million, just six months after launching Otto.

Maybe not. One thing which can be guaranteed is that the telcos are not going anywhere; connectivity, or lack thereof, will define the next generation. Our lives are being increasing dictated by access to social media, works emails or even cat videos, and this is a trend which will not stop. The telcos will not disappear. And as far as the challengers for connectivity, they are finding out it is a much more difficult job than first perceived for two simple reasons: the workforce and the business model which is needed to make that workforce functional. Let’s take Google Fiber as an example. This was a hugely disruptive idea, which threatened to destroy the status quo of connectivity in the US for a short period of time. The potential and desire was certainly there, however Google was not able to make the business work. Perhaps the reason is as simple as this is a software company, trying to make a crack at the physical world. At WeDo Technologies’ Worldwide User Group conference this week, VP of Strategic Alliances Miguel Moreira pointed out to us that the number of field engineers at an operator could be as high as 30%. These are guys who have to get down and dirty in the real world. Google does not these people on the payroll, nor the business model to support such operations. It might not sound that complicated, but this is a business which is set up to design and manage software. The transition to the real world is complicated, and ultimately led to failure for Google Fiber. This also presents another idea. Yes, software-defined is an area which will control the greater influences of society, but that does not mean the physical world disappears. Estimates of the number of IoT devices which will be deployed over the next couple of years vary widely, but the numbers are monumental. These devices create new software-defined opportunities and business models, but there will still be need to maintain the physical conditions of the network and the devices themselves. The telcos should view their field engineer workforce as a creditable asset in the future, and a genuine value add to manage connectivity and the maintenance of devices in the field. It certainly is a different business model, but one which could be a useful earner considering the number of devices which we are actually talking about. A final point to consider is whether the role of utility is a bad thing? Speaking at the same conference, Raul Mascarenhas, Executive Committee Advisor for WeDo Technologies, pointed out that utilities are also very profitable companies. In the data centre segment, one of the most profitable areas is power supply. The money being made there should certainly not be shirked at. Elsewhere within the digital economy, AWS is one which doesn’t have an issue with utilization. Last year, we spoke to AWS’ Brendan Bouffler, who highlighted to us that considering the amount of business which there is to capitalize on, why should utilization be a bad thing? The number of customers and usecases for the cloud is seemingly endless, so why not be the stable fixture which collects consistent revenues? Mascarenhas also highlighted that the role of utility would also enable the telcos to be a bit more risk savvy. Today, the telcos are recognised as risk obverse, traditional and cautious, but a consistent and considerable revenue channel feeding the shareholders as a utility, could open up the possibility of more adventurous investments elsewhere. Think about the Google example again. The team made the decision to create a holding company, Alphabet, where the traditional search advertising business could operate as a cash cow, consistently pulling in profits, while a separate business unit could investigate other opportunities. It gives the creative engineers an opportunity to experiment with new ideas, and diversify into new markets without the pressure of the core business weighing on development. This is an idea which could be replicated in the telco industry, should operators accept that the connectivity utility model isn’t a negative. Why not create an organizational structure which collects revenues as a utility, but then have an R&D department as a separate business unit, with an increased risk appetite, hungry to diversify into new areas. It’s the fail-fast business model which clearly works at Google, but many telcos have struggled to comprehend. What is clear is that the telcos are not going anywhere. WeDo’s CMO Bernardo Lucas highlighted that there is too much trust and dependency on the sector for it to go anywhere, and this isn’t even taking into account the future connectivity demands of the connected era. But what is up for debate is the role of the telcos in the digital economy. Maybe having the cash cow model of connectivity utility, which the telcos are very well positioned to capitalize on, can offer freedom. The majority fear the relegation to the role of utility, but it doesn’t have to be the case. It entirely depends on whether you are a glass half-full or half-empty type of person.

Some of the reports suggested impressive but somewhat ludicrous eventualities, such as a flexible, bendable Galaxy S8, an entirely bezel-less display, and an on-screen fingerprint sensor. Now, although we have a clearer picture of how the upcoming gadget will look and feel like, a lot remains uncertain. That said, there’s one feature we’re pretty much sure is on the way. Reports of a new virtual assistant were merely presumptuous, but keen eyes have recently spotted Bixby in Samsung Italy’s Privacy page. Consequently, fans around the world are taking it as solid confirmation that the S8 will indeed come bundled with the new technology. An edge over the competition When Bixby arrives, it’ll be the latest in a slew of mobile assistants, all designed to interpret voice commands and respond definitively.  The timing may seem late, but some enthusiasts see it as perfect. Key players like Apple, Google, and Amazon, have already thrown their products in the field and, theoretically speaking, Samsung should have enough information about its competitors to sweep in for the prize. However, Bixby’s triumph is not going to be that easy. Amazon is signing up more developers for Alexa, Apple has touted new Siri capabilities with the upcoming iOS 11, and Google Now is set to receive updates of its own. Nonetheless, the Galaxy S8 could be the device that introduces the next best mobile virtual assistant. Here are some of the ways in which the imminent Bixby can have the edge over its rivals. 1. Being Smarter Digital assistants have been around for decades, but only the latest have what we can call artificial intelligence. Siri, Alexa, and Google Now are all powered by fascinating tech, through which they can understand the context of a sentence, rather than just identifying the words. With Bixby, however, Samsung can push the boundaries of AI even wider. In addition to more accurate voice interpretation, analysts are leaning towards the possibility that the new assistant will improve on Google Now’s strategy of employing user-approved data to tailor its activities according to the specific preferences of the smartphone owner. This approach would mean quicker responses, better prediction capabilities, and more precise search suggestions. 2. More features One of the many weaknesses that make Siri lag behind other mobile assistants is its limited functions, especially when it comes to third-party applications. But, while Google Now and Alexa have tried to implement a more comprehensive approach, there’s still a lot more to be done. For instance, everyone would love it if Bixby comes with the ability to chat with friends on Facebook, play videos from YouTube, or send snaps on SnapChat. Bixby could also work directly with other companies’ software to allow a user to interact with a company app through voice directives. It would, therefore, be able to book a restaurant reservation directly, rather than show a link to Open Table for you to do it yourself. 3. System-wide functionality If the latest speculations are factual, Bixby will be fully-integrated to the Galaxy S8’s hardware and software, opening it up to tasks like taking screenshots, changing ringtones, muting the phone, taking photos, and so on. One function we’d really want to come with Bixby, however, is the ability to fish out a picture or video from the phone’s gallery when a user describes its content. The new assistant could also feature visual search, which will allow it to recognize and process whatever is in front of the Galaxy S8’s camera and search the web based on the image data it collects. Additionally, Bixby may include technology that will use the smartphone’s vocal, visual or fingerprint recognition system to enable you to process payments directly with voice commands, rather than going into an application. 4. Not just for smartphones Samsung’s move to purchase Viv Labs, a startup AI company, last year was an indication that it’s looking to take the technology as far as it can. According to a statement made by Injong Rhee, Samsung’s chief technology officer, Samsung could use the S8 and Bixby to expand AI into its other devices, like home appliances. The tech giant may realize the bold move through a universal E-card that will house Bixby. Slotting the card into a compatible appliance – such as a fridge, microwave or dishwasher – would turn it into a smart machine, capable of receiving and processing voice instructions. Bixby could, therefore, be a simpler approach to the Internet of Things concept, which many consider the future of modern technology. Wrap Up For now, Bixby is just one of the many remarkable features that are expected set Samsung’s new flagship atop the best smartphones listed this year. But, when it launches, it could be the most advanced virtual assistant yet, and possibly usher in the next phase of mobile AI innovation.

This started back on May 9th and is still an issue a few days later. A nice percentage of products, all which meet the guidelines, are showing this error and there is nothing these merchants can do to get these products into the Google Shopping results. Feedonomics reported the issue two days ago and the issue is still there. Here is a screen shot from that blog showing the error: Google's AdWords team on Twitter confirmed the issue but has not given anyone an ETA on when it will be resolved: @Ivy__Hou Hi Ivy, our technical team is currently investigating this. We'll update you when we have more information. -Tej— Google AdWords (@adwords) May 12, 2017 Feedonomics said they expected the issue to be resolved today before 12:00 GMT, which is in 30 minutes from the time I post this.

Home > Google News > Google News > Google: Not Trying 404 Pages Isn't A Sign Of Crawl Issues Google: Not Trying 404 Pages Isn't A Sign Of Crawl Issues May 12, 2017 • 7:45 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google News & Finances Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story The other day I reported that Google Crawls 404s After Other Pages So No Crawl Budget Is Sacrificed. So I asked, somewhat in a joking way "so maybe a spike in 404s mean you have some excellent crawl budget expenditure for your site?" In any event, it seems others asked the question also where David Iwanow asked, if Google is not trying your 404s every now and then, is that a sign of a crawl issue. John Mueller from Google said no, it is not. Here are the tweets: @davidiwanow @miguelpau @davidwkelley @googlewmc no— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) May 11, 2017 So don't freak out if Google isn't trying your 404s, it isn't a bad thing. Dawn Anderson then reminded me on Twitter that John addressed this topic a year ago. In a video at around the 27 minute mark he went into this. Then at 30:49 into the video John said: Yeah, I mean usually we use this more to kind of fill up the extra capacity that we have. We say, well, we've crawled all the important URLs from this website. We know we could crawl 10,000 more URLs. So let's just double check the rest of the stuff on our list to make sure that we're not missing anything. So it's not that you'd lose anything by us not crawling those URLs or you wouldn't gain anything by us not crawling those URLs. It's essentially just our system saying, well, there's this big backlog over here that we don't really know what to do with, so let's just double check it when we have extra time. If Google has extra capacity, they will go at it. If not, not. Forum discussion at Twitter.

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 05.12.17. 05.12.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Cortana Just Got Microsoft Back in the Smartphone Game Microsoft Microsoft knows you don’t run Windows on all of your gadgets, and it no longer cares. That, above all else, was the message the company conveyed for three whole days at its Build developer conference. Redmond is no longer trying to foist phones on consumers who don’t want them. It stopped plugging its ears and pretending Google Docs and Chromebooks aren’t a threat. And it won’t beg people to throw out all of their devices and buy a dozen new ones so they can live their Best Windows Life. CEO Satya Nadella and his executives made it clear, in every way they could think of, that Microsoft finally understands how the world works. And it has a plan. That plan, broadly speaking, hinges on using Microsoft services to improve all of the devices you already use. Joe Belfiore, the remarkably coiffed head of Windows platforms, lingered over a slide that would have been unthinkable not long ago: A photo of five gadgets, only three of them running Windows, above the title “Windows PCs ❤️ All Your Devices.” He says the company designed the next version of Windows 10 to make life easier for people who use Windows computers and Android or iOS stuff—a group that includes just about everyone. The update, arriving in the fall, will let you start a document on your iPhone and finish it on your Surface Studio, or begin reading a WIRED story on your desktop at work and finish it on your Pixel at home. Copy-and-pasting will finally work on whatever OS you’re using, and you’ll be able to see everything you’ve been working on, everywhere, all at a glance. Read More David Pierce Microsoft Shows Off Its Own Super-Sensing VR Controller David Pierce Microsoft Makes Windows Play Nice With All Your Other Gadgets David Pierce The Invoke Smart Speaker Brings Microsoft’s Cortana AI to Your Living Room Tim Moynihan Alexa and Google Home Record What You Say. But What Happens to That Data? It sounds lovely, and speaks to a common frustration: Gadgets are entirely too siloed, and people spend way too much time and effort managing them. What makes this new Windows vision so compelling is it promises peace of mind, coherence, and simplicity. What makes it so genius is it finally offers Windows a way into the most important gadget you own, and the one Microsoft almost certainly isn’t a part of right now: your smartphone. Redmond put a lot of complicated tech behind this cross-platform strategy—it involves XAML and .NET and whatever the Microsoft Graph is—but wrapped it all up in a tidy bow called Cortana. Microsoft’s virtual assistant is by all accounts very good, better in some ways than Siri or Google Assistant. But it can’t compete with assistants baked into a phone. No one wants to download a third-party app when the same features are a tap of the home button away. And once you’ve started using an assistant, you have little reason to switch. So Microsoft gave Cortana a job Siri and Google Assistant can’t do. Or, rather, all the jobs they can’t do. Now, Cortana is how you access that spreadsheet you started earlier. It is how you transfer a photo from your phone to Photoshop on your laptop. It stays in the background, and pops up when you need it. Very cool, but to make sure you keep using Cortana, Microsoft made it even more helpful. Forget to finish that WIRED article (rude)? Cortana will notify you—and save your place. Sit down at your laptop, and Cortana can suggest a bunch of recent documents you might want to open. This makes Cortana a virtual assistant who anticipates your needs, which means you’re more likely to use it. And the more you use it, the more likely you are to keep using it because virtual assistants improve over time. Microsoft created some other clever ways into your smartphone, too. It bought keyboard company Swiftkey last, and is using that app to deliver a cross-device clipboard feature that lets you copy on Windows and paste on iPhone. The OneDrive app keeps all of your files in sync, and makes them available just about everywhere you might want them. And Redmond updated some developer tools (and updated others) to make it easier for everyone else to build apps on all platforms using Microsoft’s cross-platform on the back end. But Cortana’s ability to infiltrate your phone will make or break Microsoft’s unification effort. “Microsoft Graph will provide the glue between the devices,” engineer Abolade Gbadegesin said during his presentation. “Cortana will be the UI that makes it all work.” Virtual assistants are slowly taking responsibility for running your life, handling things behind the curtain so all you do is ask for what you want. The tech underpinning Cortana might soon appear in your car, or in the fancy new Harman Kardon speaker. It’s central to Microsoft’s plans for virtual and augmented reality, and central to the future of Windows. Cortana is the computer; gadgets are merely its corporeal form. Making this work poses an epic challenge. It requires a massive corps of developers integrating the new Windows features, and utilizing the back-end tech Microsoft provides—something that hasn’t gone so well before now. And Apple and Google surely have thoughts about Microsoft sneaking into some of the most tightly controlled parts of iOS and Android. But Microsoft enjoys some advantages: 500 million people already use Windows 10, and 140 million use Cortana. Most of them acutely understand the pain of using disparate and disconnected devices. If Microsoft can unify everything, it could make all those devices, all those services, feel a little more connected. It could make all your computers finally make sense. Go Back to Top.

On March 7th, she updated the post to read: Mar 7 Hello Publishers, If 60 days have passed and you didn't receive your check but are unable to select "reissue check" in your account, please fill out form for a quicker resolution and we will begin the check cancellation process. You will not receive a reply from us but we will investigate and take action if the mentioned check was not paid. Once you submit your details, the whole process should take 2-3 weeks for the earnings to be re-credited to your account. Thanks, Rachel Then this morning, Rachel wrote "While we work on fixing this issue, the whole reissue process will now take a little longer to allow our Engineers investigate the issue. You should expect to see earnings re-credited to your account in approximately 60 days once you submit your details." So another 60 days from when you flll out the form. So from 2-3 weeks to 2 months to get paid out. Something sounds weird and off. Are you impacted by this? Forum discussion at Google AdSense Help.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 146 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Elizabethmgamble Google is paying 97$ per hour!

EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. Fruity101079 Seriously, this is so stupid. Why selling big screen phones if it's to have ridiculous tiny pictures!!?? If people have blurry pictures, that's their problems. A lot of us took time to use "high res" pictures for all our contacts. And we have to deal with people who doesn't care.... >:( F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D F4LL0U7 I should probably do that too. Now that I think of it, I have no idea which version I download. Which version is it? Tiuri Elvander If you add a picture to your Allo profile, this picture shows up in the quick settings drawer. cadtek91 I have an Allo picture, but still no user picture. YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. F4LL0U7 Cool thanks, I'll try that! Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. Tiuri Elvander In your first screenshot there an option "contact to display". Surely that's what you want??? Trevor Hawk Thats a screen shot of the older version Tiuri Elvander Ah, my bad. That's very weird. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Grey That's a local profile. It's not available on the web. In the Gmail app, when I ask it to add my email to contacts, it can't see my "Your Info", and it instead looks for a contact entry. It doesn't exist. Android is 8 years old and does not have this option. Tiuri Elvander Your Google+ profile??? Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue? Exalm It seems they're getting rid of cards and shadows everywhere in favor of simple lists.Flat notifications and quick settings (Nougat), flat dialing screen, flat app drawer in Pixel Launcher, flat Play Store My Apps screen, and now flat contact page. What next? :) Cakefish I'm planning to replace my Galaxy S7 with the Pixel 2 this year because I usually prefer Google's UI, but in this case I actually prefer Samsung's contact app UI: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/55ecc6c4c968731fab76e21b370c08aeaf4c2fce79c88314a96bbbf54656503b.png Alex Rusinov How do you link / merge contacts now? Selecting multiple contacts doesn't provide an option to merge only to share. Also I can't find "link" feature anywhere, only "unlink" Zachary Dunn Cleaner? You mean they got rid of the colorful highlights and made it into another white/gray bland app. They could have scaled down the image a bit to take less space. But a full hero image looks much better than a huge gray space with a tiny avatar iamakii I'm liking this cleaner look and interface Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Anker discounts some of its highly rated Bluetooth speakers and headphones by up to 40% 2017/05/12 4:44pm PDTMay 12, 2017 2 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 20 temporarily free and 4 on-sale apps 2017/05/12 12:11pm PDTMay 12, 2017 36 [Deal Alert] T-Mobile and LG running 'buy one, get one' promo for LG G6 2017/05/12 9:51am PDTMay 12, 2017 40 [Update: Official] T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/12 8:35am PDTMay 12, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Name: Subject: Message: The state of Google’s hardware program Features Newsby Robert Triggs19 hours ago 6 285 6 Google announced a number of major hardware releases last year, from its well received Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones to a big move into the smart home market with its Google Home hub. According to CEO Sundar Pichai in a recent earnings call, “hardware sales continue to be strong,” and the company saw a notable boost to revenue in the latest quarter, reaching $24.7 billion in the first quarter of 2017. Of course, much of Google’s revenue still comes from advertising, which accounted for 86.5 percent of last quarter’s revenue. “Other revenues”, which includes hardware, cloud services, and its various Play Store, music, books and other ventures, accounted for $3 billion in revenue, up from $2.1 billion in the same quarter last year. There’s clearly been growth, but unfortunately Google hasn’t broken out the exact sales figures for its various hardware products. Even so, there have been some telltale signs that give us a glimpse into Google’s hardware performance. Pixel smartphones and Ara We all know that Google’s Pixel handset arrived to much critical acclaim and won praise numerous times for its camera quality. The phones’ higher price point than the old Nexus range was controversial for some, but the Pixel and Pixel XL are targeting the top-tier segment of the market, positioning Google directly against Apple and Samsung. So far, this strategy appears to be working, complete with huge amounts of advertising. Reports suggest that Pixel phones accounted for approximately 12 percent of US phone activations over the holiday period. In terms of figures, this puts US sales estimates in the region of 500,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016, with numbers for global sales calculated to be somewhere between 1 and 1.5 million. It’s worth noting that this was the first quarter following the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL, making this a very decent result. See also: Google Pixel XL review: a Pixel’s perspective October 27, 2016 To put this in some perspective, Samsung is anticipated to have sold some 15 million Galaxy S7 phones during its launch quarter, and Apple some 75 million plus units. Of course, we’d prefer some actual figures for a more accurate comparison, but it’s clear that the Pixel range has a long way to go before catching its competitors. Even so, this is a very promising start for a brand without any previous consumer recognition making its debut in one of the most competitive markets. Reports of limited stock availability also help to paint a picture that suggests there’s some serious demand for Google’s smartphones. Looking forward to the seemingly inevitable refresh later this year, Google has the all important carrier connections in the US, has built up a notable presence following an aggressive marketing campaign, and has also made solid expansions into a number of territories around the world. People may not have known Google as a phone maker before the Pixels, but they certainly knew Google. Now the phones are out, the Pixel line-up certainly looks to have a solid base going forward. Before leaving the topic of phones behind, we should also mention Project Ara – the now abandoned modular smartphone project being worked on by Google. Ara was axed back in September 2016 after around three years of development, delays, and changes in direction. A modular smartphone was always an ambitious project and it seems that Google couldn’t find a way to unify this idea with its other product lines. The Smart Home Another major announcement from Google in 2016 was the launch of its Google Home smart hub. According to estimates from Evercore, around half a million units shipped in 2016, making the hub pretty much as popular as the Pixel smartphone is in the US. While this isn’t a bad figure for a product that has only been on the market for a few months, Amazon’s Echo has managed to scrape out a notable advantage during its more than a year head start. For comparison, it’s estimated that there are some 7 million Amazon Echo users as of January 2017, leaving Google with a lot of catching up to do. See also: The complete list of services with Google Home support 3 weeks ago Amazon also has an advantage in terms of app integration and the range of commands available, something that Google is actively working on also. While the Google Home hardware is very good, we’re still waiting for some deeper integration before we expect Google’s ecosystem to really take off. That could very well change this year with Google Assistant being opened up to third-party developers and Google I/O right around the corner. Google’s Chromecast range is the company’s best selling product line by quite a margin. Google has been more successful in the home in other areas though, with the company’s Chromecast and Chromecast Audio selling in much greater numbers. The latest Chromecast Ultra revision brings support for 4K and HDR content streaming, ensuring that the tech stays up to date with the latest growing formats. In terms of sales, the company breached the 30 million mark and managed to sell 5 million of the little devices in just two months during 2016. This segment certainly seems to be Google’s biggest selling in-house hardware product. Google Cast compliant hardware from third party manufacturers, or ‘Chromecast Built-In’ as Google calls it, also began to appear in force last year. A variety of smart TVs, speakers and soundbars can now be found equipped with Google’s wireless streaming technology, further increasing the technology’s market share. Google certainly sees the living room and even the entire home as an important part of its strategy, as the recent launch of its $129 Wi-Fi unit seems to confirm. Google also has the OnHub router in its hardware stable. See also: Google’s mystery OS Fuchsia now has a smartphone and tablet UI 5 days ago Chromebooks and Education Chromebooks have been another success story for Google in recent years, with this range of devices helping to snag an increasingly notable share of the laptop market. Last year, shipments grew by an estimated 38 percent compared with 2015, totalling 9.4 million units for the year. For some perspective, PC shipments totalled 270 million for the year, so Chromebooks are still a very small part of the overall picture. However, analysts expect sales numbers to hit 12 million in 2018 and 17 million by 2023, despite the fact that the PC market continues to decline. Perhaps most notably, in Q1, 2016 it was reported that for the first time ever, Chromebooks outsold Apple Macs. Google is working with manufacturers on the latest batch of touchscreen and foldable tablet-style Chromebooks, and is planning to bring Android apps to more products in the range. Unfortunately, Android app support currently remains in beta form and is proving to be very slow to arrive. However, adding Android app support to many existing Chromebooks is going to be a core part of Google’s Chromebook strategy going forward bringing extra functionality to consumers and undoubtedly attracting even more. It hasn’t all been smooth sailing for Chromebooks though, with Google’s own Chromebook hardware, the Pixel range, appearing to not perform as well as third party models. In August 2016, Google announced that it wouldn’t be restocking it’s expensive Chromebook Pixel 2, after the $999 model had already been discontinued. The immediate assumption is that the Chromebook Pixel 2 simply isn’t selling in enough numbers to warrant another run off the production line. Criticism that at $1000 to $1300 customers can get more features for their money from a Windows laptop or Mac are certainly warranted, and it seems clear that the range just doesn’t have the same impact at the premium tier. As we’ve seen over the past two years though, Chromebooks have been solidifying their position in the education sector. Throughout 2016, Chromebooks accounted for 58 percent of the 12.6 million devices shipped to US primary and secondary schools. Meanwhile shipments of iPads and Mac laptops bell to 19 percent from around 25 percent and Microsoft products actually overtook Apple.

Combined with the cloud based nature of its office suite and a selection of dedicated education tools, we can see why these devices have proven so popular. Low cost Chromebooks have become a big winner for Google, in both the consumer and education markets, and they certainly aren’t going anywhere. Once Android apps are officially delivered en masse, expect a renewed surge in Chromebook interest and an even stronger product portfolio to come. Wrap Up Google likes to cast a wide net and it’s clear that some of its hardware initiatives have worked out better than others. Going back to figures temporarily, Google’s “Other Bets” category of ventures, which includes self-driving cars and the company’s X Labs projects, continues to make a loss. This totalled $855 million in the first quarter of 2017, up from the $744 million it lost during the same period last year. Still, the company’s core product ranges – smartphones, home products, and Chromebooks – appear to be performing quite strongly. Of course, Google has a lot of software initiatives too, some of which have also been more successful than others. See Google Allo, Duo, and Android Wear 2.0. Interestingly, looking forward, Pichai claims that Google is “transitioning to an AI-first company” and so we’ll likely see an even bigger focus on Google Assistant software across hardware devices over the coming year. We’ll probably hear much more about artificial intelligence, and perhaps some new hardware initiatives, at the company’s upcoming Google I/O 2017 event.

WTF, NYT? 41 Business All that free music on YouTube is good for you, Google tells music biz Lucky duckies 12 May 2017 at 11:14, Andrew Orlowski Google wants you to believe that free music on YouTube doesn't deter people from paying for the same music somewhere else. Pull the other one, it's got bells on, the music industry has replied. Google commissioned RBB Economics to produce a report, which we've seen in full, examining the effect of cannibalisation on paid music services. YouTube benefits from exploiting an amazingly fortuitous loophole in copyright law, something not available to rivals like Spotify and Apple. It's a special protection for a class of material misleadingly called "user-generated content". The phrase was originally intended to cover things like your personal files on cloud storage services, but in 2017 it means individuals uploading other people's music, so a more accurate term might "user-uploaded content" – they haven't generated anything. This gives YouTube an unrivalled catalogue – it's really the world's default jukebox – without having to negotiate for licenses, and Google gives this away for free*. Spotify, Apple and everyone else who can't take advantage of the UGC loophole must sit down and negotiate a license for music. Here Google has an advantage because of the asymmetric power of the takedown regime. They can rest assured that when it eventually gets round to taking down unlicensed uploads, they'll pop up in no time. We described it using an analogy here. (For this you need to put yourself in a music producer or distributor's shoes – although this maybe too much for some readers lacking empathy or imagination. Give it a try, though.) The music industry argues that all this free stuff depresses the market price of music – and it's hard to see how it can't. But not so fast, says Google, and commissioned RBB to prove otherwise. RBB did two things. It looked at the performance on paid streaming services of some songs that had been removed from YouTube and also ran some polls. RBB conclude that cannibalisation is "unlikely", but its own figures suggest that the most valuable YouTube users would in fact move up to a paid service if the music they wanted wasn't available for free on YouTube. So how did RBB arrive at its conclusion? In two ways. RBB reckons 85 per cent of YouTube's audience would shift to "lower or similar value channels", half of which would be non-music. For those who wanted free music, 28 per cent would opt for piracy. You can see that makes sense. YouTube is the default setting for teenagers, many of whom are not valuable music customers – yet – but may be some day. But RBB notes this is problematic, as respondents said the average time spent listening to pirate music was just 20 minutes a month. "The possibility that respondents misreported their usage of pirated content cannot be ruled out," a footnote tells us, casting doubt on the other responses. But even 15 per cent, trade group the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) responds, is worth a lot to the industry. "RBB's data shows that 19 per cent of YouTube usage in the UK would divert on to higher value platforms, such as paid subscription services. If that usage were evenly distributed among YouTube's users and 19 per cent of YouTube users chose to take out a music subscription, it would generate approximately £415 million per annum additional retail spend on music – doubling the current value of the UK streaming market," argues BPI chief executive Geoff Taylor. Even if only half of the 15 per cent number switched to paid, Taylor says it would make a big difference because the paid streaming market is so small compared to the YouTube juggernaut. "This patently unfair distortion in the digital content market must be fixed once and for all, and we again call on the UK Government and on EU policymakers to clarify that online platforms must secure fair arms-length licences for the content that they commercially exploit," Taylor added. RBB also devotes some pages to examining whether revenues derived by a song blocked on YouTube increase. It concludes they don't. But given that blocking a song is effectively impossible, thanks to the UGC loophole, maybe that isn't surprising. ® Bootnote *YouTube launched its controversial tenner-a-month service Red in the USA in late 2015, but it has yet to come to the UK. The Play Music service for 'Droids has run for years, without making much of a dent on the overall market.

As the smart home comes to a building complex near you, here’s what you should know about the living experience Subscribe to our newsletter. Vishal Mathur Every tech giant you can think of—Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Philips, Honeywell—and some start-ups are investing heavily in enhancing their IoT product offerings. You’ve left home, but you cannot get rid of that nagging feeling that you forgot to switch off the air conditioner. Or maybe you would like to check up on your pet dog. With smart gadgets in a smart home, you will be able to monitor what’s happening inside the house and switch gadgets on or off—all through your smartphone, and from anywhere in the world. George Jetson’s futuristic 2062 home in the animated television series The Jetsons is now well and truly here. More than a concept now The terms “smart home”, “connected home” and “Internet of Things (IoT)” are all pretty much part of the same ecosystem: You have a home that has basics such as lighting, air conditioning, security as well as additional gadgets, and devices that are connected to the Internet. These can be remote controlled from your smartphone. And it shouldn’t cost you an arm and a leg either. The good news? Your existing home can be converted into a smart home. The big advantages are convenience, savings in money and energy, the facility of monitoring and the flexibility of customizing performance and settings. Sales of smart home devices are expected to hit $1.4 billion (about Rs8,960 crore) by 2021, a 500% increase from the $90 million recorded in 2016, according to research firm Ovum. “The security aspect of our homes has evolved with digital gadgets and having an interactive home not only adds a tinge of panache and style but also accentuates our city-paced lifestyle,” says Rahul Shah, chief executive officer, Sumer Group, a real-estate developer. Also read: Is the future of living smart? The Internet of many things Every tech giant you can think of—Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, Philips, Honeywell—and some start-ups are investing heavily in enhancing their IoT product offerings. IoT just refers to the interconnection of the everyday gadgets in your home to your smartphone, via the Internet. The premise, as with any other gadget, is to enhance affordability. Research by BI Intelligence, a research service from Business Insider, suggests that by 2021, investment in IoT will be as high as $4.8 trillion, with companies keen to make fuse of the first-mover advantage. In February, Chinese Web services company Baidu completed the acquisition of a start-up called Raven Tech. One of the largest tech companies in the world, Baidu wasn’t going to be left behind in the connected home ecosystem space. With this acquisition, it now has the Mandarin-language answer to Amazon’s Echo and Apple’s Siri virtual assistants. And at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas earlier this year, Samsung announced that its smart fridge can now understand voice commands—you can ask about the weather, manage to-do-lists and calendar schedules. Smartness is more than fancy lighting There is more to a smart home than remote-controlled gadgets. “Smart technology includes CCTV monitoring, siren systems, alarm systems, infrared intrusion detection, video-door-phone, motion sensors, security keypad, biometric scans, smoke/fire detectors, anti-shattering windows and wireless communication systems,” says Mudhit Gupta, chairman and managing director of EMGEE Group, a realtor. They have smart home properties in Goa, such as the Naira designer villas. Fire and gas-leak detection systems are now being integrated into smart homes. Then there is the issue of energy-efficiency monitoring—used by many commercial buildings for some time now, which is still a new concept for homes. “This is also coupled with movement and presence detectors which can be used to economize electrical energy consumption,” says Rajeeb Dash, head-corporate marketing, Tata Housing. They have multiple smart-home projects, including Myst in Kasauli and Prive in Lonavala. Smart-home security control at Sotheby’s Caitriona penthouse in Gurugram. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint. Diversity in smartness Most new smart homes are deploying a centralized hub to which the connected gadgets are paired; you can control the functionality of each and receive status updates from the hub. “Having a smart home full of intelligent gadgets like smart lighting, ACs, TVs, music systems, security cameras adds to the fun as well as comfort of an individual. However, controlling all the technology from individual apps/gadgets becomes a hassle; therefore, a hub-based model was introduced,” says Amit Goyal, chief executive officer, India Sotheby’s International Realty. Their smart-home properties include Express Exclusive in Chennai and Caitriona Penthouse in Gurugram near Delhi, where they have a master hub unit for controlling the home’s smart features, with an iPad control centre in each room. This year should see agreement on industry standards for interconnectivity of IoT gadgets. Research firm Gartner predicts that “organizations creating products may have to develop variants to support multiple standards or ecosystems and be prepared to update products during their lifespan as the standards evolve and new standards and related APIs (application programming interfaces) emerge”. There is hope that Google’s Android Things platform, which already supports many IoT gadgets made by third parties, could usher in that critical evolution—rival platforms may be forced into becoming more flexible. We may already be witnessing the winds of change. Honeywell, for instance, updated the Lyric smart-home platform in February and expanded support for the “Works with Honeywell” feature. If users have the “Works With Honeywell” stamp they will be able to add IoT gadgets from other brands to their existing Lyric set-ups—it also works with the Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings and IFTTT platforms, which is the sort of flexibility that will make smart gadgets even more relevant. The security fear Security remains a big concern for IoT gadgets. In February, AT&T, IBM, Nokia, Palo Alto Networks, Symantec and Trustonic joined hands to form the IoT Cybersecurity Alliance to tackle the security issues that are expected to crop up as IoT becomes popular. AT&T reports that in the past three years, there has been a 3,198% increase in attackers scanning for vulnerabilities in IoT devices. Gartner suggests that as many as 8.4 billion connected “things” will be in use worldwide this year—everything from connected coffee makers to connected cars; up 31% from 2016, while the total number is expected to touch 20.4 billion by 2020. And this is exactly where Finnish Internet security firm F-Secure’s Sense wireless router ($199) becomes relevant for your smart- home dreams—it is focused on securing your gadgets and home network against malware. *** Get smart Some real-estate projects that carry the ‘smart’ tag ■North India Sotheby’s International Realty’s penthouses at Caitriona Apartments in Gurugram have a multi-room music system, and a tablet in each room with controls for lights, fans and curtains, for example. ■Tata Housing’s Prive residences in Lonavala have smart air conditioning, a panic button, and gas plus heat sensors in kitchens. ■In Vaishali and Greater Noida, realty firm Dasnac’s Designarch e-homes have smart lighting and security that can be controlled through a touchscreen control panel, and also from your phone. ■The Lodha Group’s properties in Mumbai, Pune and Hyderabad, including the Bellezza, have Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) security, motion sensors, and Wi-Fi enabled homes. ■Ireo’s Skyon in Gurugram offer mood lighting in rooms, automated curtain controls, preset times for appliances such as geysers, centralized air conditioning (also known as VRV air conditioning) that can be kept active in the rooms that happen to be in use. You also get remote door unlock as well as gas and fire alarms. *** Click here for enlarge How to include some smart-tech in your existing home Fixes for lighting, air purifying, and to turn existing appliances into smart gadgets You might have envisioned a future where you could just talk to an unassuming gadget on the kitchen counter, and ask it questions like “Who was Nicolae Ceaușescu?”, and get an immediate answer. That is what smart personal assistants such as Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Home do. From smart lights, smart plugs that allow you to control just about any gadget remotely, or IoT connected devices, there is a lot you can buy to upgrade your home. Here are a few picks. Smart lighting: Philips Hue lighting (Rs16,995 for the Starter Kit) consists of smart bulbs for existing light fixtures and connects them to a hub device which is hooked to your Internet, and all this can be controlled through your smartphone—illumination level, colour, notification blink in case you get a new message on your phone, and a lot more. You can switch on or off the lights in your home from anywhere in the world. Clean air: These indoor air purifiers can be managed from your smartphone. The most affordable is the Xiaomi Mi Purifier 2 (Rs9,999), followed by the Blueair Sense+ (Rs42,499) and Honeywell’s Air Touch-S (Rs39,990). You’ll even get notifications on your phone whenever the filters need cleaning. Make everything IoT: Indian start-up Beyond Evolution’s Betty Smart plug (Rs2,499) is an unassuming device that can convert any existing electrical appliance into a smart gadget. This plug pairs with your phone and you can share “appliance control” between family members too, so that any member can switch it on or off. It has a built-in GSM module to connect to a mobile network. You can monitor energy-consumption statistics, remotely switch on or off any connected gadgets and electrical appliances, set a schedule and receive notifications which will indicate any status change. How amazing would it be if you are able to switch on the AC before reaching home after a long day at work, or turn on the geyser in the morning without getting out of bed?

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 12/05/2017: A US judge has called for an immediate investigation into the allegations of stolen trade secrets, which have surfaced during a court battle between Uber and Google over self-driving car technology. Google initially filed a lawsuit against the ride-hailing app in February, which alleged that former engineer Anthony Levandowksi downloaded 14,000 files without authorisation while working on its self-driving car research. Levandowski is said to have then left Google's Waymo to found his own startup, Otto, which was then later purchased by Uber for $680 million. Google claims that the documents travelled with him, which Uber then used to fast track its own autonomous vehicle research. US District Judge William Alsup stated in a ruling that the case "contains ample evidence" to merit an investigation, and has forwarded a recommendation to the US attorney "based on the evidentiary record supplied thus far concerning plaintiff Waymo LLC's claims for trade secret misappropriation". "The Court takes no position on whether a prosecution is or is not warranted, a decision entirely up to the United States Attorney," the order states. Alsup also partially granted Google's bid to force an injunction against Uber's self-driving car unit, which if successful could determine the future of the company's operations in the technology. This ruling, which could be decided as early as tomorrow, has been made under temporary seal, so the exact scope of the injunction is unclear. The case has been complicated somewhat by Levandowski, who has invoked his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination and refuses to testify, leaving the two companies to fight it out in court. A spokesperson for Uber said in an email to IT Pro: "It is unfortunate that Waymo will be permitted to avoid abiding by the arbitration promise it requires its employees to make. We remain confident in our case and welcome the chance to talk about our independently developed technology in any forum". The company also said it would not be commenting on the case referral to the US Attorney, but stated that the result of the partial preliminary injunction, currently under seal, would most likely be "status quo". Uber initially argued that Waymo's trade secret allegations should be held in private arbitration, however because Levandowski is not a defendant, Uber could not use his arbitration agreement with Waymo to force the proceedings behind closed doors, and as such was rejected by the judge. Uber doesn't dispute the claim that Levandowski stole the documents in question, but argues that trade secrets never made their way into the company's research, and that Google needs to prove that Uber "derived its knowledge from Levandowski". 28/04/2017: Uber self-driving car boss steps down amid Waymo lawsuit Uber's self-driving car chief has left his position after allegations that he stole critical research from his former employers at Waymo, Alphabet's own driverless car unit. Anthony Levandowski will continue to work for Uber, according to an internal memo published by Business Insider, but will no longer head up the company's Advanced Technologies Group or manage its work on autonomous vehicles. "Travis and I have decided that I will be recused from all LiDAR-related work and management at Uber, through the remainder of the Waymo litigation," Levandowski wrote in an email to staff. "This change means that Eric Meyhofer will be the head of ATG, reporting to Travis, and I will report to Eric. My other responsibilities will not change." "This organizational change means I will have absolutely no oversight over or input into our LiDAR work. Going forward, please make sure not to include me in meetings or email threads related to LiDAR, or ask me for advice on the topic." Levandowski's departure comes amid allegations from his former employers, Waymo. The Alphabet-owned self-driving car company claims that when he left to join Uber, Levandowski took vital technology and information on the company's research and development efforts with him. For Uber's part, it claims that its work is "fundamentally different" to Waymo's and that Levandowski's role was focused on management rather than engineering. As part of the ongoing case, the presiding judge has asked the company to provide details of Levandowski's role, which could result in an injunction stopping Lewandowski from working on Uber's autonomous vehicle programme altogether. Uber declined to comment, but referred IT Pro to the email published by Business Insider. 26/04/2017: Leading US carmakers have petitioned the state of California to revise its proposed regulations on autonomous vehicle testing, stating that authorities ignored their earlier concerns that the rules would become too restrictive. Self-driving car manufacturers raised their objections at a public hearing in Sacramento on Tuesday, the recording of which was seen by Reuters, saying that the planned additional regulations should be dropped, and that oversight should be handed to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) instead. In the consultation, hosted via a webcast, automaker groups including the Association of Global Automakers described the proposed regulations as going "too far". The group also opposes California's plans to introduce a permit system, which would be required by all automakers wishing to test self-driving cars in the state. Ride-hailing firm Uber was driven out of San Francisco last year after it refused to apply for a permit to test its autonomous vehicle fleet. Automakers now believe requiring a permit is no longer an effective approach to regulating tests, and object to the proposal that the state could revoke permissions even if a company adheres to federal requirements. If the proposals were to be accepted, the automakers would be liable for any crashes that occur during the tests, even if they were not to blame. General Motors official Paul Hemmersbaugh said that regulations like these could have a "chilling effect on testing and deployment of self-driving cars". It could also see the introduction of a scheme that would ask automakers to submit a voluntary assessment to the NHTSA, outlining specific details of their self-driving vehicle systems. However, according to lawyers representing Google, Ford, and Uber, this would effectively be a mandatory clause. Other self-driving manufacturers, including Alphabet's Waymo and Ford, asked California to relax current regulations that restrict the testing of vehicles weighing more than 10,000 pounds, which would include rides with multiple passengers. However safety advocates believe harsher regulations would ensure the public is kept safe from potential accidents. Group president for the Consumers for Auto Reliability, Rosemary Shahan, said: "We do not trust the auto manufacturers or the tech industry to protect the public in the absence of federal motors vehicle safety standards." Alphabet's Ron Medford urged the state to quickly issue definitive guidelines "to provide manufacturers with the certainty that they need", although it is clear that lawmakers are still unsure how best to regulate the emerging technology. 24/04/2017: UK tech firms today received funding to test self-driving cars on Britain's roads, reaping the benefits of a recent government pledge to back the development of emerging technologies. Two consortiums have already secured backing as part of the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund, a government commitment announced on Friday set to invest almost £5 billion into research and development over the next four years. Streetwise, a group led by Cambridge-based AI startup firm FiveAI, is currently working on a trial that will allow commuters to order self-driving cars using a mobile app. This will include the development of new insurance and safety protocols governing the use of the technology. The trial, which is set to launch in 2019, has received £12.8 million in government support and will be developed with input from Direct Line, Transport for London, the Transport Research Laboratory, and the University of Oxford. "It's about delivering to the consumer an autonomous Uber-type service in London," said FiveAI CEO Stan Boland, speaking to the Telegraph. "It's insane for people to buy a car and the leave it parked for 94% of the time and only have one user per car, in the future vehicles can be shared." Driverless shuttle tests are already underway in Greenwich Driven, an initiative led by Oxbotica that has received £8.6 million in government funding, aims to develop self-driving technology over the course of a 30-month programme that started in April, aimed at linking London and Oxford with an autonomous shuttle. Commuters are able to test the technology today on the streets of Greenwich. Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith said: "Today’s news is truly ground-breaking. No company, group or consortium of autonomy experts has ever attempted what DRIVEN is planning over the next 30-months.We are seeking to address some of the most fundamental challenges preventing the future commercial deployment of fully autonomous vehicles. I have full confidence in Driven’s world-leading and internationally respected team of specialists to deliver this project." Telefonica, the UK Atomic Energy Authority's R&D lab Race, UK domain registry firm Nominet, Oxford Robotics Institute, and Oxfordshire Council, will join Oxbotica in the consortium, as well as the Transport Research Laboratory, which is also supporting FiveAI. The Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund is the latest government initiative to foster development of some emerging technology innovations, and offer alternate ways for commuters to travel to and from the capital. Speaking alongside the announcement, business and energy secretary Greg Clark said: "As part of our Plan for Britain this government wants to create a modern Industrial Strategy to support the key sectors of our economy and spread jobs, prosperity and opportunity around the whole country." "The funding I am announcing today, providing hundreds of millions of pounds of support to develop the next generation of technologies across a range of sectors, shows our determination and commitment to making sure the UK remains at the very forefront of research and innovation." Picture courtesy of The Gateway Project 19/04/2017: Baidu to open its autonomous driving platform Chinese tech giant Baidu has announced it's to provide an open software platform beginning in July for the automotive and autonomous driving industry to help develop autonomous driving systems. Baidu stated it wants to "build a collaborative ecosystem, utilising its strengths in artificial intelligence (AI) technology to work together with other companies to promote the development and popularisation of autonomous driving technology". The initiative has been named Project Apollo after the US' lunar landing programme, as the company believes autonomous driving has the same potential to change the world as its namesake did. Apollo will include a vehicle platform, hardware platform, software platform and cloud data services. The company is planning to open source obstacle perception code and capabilities, trajectory planning, vehicle control, and vehicle operating systems, as well as testing tools. Baidu President and CEO Qi Lu said: "AI has great potential to drive social development, and one of AI's biggest opportunities is intelligent vehicles." The company is also going to set up  alliances with partners "who will provide the best and most compatible vehicles, sensors, and other components, to achieve broad participation and collaboration and to provide references and recommendations to participants of a rapidly expanding ecosystem enabled by Project Apollo". It hopes that this will make it easier and more efficient to research and develop self driving car technology. Baidu will restrictively open its technology in July and then open it fully towards the end of the year. It also plans to introduce fully autonomous driving capabilities on highways and open city roads by 2020. 05/04/2017: A recent disengagement report from Alphabet's Waymo shows that the company's driverless cars are some of the most reliable in the self-driving industry. According to the report, Waymo's autonomous vehicles drove 635,868 cumulative miles over the past year and had 124 disengagements, which are defined as instances where a human needed to take over driving. This means that these vehicles only experienced roughly one disengagement every 5,128 miles. When compared to the competition, results indicated that Waymo's vehicles are significantly more reliable at this point. While Ford only reported three disengagements over the past year, their autonomous vehicles only traveled 590 cumulative miles - a fraction what Waymo's vehicles have completed. BMW didn't fare much better, reporting one disengagement over 638 miles. Despite Waymo's proven reliability, the self-driving company doesn't stack up to the rest of the competition in terms of overall progress. Navigant Research's leaderboard report on autonomous driving suggests that Waymo is ranked seventh on a list of top 10 vendors. BMW and Ford, whose disengagement reports fared worse results, both top Waymo on the list, with Ford considered the number one vendor. The report rated these self-driving industry players in ten categories: vision, go-to market strategy, partners, production strategy, technology, product capability, product quality and reliability, product portfolio, staying power, and sales, marketing and distribution. While the rankings show that Waymo features the most advanced technology, the report found that the company has no production capacity or production deals. 28/03/2017: Uber's San Francisco-based driverless car trials are back online following a short pause after one of its vehicles crashed in Arizona last week. “We are resuming our development operations in San Francisco this morning,” an Uber spokeswoman told TechCrunch yesterday morning. However, its Arizona and Pittsburgh-based trials will remain grounded until the company can investigate properly what went wrong when another car allegedly ploughed into the automated vehicle, knocking it over. Although Uber's cars can be driven without a driver, they all have manual controls built in too, so a human can take over when required. It would seem there was not enough time for the driver to take over and avoid the accident in Arizona, although it's still under investigation. TechCrunch explained that the cars used in the taxi firm's Californian trials are newer and therefore safer to drive. It's thought the trials in Pittsburgh and Arizona will resume ometime in the future, but Uber hasn't said when it's likely to happen yet. 27/03/2017: One of Uber's driverless vehicles has crashed during testing in the US, the company has confirmed. Pictures and a video of the incident were distributed on Twitter via @FrescoNews, where the source explained the accident happened in Tempe, Arizona, and no one was injured during the crash. "BREAKING: Self-driving Uber vehicle on it’s side after a collision in Tempe, AZ. Photos by @fresconews user Mark Beach," the news site said, followed by: "#UPDATE: No injuries yet reported in an accident involving a self-driving #uber, captured by @fresconews user Mark Beach in Tempe, AZ." Another source, local newspaper ABC15, said a normal passenger-operated car didn't stop for the automated vehicle and hit it. Uber's self-driving SUV fell on its side, witnesses said, and the driver of the manned car was given a talking to by police. There was a human behind the wheel and although initial reports said there was someone in the back of the autonomous car, Uber later said this wasn't the case. “We are continuing to look into this incident and can confirm we had no backseat passengers in the vehicle," Uber confirmed to TechCrunch in a statement. Uber has since paused its driverless cars trial programme in Arizona, but the company hasn't said how long for or whether schemes in other parts of the US have ground to a halt too. This is the second incident an Uber self-driving car has been involved in. The previous crash happened in California last December, when one of its vehicles failed to stop at a red light. 15/03/2017:  Intel has announced a $15.3 billion (£12.5 billion) proposal to acquire Jerusalem-based technology firm Mobileye, developer of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. The two companies have been collaborating alongside BMW since last year on a project aiming to produce driverless cars by 2021. Mobileye makes software and camera sensors for driverless cars, selling to companies such as General Motors, Nissan, and Hyundai. Intel said the acquisition expands its strategy to invest in data-intensive market opportunities that strengthen the company’s computing and connectivity capabilities.  According to Intel, the driverless technology market could be worth up to $70 billion by 2030, and the acquisition of Mobileye gives it a major boost in the autonomous driving race. “We expect the growth towards autonomous driving to be transformative,” said Mobileye CEO, President and Co-Founder, Ziv Aviram. He explained that by merging the infrastructure and resources of the two companies, their combined knowledge in areas like virtual driving, simulators, and hardware can be enhanced. “Together, we will provide an attractive value proposition for the automotive industry,” Aviram added. The acquisition is not only a step-up for Intel, but it’s also groundbreaking for the Israeli tech industry. The deal marks the largest-ever purchase of high-tech Israeli technology, significantly surpassing the previous record-holding deal of $4.7 billion paid by Lucent Technologies for Chromatis Networks in 2000. 14/03/2017: California's Department of Motor Vehicles has revealed it is looking at allowing driverless car manufacturers to test their vehicles without a human driver in the front seat. "Since the adoption of the current testing regulations, the capabilities of autonomous technology has proceeded to the point where manufacturers have developed systems that re capable of operating without the presence of a driver inside the vehicle," the proposal explained. "The department is amending Article 3.7 to include the testing of vehicles that do not require the presence of a driver inside the vehicle and ensure the testing of such vehicles is conducted on California public roads in a safe manner." Companies wanting to trial their cars without a driver inside must apply for a new type of licence -  Manufacturer's Testing Permit -Driverless Vehicles. The governmental organisation said it has changed its view towards autonomous vehicles to promote the development of autonomous technology that will lead to safer driving practices, it explained. "These rules expand our existing autonomous vehicle testing programme to include testing vehicles where no driver is present," said Jean Shiomoto, director of the California Department of Motor Vehicles. "This is the next step in eventually allowing driverless autonomous vehicles on California roadways." The department has invited the public to out forward their arguments for and against allowing such vehicles to be tested on the road, minus a driver. Written comments can be submitted until 24 April. 03/03/2017: After being driven out of San Francisco for failing to secure a testing permit, Uber has announced it will now cooperate with California regulators as it seeks to restart its driverless car trials in the state. California's Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed to Reuters that it had held discussions with Uber to assist the application process for a self-driving permit, something that Uber originally claimed was unnecessary. Uber launched its self-driving pilot programme in San Francisco last December without state permission, arguing that because its cars were not fully autonomous and required "active physical control or monitoring", they did not meet state requirements for the $150 permit. The state DMV, however, disagreed, arguing that not only did Uber fail to seek the correct permits, but also failed to properly mark their fleet as test vehicles. It also pointed to the number of other companies operating self-driving cars in the state, including Google, Tesla and Ford, who had all correctly secured testing permits. As a result, the DMV revoked the registrations of 16 Uber vehicles, only one week into the trial, with the threat of further legal action if they continued to test. Uber has since relocated those test vehicles to Arizona, where the company has received a warm welcome from Republican state governor Doug Ducey, but has reapplied for permission to test vehicles in California. An Uber spokesperson said in a statement to IT Pro: "These cars are legally registered and are being driven manually. We are taking steps to complete our application to apply for a DMV testing permit. As we said in December, Uber remains 100% committed to California." It comes just says after the firm's CEO, Travis Kalanick, said he needed to "grow up" and seek leadership advice. 24/02/2017: Alphabet's Waymo — Google's self-driving car project — has sued Uber, accusing it of stealing 14,000 files to copy its sensing tech. Waymo said Uber and the autonomous trucking firm Otto, which Uber bought last year, had stolen plans for Waymo's Lidar, a laser based sensing technology. The complaint filed in California said: "Uber's Lidar technology is actually Waymo's Lidar technology." Lidar bounces light off objects to "see" where they are — it's not a new technology, but Waymo's version is reportedly a tenth of the price of existing systems, according to Reuters. "Hundreds of Waymo engineers have spent thousands of hours, and our company has invested millions of dollars to design a highly specialised and unique Lidar system," the company said in a post on Medium. "Waymo engineers have driven down the cost of Lidar dramatically even as we’ve improved the quality and reliability of its performance. The configuration and specifications of our Lidar sensors are unique to Waymo. Misappropriating this technology is akin to stealing a secret recipe from a beverage company." Waymo said building the technology has taken seven years, while Uber's Otto appears to have done the same over nine months. The accusations centre on Anthony Levandowski, the founder of self-driving truck firm Otto, which hit the roads last year by shipping a lorry-load of Budweiser beer. In August, Uber bought the company. Before founding Otto, Levandowski worked on Google's self-driving project, now dubbed Waymo. It alleges that he downloaded 14,000 files before he resigned in January 2016 — including Lidar designs. "To gain access to Waymo’s design server, Mr. Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop," the Waymo blog post alleges. "Once inside, he downloaded 9.7 GB of Waymo’s highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation. Then he connected an external drive to the laptop. Mr. Levandowski then wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints." Waymo said it spotted the knockoff design via an email slip-up. "Recently, we received an unexpected email," the company said. "One of our suppliers specialising in Lidar components sent us an attachment (apparently inadvertently) of machine drawings of what was purported to be Uber’s Lidar circuit board  —  except its design bore a striking resemblance to Waymo’s unique Lidar design." Uber said it took the allegations "seriously" and would "review this matter carefully". Waymo is seeking unspecified damages, but asked for Uber to be banned from using the Lidar information. "Competition in the self-driving space is a good thing; it pushes everyone to develop better, safer and more affordable technology," Waymo said in the blog post. "But we believe that competition should be fueled by innovation in the labs and on the roads, not through unlawful actions." It's not the first legal battle in the self-driving arena: in January, Tesla sued a former director of its Autopilot automation project for poaching its staff. 22/02/2017: Just over two months to the day after being kicked out of San Francisco, Uber has begun trials of its self-driving fleet in Arizona, this time with the permission of the state's authorities.  Self-driving Ubers are hitting the road in the Grand Canyon State. pic.twitter.com/tOgiw4GD1d — Uber (@Uber) February 21, 2017 Arizona Republican governor Doug Ducey is expected to be 'Rider Zero' on the latest trial for the autonomous ride-hailing service, which is available to residents of Tempe starting today Uber's previous test of 16 self-driving cars in California in December was met with opposition from the Department of Motor Vehicles, which claimed the company failed to apply for the correct test permits. Uber always maintained that because a human was always behind the wheel, the cars did not fit the criteria for the $150 permit. It appears, however, that Arizona has taken an entirely different approach to the testing of autonomous vehicles. In August 2015, Ducey signed an executive order in support of the development of self-driving technology, urging authorities to "undertake any necessary steps to support the testing and operation of self-driving vehicles" on roads within Arizona. AZ Gov @dougducey taking a ride in @Uber_AZ's new self driving car. Pretty slick looking machine! pic.twitter.com/1zFoDNYUKV — Ty Brennan (@TyFox10) February 21, 2017 Customers in Tempe are now able to hail a self-driving Volvo XC90 SUV on the Uber service, which will be overseen by two Uber engineers in the front seats, in case a situation arises that requires human intervention. This signifies a much needed win for Uber given a series of bad press reports over the past few months. Aside from the controversy in California, the technology is far from perfect and has been caught running red lights, as well as narrowly avoiding a collision in San Francisco. The company itself has come under fire this week, with claims of rampant sexism from a former Uber engineer. Uber has said it plans to expand testing to other cities in Arizona within the next few weeks. 17/02/2017: Google patents car that 'prevents harm' in accidents Google has patented a technology that could prevent injuries in the event of an accident. The company has filed a patent with the US patent office for "adjusting a shear pin to minimize an impact force felt by an object in a collision with a vehicle". This means its self-driving cars' computers could analyse the amount of force needed to prevent injury or damage to the person, animal or object it's about the crash into. “Computing devices within a vehicle may determine that an impact with an object cannot be avoided by way of braking, steering, and/or accelerating the vehicle,” the patent explained. “When this is the case, the computing devices may work to adjust the amount of force necessary to break one or more shear pins which are holding a panel of the vehicle in place. The force of impact on the object which the vehicle collides may be reduced, thereby limiting the severity of injuries and/or damage to the object.” The computer device inside an autonomous car would receive data that it is about to collide with an object and the shear pin, which determines what will happen to a vehicle when it is subjected to pressure, would move into a position that would cause it to break, meaning the car's panels would slide back and absorb the impact. “The characteristics of the object with which impact is imminent may be used to determine to adjust the amount of shear force necessary to break the one or more shear pins, in an effort to minimize the impact force felt by the object,” the patent said. “The size of an object may be used to estimate its mass. This in turn may be used to determine the appropriate amount of shear force for the shear pins.” Google's automated car company, Waymo, hasn't revealed whether the technology will be integrated into its cars or if it will license the technology to other automated car makers. 16/02/2017: Microsoft India has just announced a partnership deal with India's Tata Motors, collaborating on technologies designed to make driving a more personalised experience. The new partnership will focus around AI, IoT and machine learning technologies, and will provide Tata vehicles with advanced telematics, remote monitoring and sophisticated navigation technologies. The first vehicle produced as part of the new agreement will be shown off at the Geneva International Motor Show on 7 March. The company wants to create "a highly personalised, smart and safer driving experience across the digital life of a vehicle owner", according to Tata Motors managing director, Guenter Butschek. "In the first phase, the advanced offerings will incorporate technologies such as cloud computing, analytics, geo-spatial and mapping and increased human-machine interface, creating a new benchmark in the industry for connected vehicles," he said. "Using the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies, we will provide the vehicle owners here as well as across the world a safe, productive and fun-driving experience," said Microsoft India's president, Anant Maheshwari, adding that Microsoft expects 90% of cars to be completely connected within three years. 13/02/2017: Ford is to invest $1 billion dollars into an AI startup over the next five years, comprised of ex-Google and Uber engineers who have worked on autonomous car projects. Argo AI will be led by CEO Bryan Salesky, formerly of Google, and Uber's Peter Rander as company COO, both of whom were leaders of their companies' self-driving car teams. The organisation, based at Ford's Pittsburgh headquarters, is expected to have more than 200 members by the end of the year. This represents the latest push by a car manufacturer into autonomous technology, which has become a highly competitive market over the past few years. Audi, Nissan, Tesla, and even companies traditionally not associated with vehicles, such as graphics processing firm Nvidia, are working on their own technology. "The next decade will be defined by the automation of the automobile, and autonomous vehicles will have as significant an impact on society as Ford's moving assembly line did 100 years ago," said Ford CEO Mark Fields. "We believe that investing in Argo AI will create significant value for our shareholders by strengthening Ford's leadership in bringing self-driving vehicles to market in the near term, and by creating technology that could be licensed to others in the future." The deal will see Ford focus on its development of vehicle hardware, including the exterior and interior design of autonomous cars, and the integration of new systems. Argo AI will latch onto Ford's current software development teams and help the company scale up its production. If all goes to plan, Ford intends to have a fully autonomous, level 4-capable vehicle for the commercial market by 2021. This, according to the Society of Automated Engineers (SAE), is one rank behind "fully autonomous", in which the AI is able to fully control every aspect of the driving and does not rely on the input of a human driver. "We are at an inflection point in using artificial intelligence in a wide range of applications, and the successful deployment of self-driving cars will fundamentally change how people and goods move," said Salesky, Argo AI's CEO. "We believe this partnership will enable self-driving cars to be commercialised and deployed at scale to extend affordable mobility to all." Although Argo AI will initially focus on supporting the production of Ford vehicles, the company has stated that future plans could include the licensing out of its technology to other firms wishing to move into the autonomous sector.

The Department for Transport is set to unveil plans for the two-in-one policy as it attempts to reduce the legal hurdles preventing self-driving cars from hitting the road in the UK. Who would ultimately be responsible for the cause of a driverless accident has been the cause of significant debate for legal bodies across the world. The latest plans will introduce policies that cover drivers while they are at the wheel, and then allows responsibility to be handed over to AI while in driverless mode. Claims made against accidents involving AI will be covered by the insurance company who will recuperate losses from the party responsible, which may include the car manufacturer. The government hopes this will make it easier for victims of crashes involving driverless vehicles to access compensation. "Automated vehicles have the potential to transform our roads in the future and make them even safer and easier to use, as well as promising new mobility for those who cannot drive," said transport secretary Chris Grayling, in a statement to the Telegraph. "But we must ensure the public is protected in the event of an incident and this week we are introducing the framework to allow insurance for these new technologies." Accidents involving driverless cars have raised questions as to who exactly is to blame for a crash. In June last year a driver was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer after failing to break. But the government is keen to encourage the growth of the driverless car industry in the UK, an industry analysts predict will be worth almost $42 billion globally by 2025. Ian Crowder, head of public relations at AA, argued that although improving policies will make insurance claims more streamlined, there is no way to predict how other human drivers will respond to an increase in driverless vehicles.  "In the longer term the number of claims should dramatically fall," said Crowder. "However there are concerns relating to the behaviour of drivers of human-driven cars mixing with autonomous vehicles, which could lead to an increase in collisions." "For example, frustration at autonomous vehicles sticking to the speed limit; human drivers attempting to fit into smaller spaces between autonomous vehicles etc... which could lead to an increased number of collisions so that could lead in turn, to an increase in premiums overall," added Crowder. Japanese car manufacturer Nissan is expected to go ahead with its plans to test driverless cars on the streets of London later this month, following successful preliminary tests in Milton Keynes last year. 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

Today's episode of Whiteboard Friday is densely packed with all the image SEO tips you could ever want, from the bare basics to ranking factors to important next-steps. Click on the whiteboard image above to open a high-resolution version in a new tab! Video Transcription Howdy, Moz fans, and welcome to another edition of Whiteboard Friday. This week, we're going to chat all things image SEO, so SEO for photos, for visuals, for graphics, and talk a little bit about how you rank, not just in Google Image Search, but also in Google in the Image Pack. Image SEO basics: Look, there are a couple of things that we should discuss before we even get into that. First off, many folks are asking... 1. "Is it still even worthwhile to do Image Search SEO?" You might recall that in years past, when you clicked on an image in Google Image Search, you would go to the website or the webpage that had that image on it. Now, if you click it, Google opens up a full-sized version of that, tells you the website it's on. But for many people, that's enough. They do a bunch of searches and never actually visit your website. Google is just serving up your image unbeknownst to you, and you don't even get any data on that. So you don't know how many impressions it gets, all that kind of stuff. So here's the case for Image Search SEO. Visually sold products and services - We've talked to many people who are contractors or decorators, remodelers, hotel owners or hoteliers, craft sellers, and they find that image search is something that people do as research before they choose them. In fact, you might see actual searches for "kitchen remodel Seattle," and then people will base their decision of who to go with based on the images that pop up there, they'll visit that website. Anything that's designed to earn links and citations - So if you're producing graphs or data, or you're taking photos of events or of people, and you're hoping that those people or other folks will go and use your images and then link back to you, you definitely want to do Image Search SEO. That can get you in front of that right audience. When they use your image in their presentation or their publication or their website, you get the link. Visual content licensers - Very obviously, they make their living selling images. Google Image Search is a great way to get in there. So if you're a photographer or an illustrator or a stock gallery, you certainly would want to be doing that as well. *A couple of data points: One comes from Jumpshot, whose U.S. dataset is fairly sizeable, in the millions of searchers. They see that about a third of all the searches performed on Google are performed in Google Image Search, which is just mind-bogglingly crazy, like huge. I never realized how big Google Image Search was until I saw that Jumpshot data. It's just massive. MozCast shows us that about 12.5% of all Google searches in the web results do show an Image Pack somewhere in there. 2. Do you have to use original visuals? Or can you, for example, license visual content from other folks? Can you buy a stock image and put that on your site and potentially still rank for it in Google Images? The answer is, actually, yes. So unlike web results, duplicates are not viewed as a problem. Google Image Search will generally take one version of an image, and that'll rank higher than the others. But it's not always the original. In fact, many times it's not the original source. It's a page that does a really good job of Image Search SEO. So this is a great opportunity for SEOs to get some extra traffic. Just make sure that you have the right permissions. 3. How do you figure out if image SEO is actually something you should be doing? Well, for any given keyword, for example, I searched for "Santa Fe architecture" here, and there's a result, I think at the top. Maybe it's an ad result. Then there's the image block with a few photos in there. Google is only going to show that image block if and when the searchers are actually clicking over to images very frequently, or there are lots of searches directly on Google Images for that term. So Google itself can sort of be that indicator for you of whether there's demand. What are the rankings elements for Google images + image packs? Now, if you are curious about doing this image SEO and you've decided, "Okay, this probably makes sense. I should try it out. I should do some. I've got some uses cases," my strong suggestion would be that you look at all the ranking factors. They're actually quite broad, but they're not nearly as complicated. Or they're a little more basic than we're used to with web results. I think that is because, when it comes to images, Google is mostly hyper-concerned with relevance and serving the user's interest, rather than link popularity. They don't worry as much nearly about spamming and manipulation in those results. So you can see them using a sort of more old-school style algorithm. So here's a page with some pictures of Santa Fe on it, and things that Google might use are: A. The image file name B. The alt attribute on the image. Another very important reason to add alt attributes, in addition to accessibility reasons, is for Image Search SEO. It does seem to help a little bit, maybe, with web results SEO too. C. The image caption. So this is something where we've actually seen the caption be more important than the alt attribute when it comes to Image Search. So if you put that little caption down below, underneath your image, that can actually help with the Image Search rankings. D. Surrounding text content. So Google is going to look at this text above and below and around the images to see if it has relevance. E. The page title, of course. F. The page URL that it's hosted on. This is one of the reasons, by the way, that galleries of images, especially inside stock photo galleries, don't tend to do very well, because there's very little sort of relevant content surrounding them. They tend to be in these big, gallery-style layouts. So there are tons of images all in one page, when what Google is looking for is just one or two that are hyper-relevant to the particular topic, which is why most of the images you see doing really well in Google Image Search are the ones that live, not by themselves necessarily, but are the premier image on that particular page. G. Image engagement and popularity. This is a big one. We have seen results where folks have done tests. They've shown that if you do a search on Google Images and you click the 12th image down and a lot of people start doing that, Google will move it up, just like in the web results, but sometimes even more so with images. We think engagement and popularity, what people scroll to, what they click on, what they click through to, matters quite a bit. That's why you should have a very high-quality, highly interesting, highly relevant image, as well as you also want to serve visitor demand. H. The image dimensions matter. So if you do a Google Image Search, you will notice that they don't show, or they rarely show, unusual image dimensions. So an image like this, which is very, very horizontal and not very vertical, probably wouldn't do well. Just as a very vertical, not very horizontal one. They tend to look for sort of 16 by 9, 4 by 3, square images, and sometimes turned on their side so vertically it can work, as well. But anything much more than that and you get into problems. I. Image size. So Google is generally not looking for very small images. They also tend not to show gigantic ones, although they sometimes will scale it down. If you do searches for anything plus "wallpaper," Google knows that the intent is for very large sizes, and so they will show that. J. Embeds of the image. So if your visual appears on many different websites and pages, and it's been embedded multiple times, that seems to have a positive impact. K. Traditional web ranking factors on the existing URL. So if this page, architecture.com/santafe, happened to rank well, in the top five or six or seven for "Santa Fe architecture," chances are good that images from that page would also rank in the first few images results. The reverse isn't always true. But if you can get the ranking in web results, you can generally do well in the image results as well. Why wouldn't you want to? Because you can get traffic from both. L. Google seems to finally have gotten to the point where they have some sophistication, and they're doing a little bit of image relevance and visual match in here too. So if you have a picture of a koala, as adorable as that might be, even if you have every other factor in here, they probably won't show you for "Santa Fe architecture," at least not for long. What steps should I take with image SEO? Well, just a few. I want you to... 1. Determine your SEO goals, and then I want you to compare those SEO goals against your keyword research list. 2. Audit of your keyword research list for image visibility. Keyword Explorer is actually really awesome for this. I think there are probably some other tools that do it, but right now Keyword Explorer is one of the best. You can also do it in Moz Pro. You basically plug in all your keywords, you go to your list page, and you see what number of results actually have image blocks like this in them. That will tell you what kind of opportunity you've got. If you decide that you're going to do any image SEO at all and it matches with your goals, you're then going to... 3. Create a set of guidelines for content creators/publishers on your site. I want these guidelines basically to be for anyone who's creating content on the site, if you are putting an image in, just do these three or four things. Make sure you've got the caption right. Make sure you do the image alt attribute. Make sure that the size and dimensions are right, and you do some image optimization so it loads quickly on mobile, those kinds of things. 4. Create a target list of image SEO opportunities to pursue. So these would be like the 5 or 10, or if you're bigger, maybe 50 keywords that you know have image blocks in them, or that you know get lots of image searches, and therefore you're trying to target them. You can then go actually create the priority of, "Hey, we need a visual for this. Hey, we need to put it on a page, and we need to nail these things." 5. Audit your existing images on your site for SEO and UX optimization (size, speed compression, etc.) Probably, there's a bunch of low-hanging fruit that you're missing out on. My recommendation, check out Ryan Ayres' "How to Perform an Image Optimization Audit" from last year on Moz's website. Really good post, walks you through how to use Screaming Frog to do this and how to optimize all those visuals. Thanks for sticking with me through all this dense information on image SEO. I hope you rock the image rankings, and we'll see you again next week for another edition of Whiteboard Friday.

I say so because Images Search is changing a lot since a couple of month and for well. If you remember my post here in December, I was telling - with one my classic rhetorical exaggerations - that the Images vertical was the "Zombie vertical" of Google, but that it could have chances to return to a real life. In your checklist, which is good, I'd add a couple of elements that are strictly linked between them, and that we can define a "Semantic Search for Images". The first and most impacting one is optimizing for being shown as "Similar Item". Right now it's still bit experimental and it is available only for some kind of fashion apparels like handbags, sunglasses, and shoes. For having a chance that the Machine Vision technology of Google (Machine Learning, again) picks our image as a similar item, we must have implemented schema.org/Product complete with an image href referral tagged. Important note: if your site has an independent m. version, implement schema.org/Product also there!!!! Why I say this... because similar item is available only on mobile search and Android Google Search app right now. The second one is more related to Semantic in terms of Context. One of the biggest pet peeves I have is noticing how people insert images in their pages "just because". Instead they should be placed wisely and into the context of the written content surrounding them, because Google finally seems rolling out globally a "pintereresque" tag's carrousel that serves for helping users refining their image searches (see an example here) and that has been saw first as a test in Google.it (yup: Italy first!) last year. In the images search result snapshot I linked above, you can see how Google presents different "related images searches" to the one I did ("Obi Wan Kenobi") and they are shown with a color based classification, so we can easily distinguish "Images of related movies", "Images of related characters" and "images of related actors" (if you scroll you can see many other different "categories"). You can understand now why my alert for context now is so important... imagine what that may mean for images that are eligible for being used as Similar Item ;-)... huge visibility in a wide range of Images Search results! As a plus, if you tag them with http://schema.org/ImageObject and use the SameAs property I'll offer you a beer at MozCon). gfiorelli1 edited 2017-05-12T01:34:39-07:00 5 0 Reply <p>Hi Rand,</p>

In my amateurish and slightly random testing, I think I'm seeing the image filename having way more impact than I'd expect. I also think I'm seeing uniqueness of images impacting ranking. In both of those cases, I'm talking about image SEO affecting the ranking of the page in the regular web results (not image search). I'd LOVE to see a test that examined the impact of image originality on web page ranking....in other words, if you use your own original image on a page, vs. an image that's found on 20 other sites vs. the typical cheesy stock photo image of a handful of people in a meeting room, sucked down from one of the stock photo sites and used on 500 websites. Changing gears a bit, if you DO use your own original images, here's a link-building tip for you: do a Google reverse image search for your photos, and when you find others using them without your permission, send a gentle email to those webmasters asking that they credit you for that photo on their page with a caption and a link back to your site. 3 0 Reply <p>Stop giving away all my tricks, Rand!

As a travel blogger I find it extremely unfair that my photos can be stolen, improved on SEO and then be reused elsewhere, thus hijacking my traffic. It so happened to me with a nice shot of the spectacular Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore. I published my image referral traffic here and also what happened to it after the picture was stolen. Shouldn't Google know where it first discovered the photo and then stick to that source? BTW, just recently the new Adobe Lightroom plugin "JPEGOptimizer" was published. It helps reducing image size significantly. In Lightroom you can maintain most of the SEO factors you mentioned, say file name, caption, keywords, image dimensions, file size and also a watermark for branding purposes. 2 0 Reply <p>Thanks Rand!

A few comments and a question about your point that "MozCast shows us that about 12.5% of all Google searches in the web results do show an Image Pack somewhere in there." First, I think it's worth mentioning that this percentage is significantly down from before September 2016, when it was more than 30%, as observed by the SEM Post for example. Personally, I think this is another example of how greedy Google is becoming, because the visually attractive Image Pack clearly competes with the Google Shopping ads which they are pushing more and more. Second, I observe that not only the percentage of searches that include an Image Pack is down, but also that the Image Pack is ranking much lower than before. Before Sept 2016, if there was an Image Pack, it was frequently ranking as #1, and almost always in the top 3. Nowadays, the Image Pack is frequently at the end of the page, in position #8-10 (far away from the Google Shopping ads I might add). This has further reduced the traffic that some of my customers' websites get from image search. Do you have any data on this trend as well? Best wishes from France!

Sign up Premium Podcast Jobs Insights DIY LATEST NEWS STORIES MORE CHOICES MUSIC | MUSIC PEOPLE | MUSIC BUSINESS Sign up Premium Podcast Jobs Insights DIY Business News Digital Labels & Publishers YouTube doesn’t negatively impact on the streaming market, says YouTube By Chris Cooke | Published on Friday 12 May 2017 Value gap? What value gap? A new report confirms once and for all that Google’s YouTube doesn’t have any particularly negative impact on the other streaming music services, despite all the free music it offers. And who commissioned this report? Google. So, you know, they’d know, surely? The web giant paid a company called RBB Economics to survey 1500 music consumers on its platform in a bid to respond to the music industry’s repeated vocal criticism of YouTube. And in particular the industry’s argument that the Google site exploits the copyright safe harbours to secure preferential deals from music rights owners, while hindering the growth of premium streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music that pay much better rates to the record labels and music publishers. The Europe-focused study reckons that – if all the music was somehow removed from YouTube – 85% of the time, users who are currently tapping some tunes on the video site would instead rely on TV or radio for their music, which pay relatively low royalties too. Users would also spend 29% more time on piracy networks. While, when it comes to a music ban on YouTube driving new premium subscriptions elsewhere, the report reckons that only 15% of even heavy music users on the video site, who consume more than 20 hours of music there each month, would suddenly start paying to stream. Though that figure varies from country to country. In the UK, 19% would go premium, whereas only 12% would in France. The report also uses YouTube’s long stand-off with German collecting society GEMA to provide a ‘control’ territory, capitalising on the fact that the PRO finally did a deal with YouTube last November to compare music usage in Germany before and after that agreement. Blocking tracks on YouTube had no effect on their performance on the other streaming services, the report reckons. Says Patrick Smith at RBB Economics: “Our research examines the question of cannibalisation and finds that in the absence of YouTube, most time spent listening to music would be lost or move to similar or lower value channels, including file-sharing and piracy”. Yeah, well they would say that wouldn’t they? That’s what you’re all thinking right now, aren’t you? Needless to say, reps for the record industry weren’t persuaded or impressed by Google’s new research, which is a simple PR move – the labels reckon – to try to distract law-makers in Europe who are considering measures to limit the reach of the aforementioned safe harbour. “Google’s latest publicity push once again seeks to distract from the fact that YouTube, essentially the world’s largest on-demand music service, is failing to license music on a fair basis and compensate artists and producers properly by claiming it is not liable for the music it is making available”, said globally-focused trade group IFPI. “Services like YouTube, that are not licensing music on fair terms, hinder the development of a sustainably healthy digital music market. Rather than Google/YouTube’s ‘my way or the highway’ approach, where they say they can’t behave as other digital music services do, legislative action is required to address the ‘value gap’ that is denying music creators a fair return for their work and investment so that the recent upturn [in recorded music revenues] will be sustainable for the long term”. Meanwhile, the boss of the UK record industry’s trade group BPI, Geoff Taylor, questioned YouTube’s conclusions of its own research, reckoning that “despite its misleading headlines, the data in this Google-commissioned report reinforces the fact that YouTube is having a negative impact on revenues from recorded music”. He went on: “RBB’s report for Google confirms that a significant proportion of YouTube consumption would move onto a higher value service if music were not available on YouTube. RBB’s data shows that nearly a fifth of YouTube usage in the UK would divert onto higher value platforms, such as paid subscription services”. Doing some number crunching, he continued: “If that usage were evenly distributed among YouTube’s users and 19% of YouTube users chose to take out a music subscription, it would generate approximately £415 million per annum additional retail spend on music – doubling the current value of the UK streaming market. Even if only half this number chose to subscribe, the shift would still make an enormous difference to the UK’s artists, songwriters and labels and to the growth of our digital music sector”. “This data therefore reinforces the argument that creators have been making about the value gap for some time”, Taylor concluded. “YouTube continues to rely on a legal loophole to pay only a tiny fraction of the rate that competing services such as Spotify and Apple pay for music. This patently unfair distortion in the digital content market must be fixed once and for all, and we again call on the UK government and on EU policymakers to clarify that online platforms must secure fair arms’ length licences for the content that they commercially exploit”.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Contacts gets a minor update: slight redesign and new features Newsby Brian Reigh19 hours ago 7 301 15 Google Contacts is being updated to version 2.0 with minor design changes and new features like Google’s standard account switcher. See also: How to transfer your contacts from iPhone to Android January 25, 2017 The search giant added stock Android Phone and Contacts apps to the Play Store back in 2015, and since then, the latter has seen quite a few updates. Compared to most third-party contacts apps out there, Google’s own offers a cleaner look and all the features that the company deems necessary on an Android device. Well, Google has updated Contacts to version 2.0, and while it’s not a major update by any means, it further streamlines user experience by introducing slight changes. Everything looks even more quintessentially Google: from the flat greyish colors to the Floating Action Button towards the bottom for edits. 9to5Google The main list remains largely identical as before although now you have the option to select multiple contacts to share, delete, apply labels, or move. Once you tap on one of your contacts, you’ll notice that the large rectangular profile photo has now been reduced to a circular crop, and everything looks even more quintessentially Google: from the flat greyish colors to the Floating Action Button towards the bottom for edits. As 9to5Google points out, another big change is the addition of a standard Android account switcher. Similar to what you see on Google apps like Gmail or Play Store, you now have circular profile photos indicating all the Google accounts that are signed in. While Contacts version 2.0 doesn’t bring huge changes, the update is yet another effort from Google to further refine its apps.

In the meantime, Google decided to go in line with the concept of Bitmoji, a popular app that creates cool avatars out of user's photograph, and introduced a new feature in Allo that lets you turn your selfies into personalised cartoon stickers and emojis. It is currently rolling out on Allo on Android, while the iOS version will soon receive the feature. While the functionality of generating stickers out of selfies is not new and has already been available on Bitmoji for enough time, Google's version uses a combination of neural networks and the work of artists, which have partnered with the company. In simple terms, Google Allo will employ machine learning to map selfies to produce the colour, structure, and animations for the stickers. These stickers can be further customised as per the user's preference. In its research blog post, Google's Expressions Creative Director for Allo, Jennifer Daniel explains, "To create an illustration of you that captures the qualities that would make it recognizable to your friends, we worked alongside an artistic team to create illustrations that represented a wide variety of features. Artists initially designed a set of hairstyles, for example, that they thought would be representative, and with the help of human raters we used these hairstyles to train the network to match the right illustration to the right selfie." Keeping in mind the perspective of gender neutrality, inclusion of all races and colour, Google Allo creates stickers and emojis belonging to people of all races, gender and colour. In an interview with Fast Company, Jason Cornwell, who leads UX department for Google's communication projects, noted that the creation of emojis and stickers do not become an end goal instead it is a part of an effort that is aimed "to let someone create something that feels like themselves, to themselves." Elaborating on the advancement of machine learning and algorithms used for Google Allo's sticker creation technology, Daniel refers to the concept of 'Uncanny Valley' which is the hypothesis that human replicas which appear almost, but not exactly, like real human beings elicit feelings of eeriness and revulsion among some observers, as on Wikipedia. "Rather than aim to replicate a person's appearance exactly, pursuing a lower resolution model, like emojis and stickers, allows the team to explore expressive representation by returning an image that is less about reproducing reality and more about breaking the rules of representation," he notes while explaining how the company takes note of emotions rather than focusing on the visible physical appearances.

You go to make breakfast and see that you’re out of butter, but it doesn’t matter, because a delivery is on its way. On your commute, you catch up with friends from back home. You turn to news across the Atlantic, read an interesting article on Trump. You go to a new spot for lunch and pay using your phone – and also for the train, and then for the last stretch, a cab. Once home, dinner is by app, and you settle down to watch the latest TV show, except, it’s not actually shown on a TV. It’s possible that this entire day is delineated by a handful of technology companies. Google Home wakes you up in the morning and later, Google recommends a lunch spot – it even gives you live information on how busy it is. It is partly responsible for your cab home, as Google is an investor in Uber. You checked in with friends on Facebook on that morning commute (you might have also used the Facebook “check-in” feature at your lunch spot). Google will now tell you whether a bar or shop is busy in real-time Read more The Trump piece you read is courtesy of the Washington Post, owned by Jeff Bezos, the man behind Amazon. Amazon is also responsible for recognising that your fridge is out of butter, and the TV show you watch? Even if you are watching Netflix and not Amazon Prime, Netflix would not exist without Amazon, as Amazon owns the web cloud services its rival uses. With an 18% share of the smartphone market, it’s likely the apps you use are running on an iPhone. No? Well, maybe you have an Android device – owned by Google. Cabal is not too strong a word. Take Amazon. It’s unfathomable, when you think about it. The idea of selling books online morphing into something that wants to get in your home and even the bottom drawer of your freezer, and – as we learned this week – live music events. You might think that tech companies are taking over the globe – until you realise that Google, or rather Google’s parent company Alphabet, has invested in a space exploratory arm, Space X. So not just the globe. (Amazon and Facebook have also dipped their toes into space.) Google’s latest mission, in fact, is taking on death itself. Why not? Thing is, none of this might bother you. Why should it? All of these companies improve our lives, right? I’d go as far as to say Google has made me a smarter person. It’s perhaps made me a more intolerant person, because I believe there are very few gaps in knowledge that can’t be filled by an online search, and most of us, in developed countries at least, carry that ability in our pockets. It’s why I love the Let Me Google That For You website – in which askers of easily answerable questions are sent an automatic link that enters the question into Google, to shame their indolence. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘Recently there’s been speculation that Mark Zuckerberg might run for US office.’ Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images It could be argued that tech has made us lazier, but I’d counter that it has only made us lazier in whichever area we tended to be lazy in already. I’m a bad cook, so apps such as Uber Eats or Deliveroo, on my Apple phone, have perhaps made me lazier, but if I was a better cook I might not use them. (And the tech, if I wasn’t as lazy, could help me get better at cooking.) But I’m not going to stop drawing by hand, something I enjoy, just because there’s an app I can do that on. It’s undeniable that tech has changed our lives fundamentally, but in often very good ways. The problem is, a small group of companies ruling the world, just as with people, is not a good thing. This is why antitrust laws exist. It’s why Rupert Murdoch has suddenly started to clean up Fox and News UK, because he wants his BSkyB bid to go ahead, despite considerable concerns of a monopoly. Recently there’s been speculation that Mark Zuckerberg might run for US office. I am not being hyperbolic when I say that it’s possible he would have less power if he was president than he does now. Facebook has 1.28 billion daily active users. Most individuals now get their news via the platform and, as was emphasised in the election of Donald Trump, this is problematic when there’s a lack of editorial control. Zuck at first tried to play down Facebook’s “fake news” influence, which was difficult when simultaneously boasting about his company’s influence on voter turnout and engagement. And I’ll tell you something; there’s nothing more incensing than a dude bashing out a 5,000-word manifesto on how he wants to change the world having based some of his operations in offshore locations so he can avoid paying corporate taxes. Likewise, it is disingenuous at best and dictatorial at worst to say you want to help extend India’s internet access and then make Facebook one of few available websites. Mark Zuckerberg pens major Facebook manifesto on how to burst the bubble Read more And if you want to opt out? Well, it isn’t always that easy. Some of these companies make it difficult to cut ties entirely, hence concerns around data retention and individual rights. But the other point is that unilateral opting out might mean you end up living a somewhat ascetic life. I quit Facebook in 2013, and as a direct result of this, I have fallen out of touch with many friends. People have had babies, people have got married and divorced and other people have died and I have been absolutely none the wiser, because I don’t keep up with Facebook. Sure, that’s my own fault, but I was tired of the banalities of the medium and the time it was taking up in my life, and the concern that Facebook was following me everywhere, like the eyes of an Old Master painting. It is time now for two things: for people to wake up and realise how much our lives are dominated by such a small number of Silicon Valley bros, one hand in their jean pocket announcing their next move, and for tech companies to acknowledge their power and influence and become truly accountable. To pay their goddamn taxes. To actually do something about online abuse. To not take the piss out of consumers by releasing a $700 product and then tweaking it months later for greater profit. I don’t want to worry that the curating of Apple News is quasi-Pravda. Or that companies are making money from extremist content. And I understand that in so many “free” services we pay a different way, by becoming a product ourselves, and giving up some of of our privacy. That’s a trade that many of us are willing to make and will keep making, but up to a point. Up to a point.

They may refer to a recent case where Google was charged 300 million euro in a penalty tax. Besides Google, multinational enterprises including Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, Oracle and Cisco have repeatedly been accused of dodging taxes although they generate handsome profits in Korea. The new head of state has no reason not to follow the case in Italy because there are similar controversies in Korea involving multinational companies. If the Italian case is not enough for Moon to take heart, here are some other examples. Zero tolerance against tax evasion On May 4, Google said it will pay 300.6 million euro in taxes to make up for money it didn't pay over the last decade. Italy's tax authority investigated the IT giant, alleging that the company had not paid tax on the 1 billion euro in sales it generated in the country between 2002 and 2015. The Italian tax authority argued that Google's sales generated by selling paid mobile applications or advertisements to Italian consumers were subject to taxation in the country. Google had made Italian consumers directly deal with its European headquarters in Ireland through the internet. In this way, Google redirected the sales in Italy to its branch in Ireland, which has only a 12.5 percent of corporate tax rate compared to Italy's 24 percent. Countries other than Italy, such as Britain, France, Russia, Australia and Indonesia are also pushing to levy tax on multinational enterprises which have avoided taxation by finding legal loopholes. On April 2015, Britain introduced a law that levies a 25 percent penalty tax on multinational enterprises if they avoid tax by recording sales generated in Britain in another country. Following this law, the British government collected 130 million pounds from Google in January last year. France is pushing to collect 1.6 billion euro from Google. The French prosecution raided Google's office in Paris over alleged tax evasion and money laundering charges in May last year. In June, Google's office in Madrid was also raided by the Spanish police for alleged tax evasion. Last August, the European Commission (EC) ordered Apple to pay 13 billion euro of tax to Ireland. It said the Irish government's excessive tax benefits for Apple were a violation of European Union rules. Both Apple and the Irish government appealed the order. The EC is also looking into Amazon for allegedly cutting taxes on its gains generated in Europe by registering it to its subsidiary in Luxemburg, which has a lower tax rate. In 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the G20 member nations started global cooperation against such tax-dodging by multinational enterprises. The enterprises have also been criticized for sidestepping Korea's Tax Law. Korean cases Many foreign countries are increasingly tightening their taxation rights on multinational enterprises by strengthening investigations. The government should be able to collect the tax from multinational enterprises here on the massive gains they generate in Korea. The country's tax authority is actually very good at this, so I wonder why it turns a blind eye only on foreign players. According to the Korea Mobile Internet Business Association (MOIBA), Google generated about 4.5 trillion won in sales last year from the Google Play mobile app market in Korea. This is 58.2 percent of 7.6 trillion won of the nation's total mobile app market in 2016. Considering that Google collects a 30 percent fee for the mobile app market, its profit is estimated at 1.34 trillion won last year. The association projected that Google's mobile app market profit will reach 1.6 trillion this year. Google distributes mobile apps made by Korean developers not through Google Korea but Google Asia Pacific in Singapore. Despite its heavy estimated gains here, the National Tax Service (NTS) has had difficulty in monitoring Google Korea as it is not obliged to open its books on revenue and taxation as it is a limited liability company. As a result, the country fails to collect proper taxes from Google. The new president is required to change this. For Oracle, the NTS recently levied 314.7 billion won in corporate tax on Oracle Korea for the money not paid between 2008 and 2014. Oracle filed a suit at Seoul Administrative Court in February to request the overturning of the tax authority's order. Cisco, the dominant provider of network equipment in Korea, has also been accused of sidestepping tax here by making its smaller local distribution partners directly make deals with suppliers in other countries with lower tax rates. The usual suspect in this kind of debate has remained silent about the issue. I think the tax authority should not let it do so. yoonsw@ktimes.comMore articles by this reporter President Moon's 'reign of beauty' Four reasons to go to Wando Moon Jae-in's inauguration speech [FULL SCRIPT] Moon hints at scrapping 'comfort women' deal in phone talks with Abe Banks need cultural change amid disruption CIA creates special unit to counter N.

U.S. district judge William Alsup also partially granted Waymo's bid for an injunction against Uber's self-driving efforts, and rejected Uber's arguments that the trade secret allegations should proceed in private. Google's self-driving Waymo car division originally filed the lawsuit against Uber in February, accusing the company of stealing its self-driving intellectual property. Specifically, former Google employee Anthony Levandowski is accused of stealing 14,000 confidential files that included data on Waymo's laser-based radar (LiDAR) system, which the company called "one of the most powerful parts" of its self-driving technology. In referring the case to the U.S. Department of Justice, Judge Alsup said that in the absence of "smoking gun" proof of wrongdoing by Uber, he was not taking a position on whether or not charges are warranted, but noted there was "ample evidence" that Levandowski had breached his duty of loyalty to Waymo. Uber declined to comment on the referral to prosecutors, while Levandowski has already recused himself from LiDAR-related work while the case is ongoing, but the news is yet another setback for the ride-hailing service as it attempts to revive its tarnished image following multiple controversies over recent months. The Department of Justice is already investigating the company over its use of "secret" software that allowed its drivers to operate in areas where Uber was banned or restricted. The so-called "greyball" software is said to have allowed the company to identify undercover officials and block them from booking rides, in order to prevent them from proving that Uber was operating illegally. Last month it emerged that Apple CEO Tim Cook threatened to pull Uber's app from the App Store in early 2015 after discovering that it was secretly "fingerprinting" iPhones that used the app. Uber said it used the identification method to prevent fraud, despite knowing the tactic is a clear violation of Apple's app privacy guidelines.

Color me shocked. :rolleyes: Rating: 2 Votes 78Bandit 15 hours ago at 09:39 am You can't expect a majority of consumers to be advocates for social justice. People generally want the best product at the best price and don't think about the processes that created it. You see it all the time in animal cruelty accusations against the big farm conglomerates like Tyson. People still buy their product even though their suppliers engage in reprehensible behavior and are repeatedly outed by animal protection groups and agencies. Ultimately that is what laws and the court system are for. They enforce behavioral codes like theft of intellectual property. Depending on consumers to even remotely give a crap, let alone pay a higher price or experience less convenience, in protest of a company's unethical behavior is an exercise in frustration. Even the best organized boycotts will fizzle out after a relatively short period of time in the absence of publicized legal intervention.

However according to recent rumors, we could be getting more than we bargained for with a third device whose codename “Taimen” was mentioned in the past. If you’re wondering about the existence of Taimen, it seems that the device was spotted yet again, this time on Geekbench where it was seen running Android O, the latest build of Android. This really shouldn’t be surprising as Google’s flagship phones typically launch with the latest version of Android installed on it. Also according to the benchmarks, the handset will be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 clocked at 1.9GHz. Once again this isn’t surprising especially when you consider the fact that the Snapdragon 835 is the flagship chipset for Qualcomm for 2017, and it was also revealed in an earlier report that all of Google’s Pixel phones of 2017 will be powered by the chipset. In any case take it with a grain of salt since benchmarks can be faked, but it definitely lends credence to the rumors and speculation as to existence of the device. Whether or not we’re looking at a third Pixel handset or a separate device entirely still remains to be seen. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about Android and Google.

The smartphone features a Qualcomm octa-core processor clocked at 1.9 GHz and there is 4 GB of RAM as well, according to the benchmark. The score is 1,804 on the single-core test and 6,248 on the multi-core test. While these are good, they are not quite extraordinary. This means that one of the three speculated Pixel smartphones will probably not run on a Snapdragon 835. The Samsung Galaxy S8 with the Snapdragon 835 according to GSMArena scored 1,929 in single-core and 6,084 in multi-core. The same source put out a leaked benchmark score of the upcoming OnePlus 5, which is also rumored to comes with same chipset with an impressive score of 1,963 on single-core and 6,687 on multi-core. If you noticed, the clock speed of Taimen is not the same as that of the Snapdragon 835. Now this could mean two possibilities.  Firstly, it could be a mid-range processor like the Snapdragon 660, making one of the three Pixel smartphones a mid-range variant. Secondly, the benchmark could be running the tests at the lowest possible clock speed, which is a bit unlikely.

It’s a simple app, but one that could come in handy when you’re trying to say “Sorry for my poor Chinese” and not “poor Chinese person.” Then again, depending on how long it takes to translate and re-translate and re-type a new sentence — the most value might just come from seeing how ridiculous the initial translations are. Boomerang, which was created by indie app developer Ishmael Shabazz, is free to download, but has ads; for an ad-free experience, you can pay a $1.99 annual subscription. Shabazz said in a note to The Verge that Google charges $20 for every million characters translated through Google Translate, so he’s basically wagering that the combination of ad revenue and subscription revenue will be higher than the translation expenses. Google’s translation software has gotten increasingly sophisticated in a remarkably short period of time, thanks to the magic of machine learning. Last fall the company said it was starting to use a new technique, called Google Neural Machine Translation, to vastly improve its AI-powered translation system. Shabazz says he welcomes the day when a tool like Boomerang is no longer needed, but that he foresees it being useful for quite some time. Related links: The Verge.

It has been designed for use by brands and agencies who want to ensure campaigns are free from malware before putting them out into the wider world, both protecting consumers and their clients from malware that could otherwise be lurking in ads. Google's Cloud Vision API detects and rejects ad types that aren't allowed to be displayed, plus identifies content that won't render correctly or click through as planned, preventing customers from coming into contact with potentially malicious ads. "Malvertising and those who perpetuate it have been a huge problem for the digital advertising industry for years," said Randy Wootton, CEO of Rocket Fuel. "Rocket Fuel is committed to the fight against malicious ads and by continuing to leverage outside technologies like Google Cloud Vision API, we can take even greater strides in protecting brands, agencies and consumers." Other features integrated into Rocket Fuel's multi-layered detection and prevention system include the ability to translate the copy from 104 languages using Google Translate automatically. If foreign language ads are hiding malware, detected as trying to push prohibited products or simply click-bait with litte value, it too can be marked as needing a review. Ads flagged as free of malware are approved in seconds, meaning the user experience isn't affected, while those that are deemed as suspicious are then reviewed by humans within hours.

WTF, NYT? 12 Software TensorFlow: I want to like you, but you're tricksy Wrestling with Google's machine learning framework 12 May 2017 at 09:02, Andrew Cobley Hands-on Occasionally a technology comes along that changes the way that people work. Docker has had a profound effect on how applications are deployed in the cloud, Hadoop changed how analysis of big data was done and the R language has disrupted the statistics market. And so to TensorFlow, which emerged from the Machine Learning team at the Google Brain project. Building on their experience of a system called DistBelief, TensorFlow is a second-generation framework for the implementation of machine learning at scale. Users described their ML models as dataflow graphs, combining a number of machine learning techniques into a single model. TensorFlow itself does nothing to reduce the learning curve found in ML (in fact it might make it steeper), but Google's framework does enormously simplify the deployment of ML models. If you think of ML model construction as a data science then TensorFlow is a Data Engineering tool for deployment. Google open-sourced TensorFlow in November 2015 under an Apache 2.0 license with a 1.0 release in February this year that introduced a number of improvements. For example, the TensorFlow had been limited to C++ and Python, but version 1.0 introduces interfaces to Go and Java, and there's a C library for building new language interfaces. What makes TensorFlow so powerful for deployment is its ability to map ML models on to a number of hardware devices and platforms with very little change to the model. The TensorFlow framework will happily run on Android or iOS devices, a laptop, machines with one or more GPU devices to huge networks of machines of specialised machines with many GPU cards. Most ML can be divided into two stages: training a model and running the model to make new inferences from new data. Generally, it is the training phase that needs the most computational power, the model is fed data that has been classified and the model learns (using a number of well-known techniques) features in the data that allow it to identify those features in unknown data. This is called the training phase and is the phase that needs the most power. Once a model has been trained it can be used to infer new facts about data it hasn't "seen before", generally running this inference model takes less power so it can be run on a mobile phone for instance. The bigger the dataset used for training, the more power is required. Luckily TensorFlow scales very well and has built-in support for running training models across large networks of machines. TensorFlow itself will map computation of the model on to the devices it knows are available, be they a local CPU, GPU or remote machines. The algorithm actually simulates the activity on devices to optimise the completion time on the available devices. What is it like to work with TensorFlow? I'm not going to pretend I'm in a position to start writing new ML models on the platform, but – luckily – we may not need to. The TensorFlow webpage contains a link to a TensorFlow Zoo model library on Github with a number of user-contributed models. The zoo has around 27 exhibits at the moment, but it should be pointed out that other user-generated models are available around the interwebz so – for instance – if you want a movie recommendation engine then you could pick TF-recomm from user songgc here. I wanted to see how easy it would be to build my own useable recommendation engine, based on this repository running under TensorFlow. This engine uses a small dataset from the Movielens library here. The dataset consists of rows of data with a user ID, a film ID and the user's rating of the film. The recommendation engine reads this file and makes links between films and users to learn what films a user would like. It's important to note that although the dataset includes details of the films (title, year, genre and so on) this information is not used at all by the model, which only knows users and films by their IDs and the only link is the strength of recommendations. Running the original code was easy, I packaged it into a Docker container for easy deployment on any platform and was able to train the model simply by running the svd_train.py file. The original code trains a model but does not use it for inference. I built a socket interface on to the code that will read a user ID and provide a list of recommended movies. My version cloned from the original is available here. Sharp-eyed readers will notice a number of problems with my code and if you want to run the inference engine you will need to retrain the model. Once the model is trained, it should be saved and then reloaded in an inference engine; this shouldn't be hard to accomplish, but as with all machine learning, it appears to be a black art. Secondly, this version of the code packages only the small version of the dataset, which – even so – takes tens of minutes to train on my reasonably powered laptop. Larger datasets are available from Movielens, but I've not been able to get them to read into memory on any machine. One option may be to use other techniques for reading data into the model but taking the existing code base and extending it is problematic without a deep dive in to the documentation – and that will take some time. Differences in the datasets from Movielens have also caused a number of problems with at least one dataset crashing the learning phase of the model. Not only that, but the problem flagged its presence using an error message that adds nothing to the cause of understanding. Another dataset, meanwhile, terminated the program with a simple "killed" message – and no traceability! Simply making errors more readable and easy to trace would assist programmers just getting started. Saving and reading trained models proved to be problematic, but at least I could see them on disk. Attempts to read them back in, however, have proved fruitless. TensorFlow has much promise. Google's original paper states it has been used in machine vision, speech recognition, playing Go and in language representation. What really sets TensorFlow apart, though, is its graph model that lets end users build ML models out of sets of well-known modelling techniques. In addition, because the inference engine can be run on devices as small as mobile phones, ML could appear on devices everywhere. Yes, even your fridge may one day tap into Google Brain. There's a way to go between then and now, though. Using TensorFlow effectively still requires a deep understanding of ML techniques and how to tie them together into a meaningful dataflow graph. I found the TensorFlow learning curve to be steep – that's without the curve associated with the ML algorithms themselves. ® Tips and corrections 12 Comments MORE Google Machine Learning Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register Google's PHP API client has XSS vulnerability Patch promised Google opens patent pool for Android Protects against trolls maybe.

In a bid to make selfies more exciting, Google has introduced a new feature in its messaging app, Allo. The tool combines AI with the work of artists to turn selfies into custom emoji stickers. Users can snap a quick photo of themselves, and it will automatically be transformed into a cartoon, with customisation options to help personalise the avatar further. Scroll down for video  In a bid to make selfies more exciting, Google has introduced a new feature in Allo that combines AI with the work of artists to turn selfies into personalised stickers HOW DOES IT WORK?  The new Google Allo feature combines neural networks with the work of artists to turn selfies into personalised stickers. Users can simply snap a quick photo of themselves, and it will automatically be transformed into a cartoon character. And if you aren't happy with the character you're assigned, you can go in and personalise it, choosing different hairstyles, skin tones and nose shapes. The new feature uses an algorithm to pick out features in selfies in a similar way that humans do, before importing illustrations drawn by an artistic team. In a blog announcing the update, Google said: 'To create an illustration of you that captures the qualities that would make it recognizable to your friends, we worked alongside an artistic team to create illustrations that represented a wide variety of features. 'Artists initially designed a set of hairstyles, for example, that they thought would be representative, and with the help of human raters we used these hairstyles to train the network to match the right illustration to the right selfie.

'In some instances, they determined that some styles were not well represented, so the artists created more that the neural network could learn to identify as well.' Rather than aim to replicate a person's exact appearance, the feature uses a lower resolution model – similar to emoji – to create a fun character. Rather than aim to replicate a person's exact appearance, the feature uses a lower resolution model – similar to emoji – to create a fun character The first pack of cartoon features have been designed by artist Lamar Abrams, but Google hopes to work with other artists to create to different styles  And if you aren't happy with the character you're assigned, you can go in and personalise it. Google said: '[The] customization feature includes different hairstyles, skin tones, and nose shapes. 'Aesthetics are defined by race, culture, and class which can lead to creating zones of exclusion without consciously trying. Raters were asked to classify hairstyles that the icon on the left resembled closest. Then, once consensus was reached, resident artist Lamar Abrams drew a representation of what they had in common 'As such, we strove to create a space for a range of race, age, masculinity, femininity, and/or androgyny.' The first pack of cartoon features have been designed by artist Lamar Abrams, but Google hopes to work with other artists to create to different styles. Google said: 'The Allo team is working with a range of artistic voices to help others extend their own voice. If you aren't happy with the character you're assigned, you can go in and personalise it with different hairstyles, skin tones and nose shapes 'This first style that launched today speaks to your sarcastic side but the next pack might be more cute for those sincere moments. 'Then after that, maybe they'll turn you into a dog. 'If emoji broadened the world of communication it's not hard to imagine how this technology and language evolves. What will be most exciting is listening to what people say with it.'  This feature is starting to roll out worldwide in Allo today for Android, and will come soon to Allo on iOS. HOW DOES ALLO WORK?  Allo accesses Google's smart assistant, which uses the firm's neural networks and search engine. It allows users to chat with friends and workers, and has a new feature called 'shout' allowing users to change the size messages appear depending on how important they are.  It also predicts responses to posts, and even pictures by analysing what's in them, and has Google's assistant built in. This allows the app to use Googe's search capabilities to access the assistant when booking restaurants, using OpenTable to make bookings, for instance.   Read more: Research Blog: Neural Network-Generated Illustrations in Allo Share or comment on this article e-mail 13 shares Most watched News videos Video shows parents fighting with students at Knight High School 'He's a showboat, grandstander' Trump slams Comey in NBC interview Thugs attack motorcyclist in attempted robbery stopped by helpers Cruel teen girl puts pet rodent in microwave to 'cook it' Giant mystery sea creature washes up on remote beach in Indonesia Cyclist climbs rail crossing moments before high speed train passes Bodycam captures the moment police fatally shoot stabbing suspect GRAPHIC: Shocking moment Mexican soldier 'executes suspect' Horrific 100mph motorbike crash after drivers pull wheelies Paddle-boarders surrounded by great white sharks Theresa May describes being motherless as 'sad' in LBC interview 'My country is the greatest country': Man rants at Muslim family Can pandas get any dafter… or cuter?

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses.

Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats.

Other investors in the round included The Yard Ventures, a Harvard alumni venture fund, and Silicon Valley Bank, which provided debt financing. Sidecar has raised $26 million in less than three years. Press Release Sidecar has completed a Series C round of equity and debt financing totaling $11 million. New investor Harbert Growth Partners (HGP) joined previous investors Ascent Venture Partners and Osage Venture Partners to lead the round. Also participating was The Yard Ventures, a Harvard alumni venture fund. Silicon Valley Bank provided the debt financing. This Series C round brings Sidecar’s total financing to $26 million in less than three years. It also marks HGP’s first investment in a Philadelphia-based company. Sidecar will use the funds to further develop its technology solutions—Sidecar for Google Shopping, Sidecar for Facebook Dynamic Ads, and Sidecar for Bing Shopping—to meet retailers’ evolving marketing needs. The SaaS company will increase headcount by 40% by the end of 2017 to support product development and market expansion. It will draw heavily from the Philadelphia area, emphasizing growth of its engineering and data science teams, as well as its customer success, partnership, sales, and marketing teams. Guided by founder and CEO Andre Golsorkhi, Sidecar has emerged as a key tool in retailers’ e-commerce marketing stacks. Based on advanced machine learning and deep data science expertise, Sidecar’s technology powers shopping campaigns on Google, Facebook, and Bing, and is scalable to meet the demands of emerging channels. Since Sidecar’s $8 million Series B financing 18 months ago, it has more than doubled the size of its customer base, which now includes Moosejaw, Vermont Teddy Bear, and others on the Internet Retailer Top 100. The company also expanded to the SMB and international markets, with organizations including wehkamp, the Netherlands’ largest online retailer, adopting Sidecar. The company doubled headcount over the past year to support this growth, sourcing the majority of talent from the Philadelphia region while also establishing a U.K. team. Sidecar has developed new technology partnerships to further build out its capabilities. These combined factors led the company to triple recurring revenue year over year. “Sidecar is driving online product advertising into the future,” said Tom Roberts, General Partner of Harbert Growth Partners. “The company continues to reimagine what’s possible with artificial intelligence in retail, and its solutions have been validated by brand-name retailers across the U.S. and abroad. We are confident Sidecar will keep building on its established leadership position, and feel honored to be a part of its success.” One of the reasons retailers and investors alike value Sidecar is the surging growth of online retail. The National Retail Federation forecasts online retail will grow 8-12% in 2017, up to three times faster than the growth of retail as a whole. This trend indicates continued opportunity to capitalize on the online product advertising market. Google remains the largest media owner in the world, attracting $79.4 billion in ad revenue in 2016. And last year marked a major tipping point in retailers’ AdWords budgets: For the first time, retailers allocated more spend to Google Shopping ads than text ads (53%). “For online shopping to become the mainstay of retail, merchants and consumers need to better connect where the online shopping experience begins—the product discovery stage,” said Golsorkhi. “Machine learning and artificial intelligence are poised to make this massively complex challenge much easier, enabling retailers to better understand consumer behavior and predict buying patterns, while creating relevant, enjoyable experiences for shoppers. With our continued dedication to machine learning technology, our customers, and our people, Sidecar is positioned to deliver this critical advancement to retail.” Press Resource Associated blog post by Sidecar founder and CEO Andre Golsorkhi: https://hello.getsidecar.com/blog/sidecar-closes-11-million-series-c-investment-round About Sidecar Sidecar is an e-commerce marketing company that builds the advanced technology retailers need to optimize cross-channel online shopping campaigns.

Hawkins and Rich McCormick May 12, 2017, 3:07am EDT share tweet Linkedin Photo by Carl Court/Getty Images The legal case brought by Alphabet’s Waymo against Uber for allegedly stealing self-driving car secrets is set to go to trial. Judge William Alsup, presiding over the case, denied Uber’s request for arbitration on Thursday. That means the case will go to court, but the judge also recommended that the case go to federal prosecutors to investigate whether Uber is guilty of theft. The US Attorney still has yet to accept the case, but if it does and Uber is found guilty, it could face criminal prosecution. Waymo filed the explosive lawsuit in late February, claiming that Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer and current vice president at Uber, had stolen 14,000 confidential documents — or 9.7 gigabytes of data — before leaving Google. Among the documents were trade secrets and patents, including Waymo’s proprietary LIDAR system, the company claims. Uber had tried to force the case into arbitration According to Waymo, Levandowski used the stolen technology to entice Uber into buying his self-driving truck startup Otto for $680 million six months after it launched in 2016. Uber called the allegation “baseless,” but recently was forced to admit that Google’s self-driving technology was superior to its own. (Levandowski recently stepped aside as head of Uber’s self-driving car unit.) Breaking: Alsup is referring the case to the US Attorney for a trade secret theft investigation pic.twitter.com/7QQpFOn9oD— kate conger (@kateconger) May 12, 2017 Uber’s argument hinged on a clause in the contract between Levandowski and the company, which said that any future cases between Uber and the engineer’s former employer should be settled in arbitration. But Waymo instead brought the case against Uber, while filing a separate case for arbitration against Levandowski over allegedly poaching Google employees. The judge struck down Uber’s approach, saying that Waymo was within the law to pursue the case outside arbitration. “Defendants have repeatedly accused Waymo of using ‘artful’ or ‘tactical’ pleading to evade its arbitration obligations by omitting Levandowski as a defendant,” Alsup said. “These accusations are unwarranted.” The US Attorney may not pick up the case “Waymo has honored its obligation to arbitrate against Levandowski by arbitrating its claims (concerning employee poaching) against Levandowski. Its decision to bring separate claims against defendants in court was not only reasonable but also the only course available, since Waymo had no arbitration agreement with defendants,” the judge wrote in court documents. Alsup also noted that Levandowski’s exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights “has obstructed and continues to obstruct both discovery and defendants’ ability to construct a complete narrative as to the fate of Waymo’s purloined files.” Waymo responded favorably to Alsup’s decision, indicating that it would continue to keep up the pressure on its rival. “This was a desperate bid by Uber to avoid the court’s jurisdiction. We welcome the court’s decision today, and we look forward to holding Uber responsible in court for its misconduct,” a spokesperson said. It’s not clear yet whether the US Attorney will indeed take up the case, or whether Uber would be found guilty in a criminal case, but it wouldn’t be an ideal situation for a company that has found itself in hot water lately in both the courts of law and public opinion.

X Wild Geese: the Tipperary man drawing the map of Sydney Oliver Morrissey developed an app that has been described as the Google Maps of underground utilities Fri, May 12, 2017, 07:45 Eimear McGovern Catherine and Oliver Morrissey with Emma Hannigan, host of the Irish Australian Business Awards         Oliver Morrissey developed underground mapping app Utillix after years working in construction and is now developing his buisness from Syndey. After leaving school before his Leaving Cert to start work in the construction industry, Morrissey has now developed an app that has been described as the Google Maps of underground utilities. Morrissey, who grew up in Golden, Co Tipperary, spent between 1992 and 2001 working his way up from machinery operator to supervisor as he worked in the US and Australia. He had just sold his property in Boston when 9/11 took place. “I was 26 at the time and I was actually in the air flying between San Franciso and Boston that same weekend.” When he moved home, he met his wife Catherine and by the time they married in 2008 and had baby Eabha, he was working for BAM Civil. When a management restructure took place, they decided it was time for the family to make a change. “We could see everything was going downhill. We decided instead of having enough money just to survive, we’ll take our redundancies and make a new life for ourselves in Australia.” A new opportunity After leaving snowy Ireland in 2011, the Morrisseys touched down to 38 degree weather in Sydney. Catherine, a primary school teacher, secured a position in a private school while Oliver went to work for his brother, who had his own well-established company Athassel Excavations. “I worked away for a few years up until 2013 when I got the idea for Utillix,” said Morrissey. He describes Utillix, an underground mapping app, as a vision of what is underneath your feet in the construction industry. “When you’re planning construction, you might get seven or 10 different drawings for all the networks you’re going to come across, and then you have to shuffle through all of them and figure out where each one is. What we do is overlay the entire lot on Google Maps and colour code everything so you can put your finger on your phone or iPad and it will give you the information,” he said. “How we do that is we contact the local service provider, for example the water, gas or telecoms company, and we’ll put it all together in an easy to understand view.” Utillix, which has five directors including Oliver and Catherine, operates project by project from an office in Bondi Junction. Companies and homeowners will have their drawings for their property and the option to have a public or private view. Eventually, Morrissey said they will have a complete map of Sydney. The app is free to download from iTunes, Windows and Android and is also available via a web portal. Utillix has received help from Google and is now backed by IBM. Utillix also has projects in Perth, Brisbane and Melbourne. Utillix Inc has also been established in the US, with three companies in Massachusetts. Utillix Ireland is based in Thurles under managing director John Hanafin. “We’re setting up in Singapore and we’re talking to utility providers at the moment. Tiong Sing is one of our contractors that’s using our product, they’re one of the biggest contractors in Singapore,” said Morrissey. The Irish connection Oliver Morrissey said he can’t stress enough how much of a help the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce has been. “They’ve got a great mentoring programme and they’ve put me in touch with an Irish construction leader over here. The business culture is great because everyone helps each other. They’ve really got behind us because they see there’s something global that can come from our product,” said Morrissey. Morrissey is also in contact with utility providers in Ireland. “We’ve been talking to Dublin City Council and the utility providers and there is a major appetite for what we’re doing. The UK is another market as well where there’s been interest so we’re dealing with that at the moment.” The Morrisseys will soon be back in Ireland for six weeks as part of a trade delegation coming to Dublin with the Irish Australian Chamber of Commerce. Oliver Morrissey said the only thing he has to contend with when moving between countries is the accent. “When I go to construction companies back in Ireland, I have the same conversations with them that I would have here. It’s just you’re dealing with Aussies over here and it’s a different accent, whereas you’re dealing with your own in Ireland.” The new land of opportunity Australia is the new land of opportunity and there’s no reason for anyone not to have a job, according to Morrissey. “I looked at the local paper just this afternoon to see the job opportunities out here and there are so many, in hospitality, construction, secretarial, business.” His advice for anyone looking to make the move to Australia would be to get up early and do your job, and not to stay out all night drinking. For Oliver and Catherine Morrissey, Australia is the place where they built their business and will bring up their two children. “We’re firmly settled in over here and Ireland is probably our second home but this is our base.       Topics: Wild Geese Catherine Morrissey Dublin City Council Utillix Australia Singapore Sydney Read More Wild Geese: ‘I have been angling towards this position all my life’ Wild Geese: ‘UK businesses have had really good experiences with Irish staff’ Wild Geese: Mike Cleary, COO Australian Energy Market Operator ‘Nothing is wasted’: chef Robin Gill goes for sustainability over style Playing in the big league of US university sports Wild Geese: Donn Holohan, designer and architect, Hong Kong Grafton Group says UK business on track despite Brexit Builders face insulation ‘headache’ amid key chemical shortage Precision Electric Ireland goes into liquidation with €4.3m debts CRH executives defend pay at shareholders’ meeting  Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Economy IMF warns help-to-buy scheme adding to property pressures Economy A resurgent Franco-German led EU is Britain’s nightmare Education Christian Brothers agree to transfer lands worth €100m Gaelic Football Jim McGuinness: The Border rivalries are needed, especially in Leinster Sponsored Truth serum: how serums won a place in our beauty regimes The Story of Home: A dream of tiny houses The Story of Home: Light and shade ‘I’m still taking it 20 years on and loving it’ Commenting on The Irish Times has changed.

Previous reports suggest that the company may unveil three new Pixel smartphones by the year end. The phones are speculated to be named  Pixel 2,  Pixel XL2 and XL 3. They are likely to come with codename Muskie, Walleye and Taimen respectively. This time, the mystery Pixel device Taimen has been allegedly spotted on GeekBench giving the world some details on possible specifications of the new phone. According to the benchmark report, Taimen could come with Google's upcoming Android O which is somewhere pretty obvious. The report shows that Taimen is powered by a Qualcomm octa-core processor clocked at the speed of 1.90GHz. The benchmarking results given in the report show that the device scored 1804 in single-core test and 6248 in multi-core test. The motherboard configuration is mentioned as taimen. Also, the report clearly mentions 3.5GB storage which hint that the device may most likely come with 4GB RAM. This could be the most expensive one out of the three upcoming Pixel devices and may also boast bigger screen than Walleye and Muskie. Also Read: Google working on a smartphone bigger than Pixel XL: Report About the other two phones, past rumours suggest that Muskie which is the codename for Pixel 2 and is speculated to be a successor of Pixel XL. The device is expected to come with an improved camera hardware than the previous Pixel phones. The main focus of the Pixel XL successor's camera will be its low-light photography. Also the device is expected to ditch the 3.5mm audio jack. The upcoming Pixel 2 is rumoured to be powered by Qualcomm's latest processor Snapdragon 835 chipset. Walleye is tipped to be the smallest of the three Pixel devices that Google may launch this year. Walleye and Muskie are expected to be the second-gen smartphones while Taimen could be a third-gen device. The three phones are expected to come with premium metal finish and boast of a waterproof body.

(Photo: Andrew Neel) By Peter Teffer Brussels, 12. May, 08:43 French and UK citizens have been asking Google to remove links to personal information in increasing numbers, while this so-called right-to-be-forgotten has become less popular in the 26 other EU member states. Meanwhile, citizens who receive a rejection from Google, still rarely make use of their right to appeal. Dear EUobserver reader Subscribe now for unrestricted access to EUobserver.

(Photo: freestocks.org) Google has been forced to offer EU citizens the option to request that certain personal data is hidden from search engine results, after a landmark ruling by the EU's Court of Justice, three years ago this week. The 13 May 2014 ruling said that EU citizens have the right to ask search engines to remove links to personal information which is “inadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant”. The removal process has become known as delisting. The onus for action was put on search engines like Google. Only if the company refuses a request, can citizens appeal with their national data protection authority. Google publishes the number of requests it has received on its website, but only provides cumulative figures. To make a comparison between two time periods since the court ruling (the first period is 16 months long, the second is 19 months long), EUobserver downloaded the data for each EU member state in September 2015. This website found that in the more recent period, the monthly average of requests has gone down in 26 of 28 EU member states. The finding seems plausible because it is likely that those citizens most worried about certain personal information, would have invoked their right-to-be-forgotten in the first months after the court's ruling. However, the number of requests saw a sharp rise in France and the UK. According to a calculation of Google's data, Google received on average 8,473 requests from France in the past 19 months, compared to half that number in the 16 months before that. The monthly average from the UK was 3,529, up from 2,511. Google did not respond to a request for a comment, neither did the French data protection authority CNIL. One reason for the French spike could be that the French data protection authority has been in a public row with Google about whether Google should include non-French domain names, like Google.com in its delisting. Initially Google only wanted to delist information from French citizens from Google.fr, but in February 2016 it succumbed to CNIL's pressure. A spokeswoman for the British data protection authority, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), said she did not want to “speculate” about the reason for the increased number of requests. But while requesting Google to remove information has become more popular in the UK, the number of people who approach ICO to appeal a rejection by Google, is still very low. Since May 2014, ICO received 967 requests to delist information, only a drop in the ocean compared to the 107,429 requests Google has received. Google denied 39 percent of the link deletion requests. That means just over 2 percent of UK citizens whose request was denied by Google appealed. Rejected by Google? Few appeal This low appeals rate is in line with findings EUobserver published in 2015. It emerged that very few Europeans who receive a rejection from Google, appeal to their national data protection authority. In most member states, no more than 2 percent of those who received a denial from Google appealed. Calculations by this website showed that this appeals rate has somewhat improved, at least in the countries that sent specific figures: Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Hungary, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the UK. However, the appeals rate still remained very low. Of these, Spain was the country where appealing to the data protection authority was most common: citizens did so in 3.5 percent of the cases, up from 1.7 percent. In the other countries, the appeals rate was between 0.3 percent and 2.5 percent. Reluctance to contact a state body One reason why citizens do not appeal may be that the perceived threshold to request Google to delist information is probably much lower than to write to an official government body. Martin Husovec, assistant professor at the Tilburg Institute for Law, Technology and Society told EUobserver in 2015 that we should not assume all requests sent to Google are “legitimate”. “It makes perfect sense that the number of follow-up requests is significantly lower, because applying to a state authority forces a citizen think twice whether his or her situation is really in need of this kind of strong remedy”, Husovec said. That assessment is substantiated by data published on Thursday (11 May) by the Dutch data protection authority. It said that in the past three years, it assessed 155 requests to delist. It decided not to mediate between the requester and the search engine in almost half of those cases (70), because it said the company had made the right assessment. Awareness Another reason may be a lack of awareness. In 2015, experts said that both Google and the European data protection authorities should do more to make citizens aware of the fact that the ultimate authority on the right-to-be-forgotten is not Google, but their national data protection authority. As of next year, the national data watchdogs will be legally required to raise awareness about EU citizens' data rights. The general data protection regulation will come into force on 25 May 2018, and it includes an obligation for data protection authorities to “promote the awareness of the public on risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data”. So far, most of the data protection authorities raise awareness only by making information available on their website. But that may not be enough. A 2015 Eurobarometer poll showed that 61 percent of respondents did not even know their country had a public authority in charge of protection their personal data.

Google Contacts 2.0 includes a cleaner UI and changes to contact management [APK Download] Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/11 1:53pm PDTMay 11, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 146 Share on Facebook 56 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Applications Downloads Google News The Google Contacts application really hasn't changed much over the years - after all, it just has to store contacts. Last year the app was updated with a hamburger menu and the ability to merge duplicates. Now Google has released version 2.0 of the Contacts app, with more design improvements and changes to how contacts are sorted. New design Contacts 2.0 has several minor interface tweaks all over the place, which address a few gripes I (and likely some of you) have had with the application. The actual list of contacts looks the same, but the slide-out menu now features an account switcher.    Left: Contacts 1.6; Center, Right: Contacts 2.0 Previously, the app would show all contacts from all your synced Google accounts together. Now you can easily keep contacts separate, or still combine all of them if you want. Another noticeable change is on the contacts themselves - the user icon has been reduced to a small circle instead of covering the top half of the screen.   Left: Contacts 1.6; Right: Contacts 2.0 There are a few other changes on the contact pages. The menu has removed the option to link a contact, but it has a new 'Move' item that moves contacts to another Google account. The edit button has also been moved to a floating action button. Other changes Moving on to the app settings, you can now choose which accounts to use when exporting contacts. Contacts 2.0 also supports Android O's notification channels, with a single channel called 'Notifications' (really helpful name, I know).   A quick look at the APK code reveals that this channel is used for export status notifications. I'm not really sure what the point of implementing Notification Channel support is if your app only has one kind of notification, but props to the Contacts team for getting a head start on Android O support. Finally, there is a new splash screen when you open Contacts for the first time: It basically just tells you that the app will automatically back up your contacts, which might not have been immediately obvious to people using Android for the first time. APK Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Grey Corbin, please. You have to rip Google for this. It's inexcusable. Someone needs to put pressure on the company for their ridiculous UI beliefs. Wasted space galore, circular images for the sake of circular images. This is the peak of their insanity. We used to rip Google for their UI issues all the time. Now they are trying, but that doesn't mean we no longer criticize them. Look at this! I still remember the Nexus 4 announcement, when they introduced this version of Contacts. They praised the big, beautiful, high-res images, and the fact that the new camera could capture them. Now it's five years later and we've gone in the complete opposite direction? Please, someone at AP step up to the plate. Filipe Santos Yup, the overall changes are very good but that wasting space is so bad.... They try at least like Corbin said morteum Why are these tiny contact pictures becoming a thing? Filipe Santos People are starting to use glasses 😂😂 Jimk4003 I think it's because a lot of contact photos are low Res images synced of social media that look awful when blown up to fill half a screen. A smaller photo might not be as dramatic, but at least it isn't a pixelated mess. At least, I assume that's the thinking behind it. Corbin Davenport Yeah, blurry contact photos were a constant problem with the old design. Though, a tiny icon that takes up almost as much space isn't much better. Mochen Liu But you can change a high res photo yourself if you cam't stand it... I have high res photos for most of my contacts. Grey Blurry contact photos are only a problem if you don't care about your contact photos. And if you don't care about them, then you aren't interested in fixes. Savage Alien I remember some of this being Google's fault. A while back, before the whole Material Design era, There was inconsistent syncing between web and mobile and somehow resulted in low res version of the images being synced even when you used high res images since the servers would keep low res copies for thumb nails and things. tismondo Has this problem been fixed? It definitely happened to me - I stopped bothering managing my contact photos because I got tired of blurry versions syncing across every time I replace my phone or flash a ROM. Sashank Narayan Yes, it has since been fixed. I haven't had the issue in a few years now. Elizabethmgamble Google is paying 97$ per hour!

EDIT: OH MY GOD, YOU ACTUALLY CAN! catalysto Actually, you can do exactly that. Maxr1998 Yeah, just found out myself. Everything ok then 😜 Willie Chalmers III At least Google followed their material design guidelines in the original layout. The newer layout is a true waste of space. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for cute doggie pic. http://livewallpaper.info/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/cute-dog-wallpaper12.jpg JacobTheDev I honestly prefer the old one, never had an issue with "wasted space." It's not really wasted, it's a design decision, and I think it's effective in that it treats the contact as a person and not just a bunch of random data; it helped to identify who's contact information you where looking at. I hope this doesn't affect how phone calls come in... Chris Wachtman I really prefer the old design on the left. I set decent photos for my frequent contacts, and I enjoy seeing them prominently displayed. Anyone else use the Contact homescreen widget? Alfredo Hernández Exactly, it would suck big time if they gave the Phone app the same treatment. incognito27 I wouldn't call the left one a waste of space. It actually looks nice. There is nothing wrong with it. The right one though. Ooohooo. The circular icon seems pointless. Winston This is why I like Samsung's Contacts app. It displays a tiny circle like the version 2.0 one if the image is low res, but displays a half-height full-res image like the earlier build if it has an HD one. Which you can swipe down to view in its entirety. Fruity101079 Seriously, this is so stupid. Why selling big screen phones if it's to have ridiculous tiny pictures!!?? If people have blurry pictures, that's their problems. A lot of us took time to use "high res" pictures for all our contacts. And we have to deal with people who doesn't care.... >:( F4LL0U7 I was hoping the Contacts app would bring in the recently-removed feature from Google+ that allows you to keep your contacts up to date, using your contacts' linked Google accounts and downloading that info into your own Contacts app. Since they removed that feature from G+, when I got a new phone I had to download an old version of G+, sync contacts, and then update G+. Another gripe I have about Contacts: every time I reset my phone, the contacts that I previously merged (before resetting) become unmerged and I have to do it all over again. Michael Tran I think it just pulls automatically now. I added a new contact and entered in their gmail and it pulled the photo automatically. The option is gone from G+ but it still did it anyway. F4LL0U7 Pulling the photo always worked, but linking with G+ pulled in all other info, like address, phone, etc. as well. Michael Tran Ah okay. I understand now. cadtek91 This also took away the ability for the phone to download your own photo for the User account photo in the quicksettings drawer. Savage Alien I've never liked having a blank user picture, and each time I wiped my phone I'd be frustrated having to remember how to get mine to show up. Always surprised this was a feature "buried" in Google+.... and now it's gone? No other way to have your google photo to show up? F4LL0U7 Can you believe that?! The only other way is to manually select a photo yourself. There doesn't seem to be any other way to pull in your Google profile pic, other than installing an old version of G+. Disqusman Yup...only realised that yesterday when I reset my Nexus 6P. Sux. I manually set a photo...but I may download an older version of G+ to get all the contacts to sync. cadtek91 Not that I know of. You could manually add the same photo but eh. F4LL0U7 I hate that! That's the main reason why I grabbed an old version of G+, so I could have my profile pic show up. Phil Worst decision ever. I see I'm not the only one who keeps an old Version of G+ around for that exactly. Downloads at APK Mirror must have gone up quite a lot :D F4LL0U7 I should probably do that too. Now that I think of it, I have no idea which version I download. Which version is it? Tiuri Elvander If you add a picture to your Allo profile, this picture shows up in the quick settings drawer. cadtek91 I have an Allo picture, but still no user picture. YouNex Merging contacts has always been a mess, it never syncs properly. Just copy any additional details and remove the other doublons, keep only 1 per each contact. It's manual but more fail-proof Ben Godfrey This used to bug me too. I think if you merge contacts via the new web interface (the pretty material design one, not the old Gmail-looking one), it will sync the changes across everything. It's been a while since I've had to merge duplicates, though -- somebody let me know if this is incorrect. F4LL0U7 Cool thanks, I'll try that! Carson Saldanha Finally none of those low-res, blown up contact pictures. Savage Alien Haven't had that issue in years. Carson Saldanha It's mainly with those people who use low-res pics for their Google account. Savage Alien I'd take fuzzy photo over this new design. I have maybe one low res contact photo and I picked it myself for nostalgia reasons. Cameras on phones are only getting better, too, so this isn't a great excuse to use going forward... (and even much older phone would likely take passable photos) Luzandro Haven't seen this for a long time, but even if this is a real problem for some people, there are better ways to solve it. For example I've seen a dialer/contacts app (don't recall the name) where some sort of dots effect was applied to low res images, which made them look quite nice actually roberto.elena Can the contact names still be edited using multiple fields like name prefix, first name, middle name, etc. or is it all one field now like in the new web version? Tiuri Elvander Customising which groups show up doesn't work for me. People from other groups are still shown in the list. Martins Nkem Looks like the Samsung contact app.. Good job Google Kurt Gomez Can't link contacts across accounts anymore Mochen Liu I love the yuge portrait design... why google? why?... Savage Alien Terrible design. Haven't updated my Phone Dialer app either because they made the same change to it months ago. Bewear It's... ugly. Tim Harman Can you pick which photo to use from the multiples available in a merged account? It annoys me no end I can't pick the really lovely photo of my wife, instead of just the lovely one Google picked. It used to be a feature, then it went away somewhere. Trevor Hawk They also removed the ability to customize which contacts to display in settings Corbin Davenport Are you sure? It's still there for me. Trevor Hawk Yep. It's gone for me. https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6dKMVDga-L9MkwxZGJDUVJBLW8 Alfredo Hernández Damn, that's weird. I definitely still have it on mine. Tiuri Elvander In your first screenshot there an option "contact to display". Surely that's what you want??? Trevor Hawk Thats a screen shot of the older version Tiuri Elvander Ah, my bad. That's very weird. 2 Men-E I much prefer the large contact picture... whispy_snippet Same. Disqusman Agree 100% YouNex Whiter =/= cleaner, this isn't some sort of effing clothes King_Android This might the first time ever I will wait for an update to be forced upon me with a Google app. 😱 jcopernicus I can honestly say the contact portraits are great use of space. Not some soul less list of information. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4a682a8e0c801948117beab20317cc0df2b2d6bac2c85d9ac535412608edc9f.png Ygor Cortes The new contact page with the ridiculously small picture looks disgusting. The old one was much better. Oh Google... Ygor Cortes I'm glad that I don't use Google Contacts anymore for a while now! Timothy Bracken It looks like your blocked numbers are now part of the contacts app. Does this mean that blocked numbers are now backed up and restorable? I can't test this since I don't have a 2nd device. Grey Does Contacts have a Personal Profile yet that is stored on the web? How does Google not have that in 2017? Corbin Davenport It does if you go to settings and tap 'Your info.' Grey That's a local profile. It's not available on the web. In the Gmail app, when I ask it to add my email to contacts, it can't see my "Your Info", and it instead looks for a contact entry. It doesn't exist. Android is 8 years old and does not have this option. Tiuri Elvander Your Google+ profile??? Winston Being a Google app, I'm surprised it's not already on version 89.7 JG I have a cross-platform upgrade that involves Contacts I'd love to see Google make... Google made a comment about their commitment to helping improve online security [probably in an article talking about their use of HTTPS helping to encrypt the majority of web traffic]. I'd like to see them step this commitment up. They're working on a key server that's supposedly more focused on linking the key to a particular profile (to ensure the key belongs to the person claiming its theirs). I'd like to see Google launch the service. Create a new app that allows us to either create a new key or upload an existing key. Update Contacts to link to the key server database and automatically pair contacts with their corresponding public keys (if a match exists). Update Android Messages, Hangouts, Allo, GMail, et al to automatically encrypt any outgoing messages to contacts with public keys. Then even non-technical people can begin using encrypted messages. All it'd take is to download an app, tap a button or two and bam. Disqusman My God! Who made that decision to go with the tiny circular image?! The large contact picture is so much more beautiful. I really dislike how they changed the UI in the dialer to the small contact picture as well :/ ast00 The new contact page with the tiny picture and lots of wasted space is a step back. Shailesh Kumar Is it only exclusive to pixel devices? How can I have this on my moto x style? Daan Smit Guys, I am just not able to display contacts from a number of Google contact groups and my outlook contacts. I can only see my outlook contacts if I either opt for viewing all candidates or only outlook contacts. This also happens on the standard OnePlus3t contacts app. It used to work on Marshmallow though. Is this an Android issue? Exalm It seems they're getting rid of cards and shadows everywhere in favor of simple lists.Flat notifications and quick settings (Nougat), flat dialing screen, flat app drawer in Pixel Launcher, flat Play Store My Apps screen, and now flat contact page. What next? :) Cakefish I'm planning to replace my Galaxy S7 with the Pixel 2 this year because I usually prefer Google's UI, but in this case I actually prefer Samsung's contact app UI: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/55ecc6c4c968731fab76e21b370c08aeaf4c2fce79c88314a96bbbf54656503b.png Alex Rusinov How do you link / merge contacts now? Selecting multiple contacts doesn't provide an option to merge only to share. Also I can't find "link" feature anywhere, only "unlink" Zachary Dunn Cleaner? You mean they got rid of the colorful highlights and made it into another white/gray bland app. They could have scaled down the image a bit to take less space. But a full hero image looks much better than a huge gray space with a tiny avatar iamakii I'm liking this cleaner look and interface Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Anker discounts some of its highly rated Bluetooth speakers and headphones by up to 40% 2017/05/12 4:44pm PDTMay 12, 2017 2 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 20 temporarily free and 4 on-sale apps 2017/05/12 12:11pm PDTMay 12, 2017 36 [Deal Alert] T-Mobile and LG running 'buy one, get one' promo for LG G6 2017/05/12 9:51am PDTMay 12, 2017 40 [Update: Official] T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/12 8:35am PDTMay 12, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 114 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 106 Share on Twitter Total Shares505 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Marcelove It doesn't matter... Google's employees are paid to keep an eye here at AP ... But it must be chimpanzees, because even with the clear feedback about stupid decisions they got here, they still don't give a f*ck and keep the screw route. Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. global etest You can keep it easily by icon packs.. sklatigre Didn't know icon packs can change the notification icons also. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Mr. DICKHEAD it was always a mess.. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense SavageJeep What is Android Market? /s Salis Before Google Play branding, the app store used to he simply called Android Market. NooSH it looks like crap and i'm glad they are getting rid of it. Berkay So you prefer a simple triangle over a shopping bag? It looks horrible lol. TheDrunkenClam Completely agree. Google's whole ad campaign about Android was "be together, not the same". And then they make literally all of their icons the same by putting them in boring white circles. All in an effort to copy apple. I love the different sized and shaped icons of Android. Not a good look, Google. Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Martin Let me read the article for you: "It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate." Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png Exalm ОМГ. Это именно в новой версии вот так? Captain_Invisible That's your crazy language's fault. Vitias R. No it's not. Have a nice day. thunderqus Only if I can find what you are talking about in English and posting screen in "who knows which" language. Vitias R. It says "Update your apps right today". I think that "Обновить все" is enough. Konrad Krawczuk Why it is not something like "обновить все" ? YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af. Really Google? WTF? Maybe just go back to HOLO then? DragoCubed The new icon is nice but the icon in the notification bar isn't so nice. The one thing I don't like about losing the bag is the icon not representing a store. xyz OMG! TRIANGLE! NO CIRCLE? Like if you don't give a flying F about icon shapes. LOL I want circle, niggа! LOL New icon! Fuсk YEAH! Paul Teale Not circular then, not really following their own guidelines are they Kieron Quinn The round icon is round, the non-round icon is not. They're following their guidelines just fine Erimaru What about round icon? Curt I actually like this icon the most. Martin Spierings I already got complaints from people that didn't identify the play store or play icon with app store. So how the hell would this help people? They should realize that most people don't understand the connection google is looking for. Play is used for movies/film or games, not apps. The bag-background at least gave some indication on what to expect. The new one will get lots of people (those not really experienced with Android or mobile in general) to get their apps from there. These things should be self explanatory. And Google should drop the Play name (plus icon). Its a stupid name already. avnow well I used to get this icon pack, not exactly but close to this with an icon pack, this icon looks crisp! //moumon Meh.. I'm still using Elta icon pack :v That's one of the reason why I love android... Customize to meet your expectations <3 jcopernicus Awesome. A play button for purchases! Makes sense! Ra1nb0wD4sh DE Press Start to shut down Windows. :D (Not relevant anymore, I know) Ruben Tavano On the lateral menu the apps section was in the old green and with this update it has been updated to match the new green of the whole play store Alexander Reddicks The icon has been updated to support the new "adaptive" icon style being showcased next week. https://developer.android.com/preview/features/adaptive-icons.html Mr. DICKHEAD This is dumb theres nothing new I like the bodybag version.. but the naked one alone? seriously..?! David Onter The new icon looks HUGE next to the others. It doesn't seem to follow the spacing guidelines? Marcelove Google' employee : "Let's change an icon the people are used to and know for many years to something that doesn't improve anything." Google's executives : "Genius!” Biga173rd They can't make up their minds. madmaglio Finally. I've been replacing the bag icon with my own version of this for years. so much cleaner. VirtualWave I kinda hate it, it looks overly large and gaudy. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d5821ea6199d4b4d1b5b7fa7fb41a252ab810c809090eb00f133b88f741b1735.png Follow Android Police 1.49M 468k 143k 115k Latest Deals 0 [Deal Alert] Anker discounts some of its highly rated Bluetooth speakers and headphones by up to 40% 2017/05/12 4:44pm PDTMay 12, 2017 2 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 20 temporarily free and 4 on-sale apps 2017/05/12 12:11pm PDTMay 12, 2017 36 [Deal Alert] T-Mobile and LG running 'buy one, get one' promo for LG G6 2017/05/12 9:51am PDTMay 12, 2017 40 [Update: Official] T-Mobile to offer 'buy one, get one' deal on Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus starting tomorrow (May 12th) 2017/05/12 8:35am PDTMay 12, 2017 17 [Deal Alert] Get the LG Urbane 2nd Edition for $171.99 on eBay 2017/05/11 8:04pm PDTMay 11, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

You can tell not just by their design but by their specs and price as well. You’d expect the next gen Google Pixels to be just as well, but the story might be a bit complicated than that. For one, there is believed to be three, not just two, Google Pixel 2 models. For another, one of those three, codenamed “taimen” has shown up on Geekbench bearing underwhelming numbers. According to the benchmark, the Google taimen will have a Qualcomm octa-core processor running at 1.9 GHz max. It will also have 4 GB of RAM. It scores a 1804 on the single-core test while on the multi-core test it gets 6248. Not exactly topnotch results. That puts into question the expectation that the Google taimen will run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835. Compare that to the 1929 and 6084 scores that the Galaxy S8+ got in the single- and multi-core tests, respectively. Or the recently leaked OnePlus 5 scores of 1963 and 6687. Those are definitely way ahead of what the Google taimen is showing. So what gives? Given those numbers and the clock speed, there is a distinct chance that the Google taimen is running on a mid-range processor, something like the Snapdragon 653. That would, in turn, support some speculation that claims one of the three new Pixels would be a mid-range variant. Then again, the benchmark could be running the taimen device at the lowest possible clock speed, which would be strange for a benchmark test. That could explain away the disappointing numbers. Either way, we’re still months away from finding out the real deal.

The judge late on Thursday temporarily blocked a limited part of Uber's driverless-car program, which Google alleges benefited from the stolen trade secrets. The motion issuing a partial injunction was sealed. As a result, the scope and details of the injunction - and how drastically it would curb Uber's program - was unclear. Alphabet's driverless-car unit, which Google recently renamed Waymo, had asked the judge to block much of Uber's work on self-driving cars.
