Office life is better than ever before, but dissatisfaction is rising Mon, Jan 23, 2017, 05:30 Lucy Kellaway Companies are trying hard to make staff happy in their jobs, but it’s not working. Photograph: iStock         The boss of a friend recently gathered all his charges together for a ritual new year pep talk. “Each of you has the right to love your job,” he told them. She thought this was terrific and looked a bit dashed when I pointed out it was both dangerous and unrealistic. No one has the right to love their jobs. Not only that, most people hate them. If you type into Google “my job is –” the search engine predicts the way your sentence is going: “so boring” or “making me suicidal” or “ making me miserable”. If you start “my boss is –”, Google offers: “lazy”, “ is bullying me” or (my favourite) “a cow”. Even more alarming, if you type “my job is stimulating”, it assumes you have made a typo and suggests what you must have meant “not stimulating”. The internet has a way of whipping up bad feeling. Yet in this case, workplace disaffection is real and growing. We are in the middle of what Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic, a professor at UCL in London, calls an “epidemic of disengagement”. Most surveys show less than a third of workers care for their jobs, and the long-term trend is getting worse. In the UK, there is some evidence we like our jobs a good deal less than we did in the 1960s. This is most peculiar. I was not in the workforce in the 1960s. But I was in the 1980s, and can confirm things are better than they were back then. When I joined the City, pre-Big Bang, it was stuffed with upper-class men in pinstripes, many of whom were astonishingly dim. Getting criticism to deliver at work Making learning practical for small business owners Wild Geese: For PwC accountant, the way is clear in Fog City Jobs were still for life, so if you landed one you did not like, you were trapped. Promotions took ages, and even then were largely based on Buggins’ turn and who you played golf with. Bullying was so normal no one thought to complain. Office buildings were dingy, dirty and uncomfortable. There was no such thing as ergonomic chairs, and you were likely to get lung cancer from all the passive smoking. ADVERTISEMENT Miserable Now, not only are offices bright and beautiful, we do not even have to go to them if we do not feel like it – we can work at home instead. Bosses have been taught not to shout. There are gyms and free fruit. And if you happen to be a woman, things have improved beyond recognition. In the 1960s you were limited to filing and shorthand, while now (at least in theory) you can run the show. So why are we so miserable? The most common reason is having a bad manager. But this is a puzzle as managers are surely less hopeless now than they were half a century ago. All those MBA degrees, mentoring, coaching and training, none of which existed 50 years ago, cannot have been entirely in vain. Part of our modern disaffection may be due to job hopping. Because we can leave at the drop of a hat, we are less likely to make a go of wherever we are. If everyone is constantly coming and going, no one ever feels secure or has any sense of belonging. But the biggest reason for unhappiness is that we expect too much. Office jobs may have improved, but our expectations have far outstripped them. Better education has not helped. People with university degrees tend to dislike their jobs more than people without them. And so, as more people have degrees, unhappiness rises. As we march up Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, it is harder to enjoy the view from the top. Disaffected Things are made worse by the well-meaning actions of the companies themselves. Faced with a disaffected workforce, they insist it is vital for us to be happy. They trumpet their values. They tell us they are changing the world. They demand we are all not merely engaged, but passionately so. They encourage us to volunteer at good work, all in the name of meaning. The result is not happiness. According to new research from Sussex university, when done crassly this sort of thing makes workers unhappier and more disenchanted than they were before. The corporate obsession with happiness is part of the cause of our unhappiness. When everyone around you is claiming to feel passion or to have found meaning, or when managers say you have a right to love what you do, it is only natural – at the smallest hint of boredom, or after a minor run-in with a manager – to conclude that your job makes you suicidal and your boss is a cow. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2017       Topics: Tomas Chamorro Premuzic Google London(GB) United Kingdom Read More Search for mentors can produce stellar results Rejected at work: Should I stay or should I go?

HTC's Android Wear Smartwatch Caught in Live Pictures GO This is the second set of photos showing the wearable device Jan 23, 2017 05:21 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google debuted 2017 with a couple of Android Wear-related announcements, which suggests the search giant plans to focus on the development of the new ecosystem for wearable devices in the first half of the year. With the launch of Android Wear 2.0 around the corner, many companies announced their support for the new OS with the launch of new smartwatches. Even Google is supposed to launch its own Android Wear 2.0-powered smartwatches, which will be built by LG. We reported about these Google smartwatches last week, as we learned that the Watch Sport and Watch Style would be announced on February 9, at the same time Android Wear 2.0 is set to be officially released. Now, a new set of pictures showing the rumored HTC Halfbeak smartwatch have just been published on Weibo, the Chinese alternative to Facebook. This is the second time we get to see HTC's smartwatch after the gadget leaked online last October. HTC Halfbeak The circular form factor that we already knew from the previous pictures is confirmed once again, along with the two buttons placed on the right side of the smartwatch. According to the latest rumors, HTC Halfbeak should pack a small display with 360 x 360 pixel resolution. The smartwatch is made in collaboration with Under Armor, which is why the logo of the accessory company appears on the back side. The pictures show that the smartwatch is running Android Wear 1.0, but if HTC plans to launch it this year, we can safely assume it will ship with Android Wear 2.0 right out of the box. Unfortunately, it appears that HTC is still assessing the smartwatch market, so it's unclear whether or not the Halfbeak will be made official anytime soon. Our best bet would be an announcement at Mobile World Congress, but HTC fans shouldn't get their hopes too high.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (13 Images) #Android Wear 2.0#HTC Halfbeak#HTC smartwatch#LG Watch Sport#wearable device subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it HTC Halfbeak (13 Images) 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news TAG Heuer Connected Defies Report of Smartwatches Being Unpopular, Sales Triple LG Watch Sport and Watch Style Are Google's First Android Wear 2.0 Smartwatches Android Wear 2.0 Confirmed to Arrive in Early February HTC’s Halfbeak Smartwatch Running Android Wear Leaks in Photos New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3216755 Apple in Trouble As More Buyers Get the iPhone 6s Instead of the iPhone 7 LeakedSource Website Goes Dark Shazam Adds Three App Shortcuts for Faster Song Recognition on Android Phones LG Files Patent Applications for Foldable Smartphones Alcatel to Announce Five New Smartphones During MWC 2017 Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast 13 photos    HTC Halfbeak new android apps Brave Browser APK: Updated January 27th, 14:13 GMT Signal APK: Updated January 27th, 14:10 GMT PokeAlert - Notification for Pokemon GO APK: Updated January 27th, 14:08 GMT SmartThings Mobile APK: Updated January 27th, 14:07 GMT Newsroom APK: Updated January 27th, 14:03 GMT United Airlines APK: Updated January 27th, 14:01 GMT Reddit APK: Updated January 27th, 13:56 GMT Reader comments Motorola Files Patent for Iris Scanner, Could Be Featured on Moto Z 2017 more on: Motorola i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Google Rolls Out Instant Tethering Functionality to Pixel and Nexus Devices GO Introduced as part of the new Google Play Services 10.2 Jan 23, 2017 05:01 GMT  ·  By Andrei Vlad  ·  Share:  Google has silently pushed a new feature to Nexus and Pixel devices that is called Instant Tethering. It's a slightly more advanced implementation of the standard tethering functionality, which is supposed to make the process of setting up connectivity using this feature much easier. The new Instant Tethering feature has been implemented as part of Google Play Services 10.2, so if you own a Nexus or Pixel device and haven't yet updated to this version, then you won't be able to benefit from it. It's also worth noting that some Nexus and Pixel devices that have already been updated to Google Play Services 10.2 don't have the new Instant Tethering feature enabled, but you can check for it by heading to the settings and Google menu. According to AndroidPolice, with the new feature, Nexus and Pixel devices will automatically set up a new tethering connection without having to make any special settings. Nexus 6P It looks like Instant Tethering can connect devices that are associated with a Google account, thus making it easier to stay online when the connection drops. Basically, whenever the connection drops, the phone will ask you whether you want to tether to another device associated with your Google account or not. If your answer is “yes,” then you won't need to make any additional changes, but keep in mind that the feature uses Bluetooth to negotiate the connection, so make sure it's enabled. Instant Tethering also allows users to see the battery level of their other device. Google hasn't yet announced anything related to Instant Tethering, but it looks like the new feature is being pushed to Nexus and Pixel devices that are powered by Android 7.1.1 Nougat operating system. Moreover, the Nexus 9 and Pixel C are supported as clients only, which means these devices can connect to compatible phones. The new feature also allows two phones to connect to each other if one of them loses its connection.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (2 Images) #Instant Tethering#Android 7.1.1 Nougat#Nexus phone#Pixel XL#tethering phone subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Photo Gallery (2 Images) 01 02 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Says Fix for Known Audio Issue Is Coming Soon to Pixel Phones Audio Issue on Pixel Phones Is Hardware Related, Google Says Nexus 6P Units Affected by Early Shutdowns Following Android Nougat Update Google Pixel Audio Problem Can Be Fixed by Flashing Custom ROM New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3216755 Apple in Trouble As More Buyers Get the iPhone 6s Instead of the iPhone 7 LeakedSource Website Goes Dark Shazam Adds Three App Shortcuts for Faster Song Recognition on Android Phones LG Files Patent Applications for Foldable Smartphones Alcatel to Announce Five New Smartphones During MWC 2017 Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast 2 photos    Instant Tethering feature new android apps Brave Browser APK: Updated January 27th, 14:13 GMT Signal APK: Updated January 27th, 14:10 GMT PokeAlert - Notification for Pokemon GO APK: Updated January 27th, 14:08 GMT SmartThings Mobile APK: Updated January 27th, 14:07 GMT Newsroom APK: Updated January 27th, 14:03 GMT United Airlines APK: Updated January 27th, 14:01 GMT Reddit APK: Updated January 27th, 13:56 GMT Reader comments New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels more on: MWC 2017 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

Image Credit: Screenshot Google has integrated part of the Explore feature of Google Maps into its core web search. It recently came to desktop Google Search results after arriving first on mobile devices, where the Explore feature made its debut in 2013 as part of Google Maps. The carousel-style widget appears under the heading “Discover more places” and showcases eight or nine categories of places that are relevant to your search. For example, when I search for “fried chicken,” the new feature in search results display photos and names of restaurants under the categories “Best spots for lunch with kids,” “Chicken and waffles,” “Chicken restaurants,” “American restaurants,” and so on. Clicking on one of these results on desktop takes you to a Google Maps-like interface showing the places in a column on the left and on a big map on the right — from there you can select individual places to see in more detail. But these pages are located at URLs that begin with https://www.google.com/search, as opposed to https://www.google.com/maps. On the mobile web, after tapping one of the categories, you see a stack of cards of places, along with pictures you can swipe through — a stripped-down implementation of Explore in the native Google Maps apps. The feature rolled out to desktop earlier this month, after hitting the mobile web in October, and it’s visible for searches about things pertaining to food and drinks for people using U.S. English as their default language, a Google spokesperson told VentureBeat in an email. “Google is committed to helping people find the most up-to-date, comprehensive, and useful information, so they can make the best decision on where to go. And we’re always working on new ways to help improve that experience for our users,” the spokesperson wrote. Above: What you see if you click one of the categories surfaced in “Discover more places” from Google Search on desktop. Image Credit: Screenshot Google has taken steps to enhance Explore in Google Maps over the years. In 2015, the Explore portion of the Android app was revamped with a new look and a more granular discovery mechanism, and similar improvements came to Google Maps for iOS in 2016. “Discover more places” typically appears at the bottom of desktop search results and near the bottom on the mobile web; sometimes above it there is other content sourced from Google Maps, such as nearby places plotted on a map and listed immediately below. That Google would show multiple representations of Google Maps content in Search suggests that the company simply wants to figure out what works best. Google might well end up blending the map and list with the option of highlighting collections of places à la the Explore/Discover more places feature — but for now, there is overlap.

It is getting harder for web users to tell the difference between trusted websites and malicious content, according to a developer working on Google Chrome. In a blog post, Google engineer Eric Lawrence said that it helps to think of browsers having a “line of death” between pixels controlled by the browser and those that are under the control of a website and therefore subject to manipulation by a malicious actor. “In web browsers, the browser itself usually fully controls the top of the window, while pixels under the top are under control of the site. I've recently heard this called the line of death,” he said. “If a user trusts pixels above the line of death, the thinking goes, they'll be safe, but if they can be convinced to trust the pixels below the line, they're gonna die.” Lawrence added that this crucial demarcation isn't explicitly pointed out to the user, and worse than that, it's not an absolute. He cited an example where chevrons are used to cross over this line of death so that the browser can show extra information, such as if a connection is secure. Phishers, while not being able to cross this line, can fake something like this that touches the line and most users will fall for a fake chevron and notification which can be clicked on to serve up malicious content. But a bigger problem, as far as Lawrence is concerned, is that some attacker data is allowed above the line of death, such as an icon and page title, which is in control of the attacker, as it's the attacker's domain name in the address bar. Lawrence said this may consist entirely of deceptive content and lies. Another problem is the web content. “Nothing in this area is to be believed. Unfortunately, on windowed operating systems, this is worse than it sounds, because it creates the possibility of picture-in-picture attacks, where an entire browser window, including its trusted pixels,” he warned. He said that even defences such as using a custom theme (as this would show up a fake window in default colours) wouldn't protect users against such attacks. Such attacks have rendered Extended Validation (EV) certificates pointless as they can also fake a green padlock, used for denoting validated sites. Lawrence said that his favourite mitigation technique for this kind of attack was a proposal that browsers should use PetNames for site identity. “Not only would they make every HTTPS site's identity look unique to each user, but this could also be used as a means of detecting fraudulent or mis-issued certificates (in a world before we had certificate transparency),” he said. However, the line of death has all but gone with the advent of HTML5-based browsers as this allows fullscreen windows without any address bar or chrome. He said that the Metro/Immersive/Modern mode of Internet Explorer in Windows 8 suffered from the same problem; because it was designed with a philosophy of “content over chrome”, there were no reliable trustworthy pixels.  “I begged for a persistent trust badge to adorn the bottom-right of the screen (showing a security origin and a lock) but was overruled. One enterprising security tester in Windows made a visually-perfect spoofing site of PayPal, where even the user gestures that displayed the ephemeral browser UI were intercepted and fake indicators were shown. It was terrifying stuff, mitigated only by the hope that no one would use the new mode,” he said. He added that virtually all mobile operating systems suffer from the same issue. “Due to UI space constraints, there are no trustworthy pixels, allowing any application to spoof another application or the operating system itself,” said Lawrence.

It hopes to cooperate closely with a hardware manufacturer to launch a device priced US$300 or less in the first half of 2017 this year. This new handphone will be part of Google’s “Android One” programme. The program first debuted in India in 2014. Google is asking those involved in the Android One program, more specifically, their manufacturers to produce devices that will adhere closely guidelines so that a pure Android experience will be what users receive and there won’t be any unnecessary customizations or bloatware. Google will support its manufacturers with ad campaigns to help with sales too. Budget phones though, are everywhere now. There isn’t a shortage of them at all. Telcos regularly give off low-cost smartphones and pretty much every company has a cheap device you can get for $100-$200. However, these devices are often subpar in quality with horrible hardware and outdated Android software. Furthermore, most manufacturers customise the user interface of Android to give their phones a unique look and feel. This gives each company’s phone a signature look, but it comes at the cost of bloatware. Personally, I find the stock Android look much more appealing. In addition, Google doesn’t like this kind of customisation as it undoes some of the work that the company itself has spent trying to design Android, and also because these various tweaks by manufacturers hinder the update process across Android OS phone.   Leave a comment SCAN THIS QR CODE WITH YOUR PHONE Close Next Post Microsoft To Ship Their Mixed Reality Headsets This March Related Post Another alleged LG G6 image crops up online Just a few days back, we saw the very first image of the upcoming LG Related Post New leak reveals complete specs of the upcoming Samsung Galaxy S8 In a new report published on Venture Beat earlier today, smartphone leakster Evan Blass detailed Tags Android Android One Google Google Pixel HTC Samsung smartphone © 1999 - 2016 VR Zone AP Pte.

However, there's a catch for those interested in using the feature.  ( Andreas Proschofsky | Google+ ) Advertisement Google has started to roll out a new feature for Android devices that will allow users to remain connected to the internet when their connection is lost. Named Instant Tethering, the feature that is part of Google Play Services 10.2 makes it easier for users to utilize their Android devices as mobile hotspots. How Does Instant Tethering Work? According to a post by Austrian journalist Andreas Proschofsky on his Google+ account, when instant tethering is activated, Android devices with no internet connections will be offered to go online by sharing the data of other smartphones and tablets. The device that would like to go online and the one that will be sharing its internet connection should be linked to the same Google account, with the negotiations of the connection facilitated through Bluetooth. It is very easy to use the feature, as once the initial set-up of the user agreeing to use it has been completed, there will be no further set-up necessary for Instant Tethering. A prompt will simply appear on the screen of the device with no connection asking if the user would like to connect to a mobile hotspot that will be created by a linked Android device. However, the prompt also warns that the device that will function as the mobile hotspot will use cellular data, will use up its battery quicker, and will disconnect from any Wi-Fi networks that it may be connected to at the time. What's The Catch? Instant Tethering sounds like a feature that will be very useful for people who own several Android devices, but with only one or two of them having access to mobile data. However, Instant Tethering is currently in a limited rollout. According to Android Police, the feature is being launched first for Pixel and Nexus devices that are being powered by Android 7.1.1 Nougat. The Pixel C and Nexus 9 are also being granted the feature, but will be limited to being clients that can connect to the mobile hotspots offered by other Android devices with Instant Tethering. The Pixel C and Nexus 9 will not be able to function as mobile hotspots, but they will be able to connect to mobile hotspots created by the feature even if they are still on Android Marshmallow. Android Police added that there is a server-side component to Instant Tethering, so compatible devices which have installed Google Play Service 10.2 might not see the feature appear right away. For these devices, it is recommended to have them restarted as that might do the trick of launching the feature. When Will Instant Tethering Roll Out To All Android Devices? Google has not issued an expected date for Instant Tethering to be rolled out to all Android smartphones and tablets. However, as the feature continues to be tested on Pixel and Nexus devices, more Android devices should start seeing the Instant Tethering option. Users with non-Pixel and Nexus devices should keep checking Google Play Services every once in a while to see if the feature has arrived on their device.

Amazon and Google always thrive in the fourth quarter as people get out their wallets for Christmas. Both companies – or in Google’s case, its parent group, Alphabet – are therefore expected to announce booming revenues in their fourth-quarter results over the next fortnight, with Alphabet going first on Thursday and Amazon the following week. But analysts are already looking beyond the simple question of how many cardboard boxes Amazon filled and how many searches Google answered. They’re wondering which company will win the battle to control your home. That battle is being fought by two carafe-sized cylinders from the respective companies. One is Amazon’s Echo, with its voice-operated “personal assistant”, Alexa; the other is Google Home, which responds to the phrase “OK Google”. Both are internet-connected, home-based devices which can be command to do things: give the weather forecast; play music; read out news headlines; update shopping lists; and control “smart” devices in the home such as light bulbs or power points. In theory, if a device can be linked to it, the Echo can control or monitor it, and keep you informed. And simply by saying “Alexa, add sugar to the shopping list”, users can keep up to date on house supplies and even purchase them directly. Amazon is in the lead, having launched the Echo in November 2014, two years before Google Home came out. Though Amazon has not – and does not – release sales figures for any individual item, investment bank Morgan Stanley estimates that 11m Echos had been sold by the end of November 2016; other estimates suggest a further 7m have been sold since. About 700,000 were estimated to have been sold in the UK and Germany, the only countries outside the US where it is available. The Morgan Stanley estimate would put an Echo in more than 8% of US households. This is a significant figure, especially compared with the best estimates for Google Home, which put its sales at less than a million since its launch in October 2016. Why should Google care about Amazon? Because voice is seen as the next big field for computer interaction, and the home is a far better environment for voice detection than the great outdoors. Research company Gartner reckons that by 2018, 30% of all interactions with devices will be voice-based, because people can speak up to four times faster than they can type, and the technology behind voice interaction is improving all the time. The risk to Google is that at the moment, almost everyone starting a general search at home begins at Google’s home page on a PC or phone. That leads to a results page topped by text adverts – which help generate about 90% of Google’s revenue, and probably more of its profits. But if people begin searching or ordering goods via an Echo, bypassing Google, that ad revenue will fall. And Google has cause to be uncomfortable. The shift from desktop to mobile saw the average number of searches per person fall as people moved to dedicated apps; Google responded by adding more ads to both desktop and search pages, juicing revenues. A shift that cut out the desktop in favour of voice-oriented search, or no search at all, would imperil its lucrative revenue stream. Amazon is copying one feature of Google’s success in smartphones: it is offering methods to connect and control smart devices via the Echo for free, rather as Google’s Android software was offered as a free platform for smartphones. There are signs it is paying off: Wynn hotels in Las Vegas announced in December that it would be adding Echos to all 5,000 rooms, for functions such as playing music and controlling curtains and blinds. That gained some notice, as much as anything because the life cycle of such hotels implies they will be there for a decade or so. Similarly, at January’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), also in Las Vegas, commentators were struck by how many devices incorporated Alexa. And Amazon is even stealing into Google’s territory: some phones sold in the US from China’s Huawei, which uses Android, will incorporate Alexa rather than Google’s Assistant programme. Google’s natural reaction is to have its own voice-driven home system, in Home. But that poses a difficulty, illustrated by the problems it claims to solve. At the device’s launch, one presenter from the company explained how it could speak the answer to questions such as “how do you get wine stains out of a rug?” Most people would pose that question on a PC or mobile, and the results page would offer a series of paid-for ads. On Home, you just get the answer – without ads. What analysts wonder is: how can Home bridge that revenue gap? So far, Google hasn’t explained. Even if it can fend off the Echo, it may not be able to defend its core business. By contrast, the Echo’s benefit to Amazon is much clearer: it can make online shopping (at Amazon) a breeze, play music from Amazon’s paid-for subscription service, and generally act as a passive block on your using rival shopping sites – rather as Google cemented its dominance by being the default search engine on multiple browsers in the mid-2000s. Richard Windsor of Edison Investment Research suggests that time is running out for Google: “It has to act quickly, as Amazon is on the brink of becoming the industry standard for controlling smart home devices. “At CES, everyone was integrating with Echo, with Google Home and Apple HomeKit barely present.” Indeed, where are Apple and Microsoft, which also have their own voice-driven assistants in the form of Siri and Cortana? Although both can be used in the home – Siri on the iPhone or iPad, and to play content on the Apple TV set-top box, and Cortana on the Xbox games console – neither seems to be intent on the “home assistant” market. Phil Schiller, Apple’s vice-president of marketing, seemed to suggest recently that Apple wouldn’t follow Amazon and Google into offering a voice-only device: “Having my iPhone with me as the thing I speak to is better than something stuck in my kitchen or on a wall somewhere.” He also emphasised the importance of a visual display: “We still like to take pictures and we need to look at them, and a disembodied voice is not going to show me what the picture is.” Even so, there are persistent rumours that Apple has prototyped an Echo-like device in secret but is undecided on whether to release it. The company hasn’t commented. It could be ready to unveil something – or may never do so. Microsoft, meanwhile, is in more homes than the Echo via the Xbox, but isn’t trying to make itself a listening device linked to a shop. So, will we all be burbling away to thin air in a few years, asking how long our commute will take while our smartphones sit unused in the kitchen? Perhaps – though Ken Sena, a senior analyst at investment bank Evercore ISI, suggests that home-based voice assistants will never be used as widely as smartphones. According to Sena, they are not such a must-have. Yet, they were a hot Christmas present – and voice interaction is still in its early days, perhaps comparable to the smartphone market in 2005, when BlackBerry, Palm and Microsoft dominated. Or, it could be like the smartphone market now, effectively dominated by Google and Apple. But which? Alexa, can you see into the future?

A Staff Writer It is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations. Photo: Reuters With China making rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI)-based research, it is imperative that India view AI as a critical element of its national security strategy, recommends an August 2016 report titled India and the Artificial Intelligence Revolution. Authored by Shashi Shekhar Vempati of Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the report advocates spurring AI-based innovation and establishing AI-ready infrastructure as prerequisites for preparing India’s jobs and skills markets for an AI-based future and securing its strategic interests. Here are highlights from the report: AI’s potential in India Thanks to the increasingly digital economy, fuelled by improving education and globalization, the Indian consumer is unknowingly the country’s biggest beneficiary of recent advances in AI, notes the report. From utilizing various applications powered by AI to using a range of online services such as Amazon Marketplace and Netflix that learn from consumers’ online behaviour to make intelligent product and service recommendations, consumers are readily engaged with the proliferation of AI in India, whether they appreciate it or not. Policymakers, however, lag behind, not exploiting AI for national security, public services, or other priorities. Indian academics, public researchers, labs, and entrepreneurs face a different challenge than the corporations that dominate the space—the infrastructure necessary for an AI revolution in India has been neglected by policymakers. Why China is stealing a march in AI research While lack of physical infrastructure is certainly a major impediment, India’s AI development also suffers from the paucity of the necessary cultural infrastructure, which is key for recent advances from lab to marketplace in AI. Fostering a culture of innovation and a commitment to research and, most important, nurturing an ecosystem beyond the four walls of the organization are all common to Google’s DeepMind, IBM’s Watson, and Baidu’s Institute of Deep Learning, the most successful AI projects of the past half decade. While it must come as no surprise that Google, IBM, Microsoft, Facebook, and other global technology giants have invested significantly over the decades in machine intelligence, it is the story of Baidu that holds the most pertinent lessons for India. The story of AI at Baidu is the story of Andrew Ng—an associate professor at Stanford University who teaches a popular course on machine learning (also available via Coursera, an online learning platform that he co-founded). Ng was hired away from the Google Brain project in 2014, following which Baidu invested heavily in physical infrastructure. Baidu is investing in deep speech for voice-based searches that leverage speech recognition. This intelligence is being built for understanding and interpreting queries in Mandarin rather than English; as such, Baidu is constructing a uniquely Chinese platform, independent of that which is used ubiquitously in the English-speaking West. This version of AI thus offers the possibility for the development of AI in India, as an example of AI technology successfully developed in and employed by a non-Western nation. Baidu’s investment in AI research exposes the relative backwardness of India’s technological infrastructure: China has recognized the importance of bridging the gap between the lab and the market while nurturing a research and innovation ecosystem unbounded by national borders and corporate firewalls. India, in contrast, boasts neither the material nor the cultural institutions required for such innovation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi often challenges Indian IT entrepreneurs, asking when India will give birth to the next Google or Microsoft. But until India attains the infrastructure omnipresent in the US, and increasingly existent in China, the deep-learning capabilities necessary to address the vast linguistic diversity across India using machine intelligence may prove elusive. AI’s impact on Indian jobs While India dreams of its own manufacturing revolution through Modi’s Make in India programme, it is important for policymakers to closely examine how the advent of industrial robots and their impact on manufacturing transformed companies in other developing nations. Consider the case of Foxconn—one of the world’s largest contract manufacturers for electronics. In 2015, Foxconn made news when its chief executive, Terry Gou, predicted that 70% of all manufacturing in Foxconn’s assembly lines would be automated with robots displacing humans. Some back-pedalling later, his estimate was scaled down to 30%. Foxconn is among the top owners of robotics patents filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and produces thousands of industrial robots a year that in aggregate are capable of performing more than ten types of manufacturing tasks. This is expected to have a significant impact on the workforce: as many as 60,000 workers have been displaced by robots in one Foxconn factory alone in the Kunshan region of China. China was projected to have more installed industrial robots by the end of 2016 than any other country, with more than 30 robots for every 10,000 industrial workers. If China were to increase that density, employment would be further damaged. While the dire predictions of a robot takeover of manufacturing have not come to pass, the reality of automation is that manufacturing is unlikely to create jobs at the scale that it did in the past. Quoting the US Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2013 on future employment projections, Darrell M. West of the Center for Technology Innovation at Brookings highlights how jobs will decline over the next decade in manufacturing and information technology among other sectors. Writing in Pacific Standard magazine, Frank Levy, professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, places jobs dislocation on account of AI in perspective when he dismisses the dire projections of a robot takeover. According to Levy, the greatest area of concern for policymakers ought to be the impact of AI on jobs in the middle-skill category—assembly line workers, clerical workers, and the like. Levy also warns of significant dislocation caused by automation leading to a reduction in an individual’s potential for upward mobility. He emphasizes that a good education will be critical to acquire the necessary skills and to be competitive in this evolved labour market. In their book The Second Machine Age, Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee make several specific policy recommendations for coping with the job crisis likely to be spurred by AI. A key recommendation of particular importance for India, given Modi’s Startup India initiative, is the need to “restart startups”. Brynjolfsson and McAfee view creative destruction inherent within the start-up economy as the best bet for experimenting with the new jobs and industries that can thrive in an AI-driven economy. The authors provide examples of start-ups such as TaskRabbit and Airbnb that contrive previously non-existent economic opportunities for ordinary people with spare time and assets, thus creating economically productive work. Skill development for future jobs Not everyone is as sanguine as Brynjolfsson and McAfee about the coming AI revolution. The recent victory of AlphaGo (a computer program developed by Google DeepMind) over the world champion in Go has prompted fears of the threat posed by intelligent machines that are capable of superhuman tasks. The direst warning comes from noted physicist Stephen Hawking, who apocalyptically predicts the end of the human race with the development of “full artificial intelligence”. In the provocative book Humans Need Not Apply, Jerry Kaplan, an American computer scientist and futurist, explores this and several other questions while attempting to paint a picture of an apocalyptic future and what it might look like if and when machines take over. Specifically, Kaplan raises two issues that should be of interest to policymakers in India. The first is the education system and the second involves skills and jobs. While discussing the likely impact of AI on labour markets, Kaplan poses the radical question: Is the current system of sequential education and work outdated, and does it require an overhaul? In his book, Kaplan also proposes a so-called “job mortgage” as a new type of financial instrument through which employers, vocational schools and colleges would have an incentive to collaborate in a new way. In this proposed job mortgage market, Kaplan attempts to use free market mechanisms to match current skills acquisition to future job opportunities. He proposes to accomplish this by compelling employers to commit to an intent to employ an individual in the future if that person commits to acquire a specific set of skills over a certain time frame. India will have to experiment with the kind of innovative instruments that Kaplan proposes if it is to prepare itself for the challenges from a machine intelligence-driven economy in the near future.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 23 January 2017 Secure your digital life by tan kit hoong Value your data: While many of us can afford to lose our smartphone, we can't risk having our private info stolen. — Reuters Our smartphones and PCs hold a lot of our sensitive data. Here's a guide on how to keep your digital devices safe in an online world Before the Internet, the only way to get a virus on your computer was via the ­venerable floppy disk. With a few exceptions, most viruses in those days were just silly – and relatively benign – pranks that made the PC do weird things. Today, however, the world is a different place – with the rise of e-commerce and e-banking, hackers now have more sinister motives when creating malware, such as stealing credit card details or private information. With almost all our devices connected to the Internet in some way, making sure our smartphones, tablets and computers stay free from malware is like trying to navigate a minefield. We’ve compiled the best tips to help you keep your online life safer – do remember that there is no one solution that can protect you. To stay safe in the digital world, you need a combination of best practices and ­programs. Smartphone security Many of us don’t realise how much private information is stored on our smartphones until the day it’s stolen or lost. A good indication that the online banking site is secure is a little green lock icon which appears next to the URL in the address bar in your web browser. —  TAN KIT HOONG/The Star It not only houses all your online ­transactions but also your private photos and videos, so it’s in your interest to ­protect it by following the tips listed here. Activate screenlock We lock our doors so people can’t come in and steal our stuff, so why doesn’t everybody lock their smartphones with a passcode? If you want to make it more secure, consider using a passphrase with letters and numbers instead of a passcode with just numbers (more later). Even better, if your smartphone has a ­fingerprint sensor, use it instead. It can be a hassle to set it up but you only have to do it once. Most phones will also allow you to turn on a ­feature that will erase the phone after a certain number of unsuccessful attempts – use this with care. Limit your sources If you’re an Android user, you will notice that it will by default only allow you to install apps from the Google Play store. If your smartphone has a fingerprint scanner, you should enable the feature to prevent others from accessing your phone. —  TAN KIT HOONG/The Star If you try to install an app from another source, you’ll be presented with a warning that you’re installing an app from outside the relatively safe confines of Google’s curated store. While Google Play itself is not free from dodgy apps, it’s far safer than third-party sources. By installing apps from a third-party app store, you’re opening yourself up to installing malware unless it’s from a source that you know is safe, like the Amazon App Store. You can check whether you’ve set your Android for installing from third-party ­sources by going into Settings, System, Security and finally Unknown Sources. On iOS, unless you’ve jailbroken it, you only have access to the curated App Store, which is generally safer. Set permissions If you own an older Android that’s running version 5.0 or 5.1 (Lollipop), you’ll notice that whenever you install an app, you’ll get a ­message from the app asking for permission to access stuff, such as your contact list, ­camera or calendar. Most people allow the app to access everything it wants, but it’s worth taking the time to read and understand the permissions it is requesting. For example, while it is logical that the Facebook app will ask for access to your calendar and contacts, something is not right if a flashlight app wants to access your contacts. If you think something is not right, deny the app the permission or don’t install the app. Thankfully, with Android 6 (Marshmallow) and later, Google changed how permissions work. So if you are using a newer Android, apps will only seek your permission when it needs it. This also gives you better control over your apps – you could, for instance, grant an app permission to your contacts but not the ­camera. Whether you are using an old or new ­version of Android, you can always revoke the permissions at any time, by going to the app’s Settings screen. Phishing attacks Phishing (pronounced “fishing”) is, as the name suggests, an attempt to obtain your information like your credit card info or banking login details by “baiting” you. A link is usually sent via e-mail or instant messaging which will take you to a fake website. Nowadays, hackers have become so good at making a fake site look like a legit one that it’s not easy to tell the difference at first glance. So it’s best not to click on the link in the first place, but how do you recognise a ­phishing e-mail or instant message? It’s ­actually not so easy, as some really look like ­legitimate messages. The rule of thumb is to always view any e-mail or message asking you to “verify” your banking or credit card details with suspicion. These messages will also almost always have a link for you to click on. If you want to verify the legitimacy of the e-mail or instant message, it’s better to open the browser and manually type in your ­banking or credit card website so you can log in to your account to check if there are any announcements or discrepancies. At risk of sounding redundant, we’ll repeat – never click on any link in an e-mail that you don’t trust. Another new form of phishing we’ve ­discovered arrives via SMS with the message that you have spent a large amount on your credit card and to call a number if you didn’t make the purchase. Don’t call the number – the scammer is hoping to use clever social engineering tricks to get you to reveal your credit card details. Instead look for the correct number on the back of your credit card and use that instead. Remote device locator If you own an iPhone, you probably know about the Find My iPhone feature – it allows you to locate your iOS device by going to www.icloud.com and logging in with your iCloud username and password. You also have the option of remotely ­erasing your device so your information can’t be stolen. Did you also know that Android devices also have a similar feature? It’s called Android Device Manager and you can find it at www.google.com/android/devicemanager. Android Device Manager gives you the same options as Find my iPhone – you can make your phone ring, lock it up or erase it remotely. Two-factor authentication Two-factor authentication works by ­sending a special login code that you need to enter in addition to your username and ­password – this code is sent via SMS or using an authenticator app. If you are not familiar with the concept, think of it as Transaction Authorisation Code (TAC) or Personal Access Code (PAC) that’s required when making a ­transaction via online ­banking. Two-factor authentication can be turned on for most major websites and services, including Gmail, Facebook, Amazon and eBay. We can’t give you specific instructions because each site has different steps for enabling two-factor ­authentication. For your Google account, you can go to goo.gl/R2xWkg. It may be a hassle, but it’s one of the most effective ways of preventing someone from hacking into your account.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Instant Tethering rolling out to selected devices running on Nougat By Ida Torres - January 22, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Tethering your mobile device is sometimes a very useful thing, especially when you’ve lost a connection and you really, really need the Internet at that very moment. But it takes you basically a few steps to be able to set up your hotspot. It looks like Google may be trying to make it easier as it rolls out the Instant Tethering feature to some of its users, particularly those who have devices running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat as part of the Google Play Services version 10.2. What this feature does is to link up devices that are connected to your Google account to make it easier for them to stay online, even as one device’s connection drops. Using Bluetooth connection, it will ask you if you want to tether to your other device when one of the connection drops. It will also show the battery level of the device, in case you don’t have enough juice to turn on your mobile hotspot. Once you’ve set it up on your settings, there will be no additional steps necessary once it prompts you to connect your device to the other. The Instant Tethering settings section allows you to toggle on/off whether your device will provide data connection or it will get data connection. It seems that for now, the Nexus 9 and Pixel C are supported as clients (will work eve on Marshmallow) while the others like Pixel XL are the hotspot devices. They still seem to be testing out this feature as it is a server side update for now for the Google Play Services 10.2. There are also device and carrier restrictions of course, depending on your plan or data allocation. Go to the main system settings and Google Menu to see if you have Instant Tethering.

Small but magnificently mighty, Polk Audio’s Magnifi Mini is one of best little soundbars you can buy. Highs Powerful punch in a small package Expansive soundstage for the size Brilliant blend between bar and sub Warm and detailed midrange Intuitive and concise design Lows Treble occasionally sounds strident and distorted Only one HDMI input 5.1 surround is more like 3.1 DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Editors' Choice Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Speaker Reviews > Sound Bar Reviews > Polk Audio MagniFi Mini review By Ryan Waniata Posted on 01.21.17 Research Center: Polk Audio MagniFi Mini Polk Audio’s teensy, tiny Magnifi Mini doesn’t look much like a traditional soundbar — more like a sound brick, or maybe a sound stub. Yet, in many ways the Magnifi Mini embodies what soundbars are all about. With it’s forgettable foot print and forceful sound, the Magnifi Mini is a great solution for those seeking no-hassle TV audio enhancement. Add in a price tag of just $300, and this little sound blaster makes a serious case as the small-profile soundbar to beat. Out of the box Pulling the Magnifi Mini from its box lets the unit’s tiny size sink in. Stretching a shade past 13-inches long, the compact capsule looks more like a Bluetooth speaker than any home theater solution we’ve encountered. That said, its hefty weight hints at the array of six drivers and other solid internals within. An included down-firing sub is almost the bar’s exact opposite: Set in a traditionally sized cabinet, the unit strikes an imposing stature compared to its counterpart, yet it’s light as a feather when you pick it up. As a result, this countertop duo is surprisingly portable, allowing you to easily pack the pieces up and take them on the road, should that strike your fancy. Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Bill Roberson/Digital Trends Riding along in the box is a fully loaded IR remote layered in rubberized plastic on top, as well as the necessary power cables, HDMI, Optical, and 3.5mm cables, and a small setup manual. Features and design Small but furious, the Magnifi Mini is also a handsome little devil. Its namesake is no accident, as the unit looks a lot like Polk’s original Magnifi soundbar, squashed by magic hands to better fit your TV stand. While it easily disappears beneath your TV, angular sides and a silver plate set at the center of the unit’s peppered speaker grill make for a tidy and appealing aesthetic. The bar’s 13.4-inch length is matched by a height and depth of 3.11-inches and 4.25-inches, respectively. The Magnifi Mini’s wide soundstage is almost magical in its expansiveness. Beneath the surface are six drivers, including dual 2.5-inch drivers at dead center flanked by a pair of 2-inch drivers at both sides, which are set at an angle to fire off a wider soundstage. The lanky subwoofer stands about 14.5-inches tall and deep, and 7.4-inches wide, sporting a 6.5 inch downward-firing driver. Polk Audio dubs the system as a 5.1 surround solution thanks to DSP and Dolby Digital decoding, but despite offering a much wider soundstage than you’d expect, performance offers a 3.1 experience at best. (More on that below.) Inputs at the back include HDMI with ARC, digital Optical input, and 3.5mm Aux input. The hardwire options are matched by wireless connection in the form of Bluetooth, as well as Wi-Fi connection via Google Cast. The unit’s big sound is due in part to Polk Audio’s SDA surround sound DSP, while Voice Adjust allows you to crank up the center channel for clearer dialog. There’s also a night mode to limit dynamics when the family is sleeping and a choice of three DSP modes for film, sports, and music. Polk Audio MagniFi Mini Compared To Vizio SB4551-D5 Samsung HW-K950 Dolby Atmos Nakamichi Shockwafe Pro 7.1 Yamaha YSP-5600 Definitive Technology W Studio Micro… Monoprice 42-inch Sound Bar Klipsch R-20B Yamaha SRT-1000 Klipsch R-10B Sony HT-XT1 Philips HTB3525B Denon DHT-S514 Harman Kardon Sabre SB 35 Paradigm Soundtrack Energy Power Bar Elite A section of LEDs on the front of the bar indicate volume, bass, or Voice level, while colored LEDs indicate source. Basic controls rest atop the unit’s rubberized control panel, while the loaded remote allows for quick and easy adjustment of bass and voice volume control, basic volume, input, and DSP selection. It’s a simple and intuitive setup, and ARC connection allows your TV remote to take the wheel as well. Setup The easiest and highest-quality connection is done via ARC HDMI, which allows for quality digital sound and helps the system “hand-shake” with your TV’s CEC information, allowing you to control power and volume via your TV’s remote. Alternatively, you can simply connect your TV’s optical audio output, or connect any 3.5mm source into the Aux input. Bluetooth pairing is done by pressing the Bluetooth key on top and pairing on your source device, while connection to Wi-Fi is done via Google’s Cast app. As a minimalist sound solution, the Magnifi Mini doesn’t include multiple HDMI inputs, meaning all HDMI source components must be connected via your TV and, therefore, will rely on your TV to decode the surround sound codecs (unless your TV supports surround sound pass-through). This is not the optimal sounding solution in most setups, but considering the price and size of the Magnifi Mini, we’ll give it a pass — this system isn’t designed for audiophile-grade playback. Performance The first thing you notice about the Magnifi Mini is just how big it actually sounds, especially when it comes to the width of its stereo image. While it certainly doesn’t reach 5.1 stature, thanks to its angled design and some DSP trickery, this unit’s soundstage is almost magical in its expansiveness. You can enjoy constantly surprising those who walk in the room as you divulge the sound source: “That much sound is coming from that little speaker?!” Bill Roberson/Digital Trends It’s not just the wide soundstage that impresses here, either. The near-uncanny balance between the sub and the bar is a sonic partnership made in heaven. The proficiency of any soundbar/subwoofer combo is dependent upon the effectiveness of blending the lower frequencies to mold two distinctive sound sources into one, and the Magnifi Mini’s dual units have this partnership down pat. The sub fills up the bar’s lower midrange brilliantly, allowing for a warm and punchy thump that appears to come from dead center, while the bar is free to fill in the top side with clarity and some impressive detail. The system is at its best playing back basic TV, from your favorite Netflix streams to the NFL playoffs. The sub reaches down into the lower bass with just enough authority to create vibrancy and excitement in the necessary moments, while the bar offers rich resonance in dialog, mixed with some sparkle in the upper midrange that lets through just enough detail to keep you transfixed on the subject at hand. The compact capsule looks more like a Bluetooth speaker than a soundbar. When it comes to powerful cinematic moments, the Magnifi Mini may not be the baddest bar around, but it gets the job done. The fury of fantasy flicks like Peter Jackson’s The Lord of the Rings Trilogy is recreated with plenty of verve — the pounding drums of war, the singing arrows flying through the air, and the thunderous spells of good and evil beings are all well captured, while dialog floats on top with clarity. We did notice a few moments when we had to ride the volume a bit; Softer scenes didn’t have as much midrange presence as we’d like, forcing the volume up, while the action scenes came back in with explosive force that jolted us to lower the volume again. Another quibble we have is a spindly tone in the upper midrange that occasionally borders on distortion. This is especially present with action films pumping at full force, as explosions and other jolting effects tend to cause a little breakup in that sparkly upper register. The same issue affects music playback, washing out crash cymbals, especially on brighter recordings. The Police’s Synchronicity is a particular offender, as Stuart Copeland’s cymbal play is constantly fighting the tips of those small tweeters. Still, as long as you don’t expect audiophile reverie here, the Magnifi Mini is a welcome companion for everyday TV and music playback. Using the system as our daily sound machine for weeks, we were constantly amazed that all that warm, detailed sound was coming from such a tiny system. Our Take Offering massive sound in a tiny package, Polk Audio’s Magnifi Mini is one of the most affordable and intuitive sound solutions in the soundbar genre, and one well worth considering for those looking to improve their TV’s sound without even nudging the furniture. How long will it last The DT Accessory Pack AmazonBasics digital Optical Audio Toslink cable $6.49 AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI cable $8 AmazonBasics 3.5mm Male to Male stereo audio cable $7 Polk Audio is a veteran brand with a solid track record, and the Magnifi Mini’s simple and robust design should make it a stalwart piece of your audio collection for years to come. What are the alternatives While not nearly as compact, Yamaha’s YAS-203 is a go-to soundbar at the $300-400 price point, and a solid alternative. Those looking for richer, more detailed sound — especially for music playback — may also want to look at Pioneer’s Andrew Jones SP-SB23W, though that will likely cost you more. For the moment, few alternatives at this size, price, and quality level exist. Should you buy it Yes. If you’re looking to shrink down your system’s profile, or simply enhance your TV audio with a minimalist solution, the Magnifi Mini is one of the best choices available. Share

Close share panel Media captionAaron Puzey cycled the length of Britain without leaving home. A digital games programmer from Angus is thought to be the first person to cycle from Land's End to John o'Groats in virtual reality (VR). Aaron Puzey did it without leaving home. He used an exercise bike, publicly available images and a smartphone app he wrote himself. He rode more than 900 miles, burning 50,000 calories in the process. Now he's hoping his creation - called CycleVR - will become a commercial proposition. Image caption Aaron pedalled the length of Britain without leaving his living room For a dedicated cyclist, even January can offer some lovely days to go out for a spin but even more excuses to stay in. Aaron Puzey has created the best of both worlds. He knew riding his exercise bike was good for him but staring at the wall was boring. So he set off to pedal from one end of Britain to the other in virtual reality. Image caption Aaron works for a "digital toy workshop" He left Land's End last Spring. Sort of. By the time we met he had spent 85 hours in the saddle, spread over seven months. He was virtually on the outskirts of John o'Groats. Or should that be on the outskirts of John o'Groats, virtually? Because in reality we were in the warmth of his living room in Monifieth. On a TV monitor and in his 3D VR headset, images from Google Street View showed the famous signpost drawing closer. By happy chance the Street View camera had captured a group of people standing at the finish line - a virtual welcoming committee. Aaron whooped as bright yellow letters spelled out CYCLE COMPLETE! Image caption The moment Aaron reached the end of the journey "It feels fantastic," he says. "It's such a good thing after six to seven months of cycling." How did he do it? Physically, by pedalling. A lot. Technologically, he did it by creating CycleVR as an app for his Android smartphone. An inexpensive cadence meter attached to the exercise bike measures how fast he is pedalling. That information helps create moving images from the Google Street View data. These are sent to a VR headset, another component that didn't bust the budget. The CycleVR app tied it all together. Image caption Aaron programmed flying cubes to show him which way to go "It was just a little mobile phone app that I wrote in my spare time," Aaron says. "It probably took me three or four weeks. "Just a little bit of research on how it works - and it came together really quickly." That makes it sound easy, but then his day job is in Dundee's thriving digital games industry. Denki Games describes itself as a digital toy workshop. It has contributed to titles like Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto. Gary Penn, Denki's creative director, says he wasn't surprised when Aaron told him about his personal side project. He says: "You thought, 'I'm surprised nobody's thought of that before'. "Because it was a pretty obvious idea once he'd mentioned it. "But no, not a surprise because he's always making things from things." Aaron's favourite places on his digital journey include Bristol, the Lake District and Perthshire. He took just three wrong turns along the way, overtook four horses and carts and witnessed two men having a punch-up. Image caption Among the sights he saw along the way was this fight Google stitches together its Street View panoramas from 2D digital pictures - so where does the 3D come from? Aaron says enough information is already compressed into the Street View images. CycleVR extracts the third dimension from information that might otherwise remain hidden. Any problems? One common to many VR users: nausea. Aaron found turning corners in VR made him feel sick. The solution was to tweak the app so the moving images "strobed" round corners. The visuals are a bit jumpier but there is a considerably reduced chance of reacquainting yourself with your lunch. The next step will be to turn CycleVR into a commercial proposition. Potential customers may be influenced by some more statistics. The number of steep hills Aaron had to climb? Zero. Headwinds faced? Zero. Crashes, dog attacks, icy roads, rainstorms - in the VR world, not one of them either. Plus, it's always daylight on Street View and you can get off the bike any time and go for a cuppa or nice lie down. Aaron is now inviting suggestions for where in the world he should ride next. Without, of course, leaving Monifieth. Street View certainly offers plenty of scope. To me, Japan looks quite tempting. But only if someone creates an app that will do the pedalling as well.

In May 2016, a man in the US was killed when his Tesla Model S collided with a tractor trailer at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway. Reports of the incident say the driver had the semi-autonomous Autopilot program engaged at the time of the crash, and it was unclear whether the vehicle’s systems didn’t detect the turning truck ahead or whether the driver had ignored safety warnings to re-take control of the vehicle. This week, however, the NHTSA ruled that there was no fault with the vehicle and that the driver had to have ignored safety warnings to maintain control of the vehicle – Bloomberg reports. “The auto industry just let out a giant sigh of relief,” said Dave Sullivan, an analyst at consultancy AutoPacific Inc. “This could have started a snowball effect of letting automakers and suppliers become liable for human error.” Above: Google’s Lexus RX450h-based self-driving car prototype The ruling is not only a win for Tesla but a win for numerous other companies that have invested billions of dollars into autonomous driving systems, including Ford, Google, General Motors and the Volkswagen Group. The rationale behind the push for self-driving vehicles is the belief that eliminating human error will reduce the amount of collisions on the road, thus reducing the number of people killed in traffic accidents every year. Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, said the decision was “very positive”, and made note of the fact the company’s vehicle crash rate had dropped by 38 per cent since introducing its auto-steer system. However, IHS Markit senior analyst, Stephanie Brinley, told Bloomberg it’s far too early to fully trust autonomous vehicles despite the findings. “This decision does not in and of itself tell us what will happen down the road,” she said. “It’s really too soon.” NHTSA spokesperson, Bryan Thomas, added that automatic braking systems and semi-autonomous driving technologies are still not capable of addressing all crash situations. Above: Tesla Model S Since the incident, Tesla has updated its Autopilot system, with Version 8.0 employing a ‘three strike’ approach to prompt the driver to put their hands back on the wheel. The first prompt makes three beeping sounds, and if the driver ignores all three stages of warnings, Autopilot will be disengaged for the remainder of the journey and the vehicle slows down. NHTSA spokesman Bryan Thomas told Bloomberg this week that car makers must go to lengths to plan for drivers that fail to monitor the system and the environment around them. Manufacturers will be expected in future to provide clearer, overt warnings about the limitations of autonomous driving technology. “It’s not enough to simply put it in an owner’s manual,” Thomas said. When the new Autopilot 8.0 software was released, Elon Musk went as far to say Version 8.0 would have saved the life of the man killed in the accident. Do you trust autonomous cars?

Leslie D'Monte AI is a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. Photo: iStock Shivaram Kalyanakrishnan is an assistant professor in the department of computer science and engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay. He specialises in artificial intelligence (AI) and is the only author from India who is part of an 18-member study panel of the Stanford University-hosted report titled Artificial Intelligence and Life. Kalyanakrishnan’s expertise broadly fits in the area of machine learning. Called reinforcement learning, it defines what actions software agents should take to maximize a certain type of reward after learning from reward and punishment. In an interview, he urges people to be more optimistic about the things AI can do rather than be obsessed with the fear around AI machines. Edited excerpts: How was the Stanford AI report conceived? How did you get involved? In the last 5-10 years, the public has been forced to take notice of AI. You do searches, for instance, and get the information you want. You can talk to your phone using Apple’s Siri. There is so much intelligence in your car. Everywhere, intelligent software is assisting you in your lifestyle in a very noticeable way. The common man’s perception is that AI is taking away jobs. Jobs that people used to do about 10 years back have been replaced either partially or even fully in some cases by software and hardware developments. This triggered the conversation, which led to experts being asked about their opinion of where AI is heading and what can be done about it. In the last few months, there have been some alarmist views, even by physicist Stephen Hawking. Moreover, even a person like Elon Musk, who is responsible for taking technology forward with his ventures like Tesla and SpaceX, has expressed similar sentiments—that things could go awfully wrong once we have AI doing actions that human beings traditionally have done. Eric (Horvitz, a computer scientist and technical fellow at Microsoft) has been with Microsoft Research and is primarily responsible for this report. He decided that we needed a more sober assessment of AI—not based on emotions but one that is more rigorous and scientific. We will have a study panel every five years. This is the first one. I was chosen by Peter (Peter Stone, professor at the department of computer science, University of Texas) because the study panel was looking at diversity in age, gender and geography. This came together in May 2015, and we were given a year to do this. As a group, we agreed that it is true that AI is game-changing, that it is moving at a fast pace. Hence, we did not forecast beyond 2030, because it is not scientific to do so when there is so much uncertainty about the concept. Can you list some of these uncertainties? Look back to 1995. I don’t think it was possible way back then to predict accurately some of the things that we have today. The Internet has happened, so have smartphones and social networks. It’s the nature of science and technology which makes it difficult to predict beyond a certain period. There are just too many variables. What was your contributions to the AI report? My contribution was more to define AI. We take intelligence for granted in human beings. We expect people to be able to do certain tasks, to answer questions meaningfully etc. So what are the operating principles that define intelligence? How is it constructed? What are its mathematical foundations? We have asked these questions earlier too, and even in the 70s we had automata (a machine which performs a range of functions according to a predetermined set of coded instructions). For instance, you still have churches where clocks do specific tasks (for example, birds chiming) when their gongs strike midnight. The confluence of software and mathematics really took place in the 1950s when computers became available. We had the Eniac (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) which was built during the war (World War II), and it became possible to build computer systems that could exhibit intelligence. So technically speaking, the first such computer systems were aimed at helping soldiers during the War—used to calculate things like the trajectory of a missile; planning logistics, etc. This explains why DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) has been funding computer science in general and AI for a long time. But the pioneers of AI have also been thinking about AI in scientific terms. Scientists like Alan Turing, who can be considered to be the fountainhead of AI despite the fact that he did not have access to real hardware, was one (such, who was), thinking about writing a programme to play chess. So what exactly is AI? The term was coined only in 1956 in a workshop (Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence) put together by John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester. So you can think of AI as a branch of computer science but it is multidisciplinary: it has constant inputs from psychologists, linguists, roboticists, etc. You know intelligence when you see it. But how do you get an artificial agent to show intelligence? Most people would consider a machine to be endowed with AI if it performs like a human being. You can think of examples like Google search or Google Maps. Computers can play chess, which was the holy grail of AI, and now even beat grandmasters. We think of intelligence as a spectrum that is constantly being propelled forward. And AI is what can do this. In some sense, AI is this desire to replicate intelligence in hardware. It is also, in a strange sense, the sum total of what an AI researcher is doing—something in robotics, NLP (natural language processing), etc. AI does not have a rigid definition. Hence we went with (Nils J.) Nilsson’s definition in the AI report (AI is that activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment). What does the AI concept comprise? The broad architecture of an intelligent agent is one that senses the environment, which does some amount of thinking, and then takes actions in the real world. If you consider sensing, there is the whole area of Computer Vision, which tries to make sense of objects we see. We, then, have the field of speech processing that has to do with audio. When you go to actuation, you have fields like robotics, haptics, etc. AI also comprises machine learning, knowledge representation and logic. Humans typically make changes to their behaviour as they learn from experiences. So if the experience that a programme undergoes somehow changes its behaviour, you can say that the programme is applying machine learning. Now we have data-driven machine learning. Consider the case of hospitals gathering patient data—vital parameters like blood sugar level, age, gender, blood pressure, etc. Now let’s presume the hospital has collected this data for, say, 1,000 patients and diagnosed diabetic patients from this lot. A machine learning algorithm can then sift through this data and learn a predictor and predict whether a new patient (whose body parameters are available) is diabetic or not. Similar is the case with Google search that has moved from also displaying irrelevant links to using machine learning algorithms that have refined this task over the last few years. The technical base for designing machine learning systems comes primarily from streams like probability and statistics. Then we have NLP, which is the most natural. By speaking natural languages that is quite different from the language that computers use to communicate (1s and 0s—bits and bytes), NLP has got to a state when you can take a shot at machine translation. The basic building blocks for NLP comprise actual models of languages. The linguistic hierarchy of language begins with syntax, moving on to semantics (study of relationships between words and how we construct meaning) and later, pragmatics (e.g. you can use sarcasm, puns—typically where you need an understanding of culture and context). Anyone dealing with NLP has to know these branches. What about Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) aim to simulate the human brain. They can be used to map inputs to predictions. There are standard learning algorithms to train ANNs based on data. Neural networks have been around for almost three decades but it was very difficult to train large and deep (with more layers) neural networks. Technically, they get stuck in the so-called Local Minimum (defined as the best solution to a problem within a small neighbourhood of possible solutions as opposed to the concept of ‘global optimum’, which is the optimal solution when every possible solution is considered). Ironically, you do need ANNs with many layers. Deep Learning helps us to successfully train larger ANNs. Will true AI ever be achieved? This has divided researchers over the decades. Most people in the AI community subscribe to the view that it does not really matter if machines are exactly replicating what human beings can do, as long as we do things that are intelligent and of value. For example, we have software that can fly an aircraft—very differently from how a human being would do it but it is doing it nevertheless. What are the challenges? Explaining AI to the public itself is a challenge. That said, can inputs be automatically learnt or combined in ways that can give higher level abstractions, to make the task of prediction easier? In the context of vision, the inputs to computer vision systems is just images (matrix of 0s and 1s). But deep learning algorithms are able to abstract things out like edges, boundaries, locations of objects, etc. You can have a deep learning system to autonomously drive a car. The software agent needs to reason about stop signs, etc., (and) not only about camera images; it has to learn a host of features from scratch. The other challenge is that hardware needs to match the pace of development in software. The brain also uses less energy than the chips that we are building today, which are simulating our neurons using a different architecture that generates a lot of heat. Hence, there is a move to develop specialized hardware using a neural architecture as opposed to the traditional Von Neumann architecture. If this becomes a reality a decade from now, we will be able to do a lot more with neural networks than we can now. Not only does a neural network need to be good at its task, it should also be energy efficient. There is a lot of scare-mongering around AI. What is your perspective on this issue? People are driven a lot by what they see in movies. Part of the common person’s concern is around the Frankenstein that will do nasty things. The fact is that AI is beginning to work in very specialized tasks like controlling an airplane or driving your car. It’s hard to think of any general AI machine that can do all of these tasks in unison—clearly something that humans excel at. As far as AI machines are concerned, this is certainly not on the horizon for at least the next 15-20 years. This scare is unfounded. But the fear that certain types of jobs will vanish because AI (software bots and machines) will do it more efficiently is genuine. Policy makers should prepare themselves for this, and proactively retrain and reskill the people who will be affected to help them cope better with the situation.

How to join the network If you’re not paying attention to what’s going on in energy, you should. We’ve seen this movie before. Spoiler alert: There’s massive economic opportunity ahead. How massive? Imagine standing in 1992, knowing that Google, Akamai, Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, eBay, BuzzFeed and Uber lay ahead. This time it’s the “enernet,” not the internet, that will transform our lives. The story is the same, though the players have changed. Here’s the tee up. Across the country, incumbent network providers operate highly centralized networks in their respective cities. Then, scrappy local outfits start serving the market with innovative, distributed technology. These startups create competition, and a new network emerges atop the legacy network. That was the backdrop 30 years ago when a little thing called the internet emerged. Startups like CompuServe, AOL, EarthLink, Netcom and a host of other local ISPs kicked off the conversion from analog to digital by offering internet access over existing cable and telco networks. Today, the actors are SolarCity, Sunrun and a host of others moving us off fossil fuels and into clean energy supported by smart equipment, services and software, offered atop existing utility networks. This time, it’s the enernet. Enernet. Noun. A dynamic, distributed, redundant and multi-participant energy network built around clean energy generation, storage and delivery and serving as the foundation for smart cities.  Jigar Shah, founder of SunEdison, seeded the enernet revolution more than a decade ago. He devised a breakthrough financing model that made solar affordable and scalable. He’s the Marc Andreessen of this storyline… seminal, smart and strategic. Today, watch Elon Musk. He presented new solar roof shingles to the world a few months ago. Solar that’s affordable and attractive. Plus, he’s integrating it into a game-changing home system with storage and EV charging. Think the world’s first iPhone. Musk’s electric car company, Tesla, is poised to be an enernet giant, the Amazon of this go-around — margin-challenged in its early years, but set to move. Let’s stop acting surprised, and instead start acting. It goes well beyond Tesla. There is a long list of enernet innovators now emerging. They are building nanogrids, microgrids, distributed energy resources and virtual power plants. They are creating new, intelligent building materials and smart lighting. They are deploying new networks and intelligence that are driving down costs and improving services. At heart, the enernet is the foundation for smart-city tech, including the “Internet of Things,” distributed systems, interconnected backbones and networking technologies, EV-charging services and autonomous vehicles, to name a few. These technologies will drive dramatic change and force us to rethink our cities, municipal services and sectors like transportation, insurance, real estate and financial services. From the enernet evolution will come smart cities that are an order-of-magnitude smarter, healthier and safer. The new network will also present quantum leaps in energy security and emergency resilience that can stand in the face of superstorms or cyberattacks. Hold on to your seats. We’re at the early stages of something immense. Still, I hear the seeds of fear and doubt. There is an oft-cited refrain that the transition will cost a lot and take a long time. That’s absolutely silly. We don’t look back at the internet transformation from analog to digital and think, “Wow, that was slow and cost a ton of money. We should have stuck with the typewriter and landline.” Fact is, it was blazingly fast and driven by those who understood the spend as leveraged investment, not cost center. Likewise, the move to clean energy will seem fast and prudent as solar and energy storage continue to scale, smart cities accelerate and prices continue their fall. I also hear “the utilities are in big trouble.” Let’s not be simplistic. Google didn’t kill Comcast. Comcast is doing just fine. The utilities that own transmission and distribution networks (the wires companies) have enormous value and opportunity ahead. There is no way that the transition happens without the participation of these companies, and there is considerable economic upside ahead for them. Forward-thinking utilities — Consolidated Edison, National Grid and others — see what’s coming and are poised to thrive in the enernet world.

It’ll be up to the management teams at these companies to de-risk the future with intelligent investment and acquisitions. Hats off to folks like David Crane, a visionary who worked to drive that transition at NRG Energy. We will see more of that type of leadership again over the next 10 years as market dynamics shift and outcomes become more obvious and urgent to the incumbents. That said, enernet innovation, like innovation in every other sector, is unlikely to originate from within the incumbents. If you don’t believe me, read books like The Innovator’s Dilemma by Clayton Christensen or this article from Accenture that asserts “corporate innovation does not work.” Unless a Lou Gerstner or Steve Jobs is at the helm of an incumbent, innovation will be acquired, not grown. This backdrop presents incredible opportunity for startups and early investors in the space. I’m excited to be part of that, and I hope that talented entrepreneurs turn their attention from the app economy to the enernet. There’s enormous upside. As I said, we’ve seen this movie. Let’s stop acting surprised, and instead start acting. An economic powerhouse awaits the United States. We’ll be thankful we chose to become a worldwide enernet leader, as this evolution creates a new kind of healthy, robust economy.

WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. January 21st 2017 7 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/Technology/ Aussie consumers turned to other Android phones in the wake of the exploding Samsung Note 7 fiasco. Picture: Ahn Young-joon Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM SAMSUNG has officially revealed faulty batteries caused its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire and has announced steps to avoid repeat incidents in the future. The announcement came more than three months after Samsung scrapped the short-lived competitor of Apple’s iPhones, wiping $US5.3 billion off its operating profit in one of the biggest tech failures in history. Investigations by the company and independent organisations found the batteries were the sole cause of the Note 7 fires, Samsung mobile chief Koh Dong-jin told reporters during a briefing in Seoul on Monday. The major headache for Samsung provided a big opportunity for its competitors to gain an edge in the increasingly competitive smartphone wars. Consumer confidence was always going to be rattled by Samsung’s exploding phones debacle, so which companies actually gained from Samsung’s loss? Surprisingly Samsung’s biggest rival, Apple, did not benefit from the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco in Australia as Aussie consumers sought other Android smartphone brands in the wake of the global recall. That’s according to figures released by consumer website Finder.com.au which measured “brand intent” among Aussie consumers comparing smartphones and mobile plans on the market. “We measured brand intent via our mobile phone plan engine, which is a page consumers visit to either switch phones and/or plans,” Finder.com.au’s technology commentator Angus Kidman told news.com.au. “Our data shows Aussies’ first handset preference, reflecting brand intent. This data does not indicate purchases or sign-ups.” This photo taken on September 13, 2016 shows a blown-up Samsung Galaxy Note 7 smartphone in Gwangju, 270km south of Seoul.Source:AFP The 2016 smartphone brand analysis was based on the comparisons of 56,000 Australian consumers who visited the website, he said. From August to September (when the first incidents of the Note 7 catching fire occurred), brand intent for Samsung dropped by almost a third. It moved from 32 per cent of mobile comparisons involving Samsung devices to 23 per cent. It steadily decreased over the rest of the year, finishing at a low of 19 per cent brand intent in the month of December, the company said. That interest shifted from Samsung phones to other Android devices with Google being one of the big winners with the release of its first smartphone. Google brand intent almost doubled among Australian consumers, growing by 86 per cent, according to the analysis. Interest in Huawei doubled, increasing by 101 per cent while Oppo saw an increase in searches by 53 per cent. Apple remained the first smartphone preference for Australians with brand intent sitting at an average of 62 per cent, followed by Samsung at a 25 per cent average in 2016 and all other manufacturers at 13 per cent. However Apple brand intent among Australians remained relatively steady over the year. This graph shows the proportion of handset searchers on Finder.com.au. A clear decline for Samsung is evident from August.Source:Supplied Most Android phones are cheaper than Apple’s iPhone, which is probably why Apple failed to gain a major boost from the Samsung fallout. Mr Kidman also believes Australian consumers are creatures of habit, preferring to stick with a familiar operating system. “For many, choosing a new phone is swayed by the operating system. We’re creatures of habit and like the comfort of knowing our way around our phones. A new OS means figuring out how to do the simplest of tasks like changing your ringtone,” he said. There was also many consumers who reported being underwhelmed by the latest Apple iPhone. “There weren’t many major design changes in the iPhone 7 compared to previous generations, and one of the most notable was also highly controversial: eliminating the headphone socket,” Mr Kidman said. “For someone switching from Android, that could feel like a deal-breaker, especially when there is such a wide range of Android devices to choose from.” -With AAP Jump back to top Right now in technology 182Readers 2016 WF9: Asteroid could trigger mega-tsunami 47Readers ‘This is library’: Trump protest shut down by unlikely sourc... 36Readers Queensland shipwrecks: Four 19th-century shipwrecks found 37Readers Australia Day: triple j Hottest 100 trolled on Facebook MORE IN Mobile Phones Netflix update will frustrate iPhone users Wi-fi to kill mobile black spots You need to update your iPhone Apple’s Siri to become a cricket tragic FOLLOW US ADVERTISE ABOUT US JOIN Please enter a valid email address Legal: Privacy Policy Relevant Ads Opt-Out Cookie Policy Terms & Conditions A NOTE ABOUT RELEVANT ADVERTISING: We collect information about the content (including ads) you use across this site and use it to make both advertising and content more relevant to you on our network and other sites.

Latest Pure Nexus ROM Update Brings Header Options and One-Handed Mode GO The custom ROM can be installed on Nexus and Pixel phones Jan 23, 2017 05:29 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  The Pure Nexus Project aims at bringing stability and new features to Google Nexus and Pixel tablets and smartphones. The idea is to keep “Google’s vision in line” and provide users with a stable ROM with minimal bugs and tested features. The team behind Pure Nexus announced a new update that brings header options and a one-handed mode to Android Nougat users. The latest update is aimed at Android 7.1.1 Nougat users on Nexus and Pixel phones, although some versions can be ported to other devices as well. According to a Reddit thread, the new update brings a feature that allows users to change the header background and adjust other elements as well. Users can change the number of rows in portrait and landscape mode, add a custom header image and enable the notification panel header image or pick a header provider. Shadow effect can also be added to the header image and there’s a feature for browsing installed headers. One-handed mode and a bunch of other features Moving on, one-handed mode allows users to navigate through their phone by using just one hand. This makes it easier to browse through various apps and even reply to text messages. One-handed mode is a feature found in multiple third-party launchers or even custom ROMs, just like Pure Nexus. The changelog for the new update also brings double tap to sleep feature on navbar and the ability to hide VPN and data saver icon in the statusbar icons. Moreover, users can expose the quick settings tuner switch bar for themers, settings switch bar for themers and settings dashboard category padding for themers. Multiple icons for apps have been updated to a circle design, one of the main characteristics of Android Nougat and an element that sets this OS version aside from previous Android mobile versions. Users should keep in mind, though, that flashing custom ROMs on phones could result in loss of warranty. #Pure Nexus#Pixel#Pixel XL#Nexus#Custom ROM subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Android 7.1.1 Nougat Running Surprisingly Well on 7-Year Old Galaxy S1 Google Says Fix for Known Audio Issue Is Coming Soon to Pixel Phones Android Wear 2.0 to Supposedly Arrive on February 9 Google App to Bring New Google Assistant Features New LG G6 Leaked Picture Shows Metal Frame, Thin Bezels Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Cumulative Update KB3216755 Apple in Trouble As More Buyers Get the iPhone 6s Instead of the iPhone 7 LeakedSource Website Goes Dark Shazam Adds Three App Shortcuts for Faster Song Recognition on Android Phones LG Files Patent Applications for Foldable Smartphones Alcatel to Announce Five New Smartphones During MWC 2017 Windows 10 Mobile Start Screen vs. iOS Home Screen: Beauty and the Beast    Pure Nexus update with one-handed mode New Android APKs Brave Browser APK: Updated January 27th, 14:13 GMT Signal APK: Updated January 27th, 14:10 GMT PokeAlert - Notification for Pokemon GO APK: Updated January 27th, 14:08 GMT SmartThings Mobile APK: Updated January 27th, 14:07 GMT Newsroom APK: Updated January 27th, 14:03 GMT United Airlines APK: Updated January 27th, 14:01 GMT Reddit APK: Updated January 27th, 13:56 GMT Reader comments Sony Rolls Out Xperia X Concept Build with Battery Saver Mode more on: Sony i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

A notice released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Sunday said that all special cable and VPN services on the mainland needed to obtain prior government approval – a move making most VPN service providers illegal. The “clean-up” of the nation’s internet connections would start immediately and run until March 31, 2018, the notice said. China’s cybersecurity chiefs pledge total loyalty to leadership under Xi “China’s internet connection service market ... has signs of ­disordered development that ­require urgent regulation and governance,” the ministry said. The crackdown on unregulated internet connections aimed to “strengthen cyberspace information security management”. Major VPN service companies including Vypr and Express said they were aware of the issue. While a representative from Vypr said the company was ­“currently working on ways around this”, a representative from ­Express by the name of Dane said that his company would ­release an official statement on its blog soon. China blocks access to 135 out of 1,000 sites in one ranking of the world’s top websites, including Google, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, according to Greatfire.org, which monitors online censorship on the mainland. As a result, many internet users on the mainland rely on VPN services to access blocked sites and services. A cat-and-mouse game has thus been going on for years between the authorities and VPN service providers. The last major crackdown on VPNs was in March 2016 during the National People’s Congress meeting in Beijing. Many companies complained that their paid-for VPN services were not functioning for up to a week. China cybersecurity law likely to harm foreign firms operating on mainland, says Asia finance body chief Beijing’s censorship of online information and its control of internet access would be particularly vigilant in 2017 for the once-in-a-decade power reshuffle party congress, analysts said. The Cyberspace Administration of China, which regulates the internet and acts as an online censorship office, pledged loyalty to the Communist Party leadership headed by President Xi Jinping on January 5. Bureau officials issued a statement that said one of their priorities this year would be to cultivate an online environment that was “conducive to a successful 19th party congress”. Two days ago, two websites run by a liberal think tank, along with 15 other sites, were shut down as control tightens ahead of the party congress. The latest crackdown has caused a stir on the internet, with many social media users complaining that their VPN services had failed or slowed down. Some expressed fears of losing touch with the outside world or of being held accountable by security ­forces for using a VPN system. One Weibo user wrote: “So many people are laughing at how [US President Donald] Trump is building a wall near Mexico while we are unaware that we have been thickening our own wall. The more we monitor, the more we lose.” This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Beijing shores up great firewall   Most Popular Viewed 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Why the rich breathe easier in China’s choking smog 3 China’s central bank ‘playing dangerous game’ to prop up yuan 4 Andy Lau could be out for nine months after freak horse accident 5 On China, Trump tests ‘madman theory’ Shared 1 China tightens Great Firewall, outlawing unauthorised VPNs 2 Why the rich breathe easier in China’s choking smog 3 Workers and residents evacuated after 220kg wartime bomb found 4 On China, Trump tests ‘madman theory’ 5 Lack of popular mandate would make it hard to govern, Lam admits Commented 1 On China, Trump tests ‘madman theory’ 2 Hong Kong must understand the limits of its autonomy 3 Will Beijing take a risk on a fair leadership race in Hong Kong? 4 Why Jakarta needs to read up on 15th-century England 5 Why China’s lawyers need the world’s support Promotions Register for a free copy of Home Essentials 2017 now       You may also like Hong Kong CIA files reveal anxiety over Hong Kong’s future under Chinese rule 21 Jan 2017 - 11:18pm 43 Smart-home kits keep pet owners connected In partnership with: HKT PREMIER Opinion How Trump will try to smash Eurasian integration 22 Jan 2017 - 11:00am 4 Strategic Capital unveils ultra-luxury residential project Brought to you by JLL China How will Melania’s style compare with Michelle Obama and Peng Liyuan? 20 Jan 2017 - 9:21pm 30 Post Magazine How language dictates the menu at our Lunar New Year feasts 22 Jan 2017 - 7:32am Hong Kong Sheung Shui eco-village offers a taste of nature for city dwellers Jan 20th 2017, 7:40pm Hong Kong John Tsang makes his leadership pitch as healer of city’s ills 20 Jan 2017 - 10:30am 49 Hong Kong CY Leung uses final policy speech to refute lame duck criticism 19 Jan 2017 - 11:35am 20 Hong Kong Two dead at Macau casino complex 19 Jan 2017 - 11:54am China China ‘preparing to hit back’ against US if Trump starts trade war 19 Jan 2017 - 1:37am 26 Food & Drink Hong Kong food delivery services put to the test 20 Jan 2017 - 3:40pm 5 South China Morning Post Stay connected Facebook Twitter Hong Kong Politics Economy Health & Environment Law & Crime Education & Community News China Hong Kong Asia World China Policies & Politics Diplomacy & Defence Money & Wealth Society Economy Tech Business Companies Markets Property Investor Relations Mutual Funds Economy China Economy Money & Wealth Country Reports Tech China Tech Enterprises Social & Gadgets Start-ups Apps & Gaming Innovation Leaders & Founders Science & Research E-Commerce Lifestyle Arts & Entertainment Health & Beauty Film & TV Food & Drink Families Music Fashion & Luxury Books Travel & Leisure Watches Sport Hong Kong China Golf Racing Rugby Soccer Tennis Boxing Comment Insight & Opinion Harry's View Blogs Polls Letters Multimedia Video Photos Infographics SCMP Chronicles Magazine Post Magazine Style Good Eating Destination Macau HK Magazine Archive Other Weather Most Popular 7 Days Index Country Reports Crossword Promotions Directories Luxehomes At your service Business Services Directory MICE Biz Restaurant Directory Information Buy SCMP Photos Copyright Licensing RSS Feeds SCMP.com search Historical Archive Print Subscription Advertising Opportunities Contact our Advertising Sales HK Rate card Overseas Rate Card China Rate Card The Marketer SCMP Marketing Solutions SCMP Outdoor Advertising Recruitment Advertising Events SCMP Events Operation Santa Claus Other Sites CPJobs.com Education Post Young Post Cosmopolitan CosmoGIRL!

"We are taking responsibility," said the company's mobile President DJ Koh after a four-month-long investigation that came to a head today, during a press conference in Seoul, South Korea. The reason behind the Note 7 fires comes down to irregularly sized batteries, which caused the overheating, as well as other manufacturing problems in a second round of replacement batteries that were rushed out. Samsung sealed a sizable 3,500mAh lithium-ion battery into a 7.9mm thin smartphone, but half of the Note 7 batteries were made by its subsidiary Samsung SDI and didn’t properly fit into the Android phone. The subsequent overheating caused the first round of battery explosions and fires throughout August and September, and a handful of the incidents were caught on video or in photos. Short on time? Check out our video for the key points and whether we think Samsung has done enough to win back consumers. Samsung, nobody cares about your 8-point battery safety check Why the Note 7 battery went up in flames a second time Samsung recalled and reissued all Galaxy Note 7 phones in September, thinking that the other half of its phones – the ones with batteries made by affiliate Amperex Technology – were fine. The aftermath of an exploded Samsung Galaxy Note 7 (Photo credit: The Verge) However, the sudden ramp up in the second batch of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 phones seems to have caused a number of different manufacturing issues. At Samsung's press conference, the company said that there could have been a number of failures during this rushed process, with contributing factors including missing insulation tape and sharp edge protrusions. Image 1 of 2 Issue: The negative electrode was deflected in the upper-right corner of the battery. Image 2 of 2 Issue: High welding burrs on the positive electrode resulted in the penetration of the insulation tape and separator which then caused direct contact between the positive tab with the negative electrode. The one-two punch of production errors caused Samsung to issue another recall and ultimately cancel its popular, S-Pen toting smartphone, leaving billions of dollars on the table in the process. Samsung says that 96% of the 3 million Galaxy Note 7 phones sold have been returned worldwide, but US carrier Verizon said that ‘thousands’ of its customers are still holding onto the phone on its network. What’s next? Samsung Galaxy S8 More than money, Samsung’s reputation as the top Android phone maker has been damaged. The Note 7 is now banned on airplanes and, for several months, there was a PR-devastating flight announcement about the ban before every US plane took off.  All of this is will hurt the Samsung brand going forward, as it plans to launch new phones. The Samsung Galaxy S8 will be its new flagship handset for 2017, and it looks set to arrive in March/April this year. In short, it’s coming soon and part of Samsung’s press conference was to reassure the public that safety is (now) its top priority. It's taking "several corrective actions to ensure this never happens again," the company said today in a statement issued to TechRadar and the media. Going forward, it plans to implement multi-layer safety measures protocol at the product planning stage and an '8-Point Battery Safety Check.' But will today’s admission coupled with a (hopefully) superior Galaxy S8 be enough to keep people from switching to the iPhone 8, LG G6 or HTC 11? Only time will tell, and it will come down to whether people are happy to take Samsung's word that its batteries will indeed be safe in future devices. Samsung Galaxy S8: release date and everything you should know Don’t iPhones catch on fire too? This is the first line of defense from Samsung’s still-loyal (slightly smaller) base, and it’s what we would call mostly false for a few simple reasons. It’s true, there have been reports of iPhones exploding over the years, but they are spread out;  too few and far between. It’s not enough for a recall, but it’s enough to get everyone nervous. There’s an important lesson for all smartphone owners in almost all of these iPhone explosion horror stories: they often involve using faulty third-party chargers, meaning it’s never been determined to be an internal battery issue. Will there be a Samsung Galaxy Note 8? Samsung went on record soon after the Note 7 issues last year to say it plans to launch a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in 2017 - which may surprise some readers. It's been much quieter about a potential Note 8 launch since October 2016 though, with no further confirmation of a next generation phablet during its Note 7 press conference. Looking at the wider picture though it makes sense. The Note 7 problems were isolated to just that handset - the Galaxy S7 is fine, as was its predecessor the Galaxy Note 5.  There's no question that Samsung's phablet line has taken a serious knock, but there's still demand for a premium big-screened smartphone and the South Korean firm makes some of the best around. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 release date, news and rumors Apple, Google and LG swoop in The biggest beneficiaries of the Galaxy Note 7 recall are Apple, Google and LG, and all of them have smartphones that compete with Samsung flagship devices. iPhone 7 Plus is Apple’s phone that comes closest comparing to the Note 7 due to its 5.5-inch display. You can actually walk away with some extra cash and a free iPhone if you have a Note 7. While Samsung has offered the Galaxy S7 Edge and $100 as a replacement for its recalled phone, it has also been willing to exchange the troubled phone for an iPhone 7 Plus and still pay [former] customers $25. Ouch. Google launched the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL running its latest Android 7.0 Nougat software and compatible with the Google Daydream View VR headset. The fact that Google is taking a bigger role in hardware (and not just Android software) is just as much a threat to Samsung as Apple has been. Finally, the LG G6 is the next big Android smartphone that’s expected to be announced next month at MWC 2017 in Barcelona. It’s said to completely different from the LG G5 (that's good news for everyone) and include an extra-wide screen with an aspect ratio of 18x9. Samsung's comeback story really gets underway with the Galaxy S8 launch, but today's press conference needed to happen first to reassure phone buyers that it's safe to upgrade to the next phone.  Now it just needs to explain its Samsung washing machine explosions and we're all set.

The German automaker will put 40 of its 7 Series sedans on the road and train them to drive in urban areas, Klaus Froehlich, BMW’s head of development, said in an interview. The goal is to apply the gathered data toward producing the iNext, which will supplant the 7 Series as the BMW brand’s flagship model and be capable of full autonomy four years from now. Automakers and technology companies are rushing to form partnerships to compete against the likes of Alphabet Inc.’s Google, which has clocked 2 million self-driving miles on public roads, and Tesla Motors Inc., with 1.3 billion miles of data from Autopilot-equipped vehicles. BMW is appealing to other carmakers to adopt its approach to help shoulder research costs, speed development by sharing data and ensure they don’t become also-rans. “Those who reach the finish line before you will have their tech become the basis of standardization,” Amnon Shashua, Mobileye’s co-founder and chief technology officer, said in an interview. “This is why sharing is important.” BMW will be following Uber Technologies Inc. and Volvo Cars in putting autonomous cars on the road, with the latter two companies partnering on test vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Other carmakers have been reluctant so far to heed BMW’s call for adopting its platform. Rival Daimler AG has said it prefers to develop its own technology. Mobileye shares rose as much as 4.4 percent to the highest intraday in three months and traded at $42.12 as of 1:12 p.m. in New York. Costly Technology Enabling vehicles to navigate without human input through cities requires them to see and understand complex situations more like people do. Jerusalem-based Mobileye brings expertise in cameras that model the surroundings while Santa Clara, California-based Intel wields computing capabilities to power artificial intelligence. The companies released details Wednesday in conjunction with CES 2017, the consumer-technology show in Las Vegas. “If everybody would use the same network, it will be best,” Froehlich said. “At the beginning, I think only premium cars will be able to afford such technology.” Carmakers could participate by buying sensors to install in their cars, or go deeper with equipment that helps crowd-source data from an autonomous-vehicle fleet, said Kathy Winter, vice president and general manager of Intel’s Automated Driving Division. While Munich-based BMW’s main target is individual car owners, the technology will be available for ride-sharing fleets as well, Froehlich said. Auto manufacturers are pushing into so-called mobility services like car-sharing and ride-hailing to counter alternatives to private vehicle ownership. Partnerships Form BMW, which co-owns the DriveNow car-sharing venture with Sixt SE, will be jockeying for consumers’ attention against the likes of Uber, Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG, among others. Google, which separated its self-driving car project into a new unit called Waymo last month, plans to start a ride-sharing service using semi-autonomous minivans made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV as soon as the end of 2017. VW is rolling out Moia, a new division that will focus on ride-sharing. Revenue from car-sharing is projected to surge more than sevenfold to 4.7 billion euros ($4.9 billion) by 2021, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group Inc. Robo-taxis will make up 40 percent of automotive profits by 2030, more than selling vehicles to individuals, according to consulting company Roland Berger.

Women's March in St. Paul. Jan. 21, 2017. Emmily Bergstedt March leads to wacky press conference, which leads to phrase "alternative facts" Not just in the U.S., but across the globe, people gathered in hundreds of cities Saturday to protest the election of Donald Trump and his administration's policies as part of the Women's March.  Reports of around 5 million people protested in every state in the U.S. and beyond, including Antarctica and multiple cities in the Eastern Hemisphere. Estimates in Washington, D.C., were around 500,000.  In Madison, police estimated between 75,000-100,000 people protested, while numbers in St. Paul hovered between 90,000-100,000. Two overlying themes, aside from the obvious mass protest to Trump's inauguration, were that no arrests were made - in Washington, Madison or St. Paul - during the peaceful protests, which was not the case Saturday in D.C., and that estimated numbers in nearly every city swelled beyond expectations. It doesn't end there, however. The Women's March website has begun a plan of action for the next 100 days with the first step being writing Senators. The Madison rally numbers rivaled that of protests against Gov. Scott Walker's Act 10 anti-union legislation in 2011.  In Chicago, estimates came in around 250,000 and the march had to be cancelled because of the huge crowds. Protesters gathered in Grant Park and the surrounding areas. The estimates in New York range between 200,000-500,000, as some headed up Fifth Ave. toward Trump Tower. Los Angeles came in between 200,000-750,000, while another 250,000 rallied in Boston. UConn professor Jeremy Pressman has a running tally of crowd estimates in the U.S. in this Google doc, which brings U.S. totals between 3.3 million and 4.6 million protesters. Beyond the borders, in the UK, between 80,000-100,000 joined the Women's March on London, raising banners, flags and their voices against Trump. And, another 14 marches took place in towns and cities including Manchester, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Leeds and Belfast the Guardian reported. Women March Around the World Hundreds of thousands of women gathered in Washington in a kind of counterinauguration after President Donald J. Trump took office. They were joined by hundreds of thousands around the nation and the world. Read more: http://nyti.ms/2iWZe4v Posted by The New York Times on Saturday, January 21, 2017 Even in Antarctica they protested. Around 30 eco-minded tourists and non-government scientists aboard a ship in international waters hoisted signs saying "Penguins for peace" and "Seals for science," organizers said. Yes, even people from Antarctica are joining the #WomensMarch movement https://t.co/hpoyM1daIO pic.twitter.com/HvYtHifz0m — CNN (@CNN) January 21, 2017 Saturday, instead of acknowledging the protests, Donald Trump, at CIA headquarters, said the "dishonest media" underestimated the numbers of his inauguration. “It looked honestly – it looked like a million and a half people," said Trump, who wouldn't have been able to see the grounds on a foggy afternoon. "Whatever it was, it was. But it went all the way back to the Washington Monument. And I turn on the thing, and by mistake I get this network, and it showed an empty field. And it said we drew 250,000 people. Now that’s not bad, but it’s a lie." The 250,000 estimate could have come from, literally, the amount of tickets printed, according to Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies website, or it may have come from Dan Gross, who helped coordinate at Barack Obama's 2012 inauguration. #Inauguration crowd size?  The difference in pictures. pic.twitter.com/SulfzccOyc — Dan Gross (@DanJGross) January 20, 2017 Analyst Keith Still, a professor at Manchester Metropolitan University in England, estimated Trump's crowd on the National Mall on Friday to be about one-third the size of Obama’s 2009 inauguration, according to the New York Times. Whatever the number, pictures show a different story, though Trump said of the media reports, "So, we caught them. And we caught them in a beauty and I think they're going to pay a big price.” Trump made the National Parks Service pay a price for retweeting a comparison picture between Obama and Trump inauguration crowds on the National Mall - which the parks services manages. Trump's administration ordered the parks service to stop using its Twitter account and deleted the retweet. This was the retweet from a NYT correspondent that was deleted. Compare the crowds: 2009 inauguration at left, 2017 inauguration at right.#Inauguration pic.twitter.com/y7RhIR2nfC — Binyamin Appelbaum (@BCAppelbaum) January 20, 2017 The parks service has since apologized to Trump for the "mistake" of retweeting two comparison pictures on the site of its own park.  We regret the mistaken RTs from our account yesterday and look forward to continuing to share the beauty and history of our parks with you pic.twitter.com/mctNNvlrmv — NationalParkService (@NatlParkService) January 21, 2017 Since the inauguration, Trump's White House Press Sec. Sean Spicer and senior aide Kellyanne Conway have been on the offensive. Late Saturday, Spicer called the new White House's first-ever press conference to complain about inauguration coverage, saying the reports "to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong."  Spicer didn't take questions and gave excuses as to why the inauguration numbers were either low or were reported as such. His reasons, however, were immediately criticized as either completely false or vague/misleading, as both CNN, the Washington Post and others reported. Following up Spicer's presser, on Sunday Conway was on Meet the Press defending the press secretary, saying he was giving "alternative facts," which may be an early candidate for word/phrase of 2017 (2016's word of the year from Oxford Dictionaries was post-truth). Host Chuck Todd immediately questioned Conway's remark, saying "Alternative facts? Four of the five facts (Spicer) uttered, the one thing he got right ... Four of the five facts he uttered were just not true. Look, alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods." "Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods," Chuck Todd tells Pres. Trump's counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. WATCH: pic.twitter.com/Ao005dQ13r — Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017 Trump didn't acknowledge the 2-million-plus people protesting his election Saturday around the globe, but he did take to Twitter on Sunday. Around 7 a.m. he wrote, "Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly." Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election! Why didn't these people vote? Celebs hurt cause badly. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017 And hour and a half later - after a Tweet about how more people watched his inauguration than four years ago - Trump added, "Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy. Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views."

With offices, malls and other commercial establishments preferring to outsource cleaning jobs, the cleaning sector is going through a positive growth trajectory. “It’s a tough job to recruit labour and ensure that they do cleaning perfectly. Therefore, offices and commercial establishments prefer to outsource it to some other agency if possible, rather than doing it themselves. Outsourcing the cleaning job will not only relieve establishments of an unnecessary headache, but will also be very cost-effective. This trend is creating a market for the cleaning industry,” said Murthy A L N, business development manager at McLean. McLean counts Google, TCS, Novotel Hotels, ITC Hotels, Dr Reddy’s and others among its client list. The market for the cleaning sector comes from both offices and commercial spaces across sectors such as IT/IT-enabled services, hospitality, healthcare, industries and even from the government sector. Of late, even government offices have been outsourcing cleaning jobs. Given the growing preference by businesses for outsourcing of cleaning and house-keeping jobs, the sector has been growing at a fast clip and the industry size is pegged at Rs 2,000 crore per annum in India. “The advantage from cleaning industry is that it has huge scope to create jobs, especially for unskilled. Right now, about 10 million are employed in this sector and with the sector set to grow further, more jobs will be created. There is also huge scope for small entrepreneurs and start-ups in this sector, because a cleaning services business can be started with as less as five workers,” explains industry expert Managala Chandran. With the market expanding, even the sector is getting more organised. Besides employing people, it is also looking towards the use of more machines and tech upgradation. But unlike in the service segment, the Indian cleaning sector is yet to make strides in the manufacturing sector. “Over the past three to four years, the sector has registered more than 20 percent growth. In case of cleaning equipment manufacturing, 10-15 percent growth is being witnessed. We have to invest in research and development to come up with machines suited for Indian conditions and it needs investment. Not much thrust is seen in manufacturing of cleaning equipment as of now, though it might grow as the sector grows in size,” says Shashank Sinha, marketing head of Eureka Forbes. Eureka Forbes and Roots Multi Clean are among the few Indian companies that manufacture cleaning equipment indigenously, while most of the companies import machines from China and sell them here after re-branding. Though Nilfisk, Karcher and other international companies have a presence in the Indian cleaning equipments sector, industry insiders say that even these foreign companies are not focusing much on India, thus presenting a scope for indigenous manufacturing in the sector. Puneet Mishra, director of Comac India, points out that as the cleaning sector is expected to grow, in the future even the cleaning equipment and machines manufacturing segment might see growth. While a long-time strategy is needed for giving a fillip to equipment manufacturing, training unskilled workers is the immediate problem to be addressed by the industry, as there are no training institutes or organisations right now for skilling in the sector. “As there are no skill development programmes as of now, organisations are recruiting and training the employees themselves. Even we are planning to design and conduct skill development programmes, as the sector can create jobs,” said Vaishali Sinha, founder and general secretary of I-Professional Housekeepers Association.

Finance Search Cuba sees explosion in internet accessAAP – Mon, Jan 23, 2017 1:10 PM AEDT Two days before Christmas, Luis Gonzalez received a little Chinese modem from Cuba's state-owned telecommunications company. The 55-year-old theatre producer connected the device to his phone and his laptop computer, which instantly lit up with a service unimaginable in the Cuba of just a few years ago - relatively fast home internet. "It's really easy to sit and find whatever you need," Gonzalez said as he updated his Facebook account, listening to Uruguayan radio online. "Most Cubans aren't used to this convenience." Home internet came to Cuba in December in a limited pilot program that's part of the most dramatic change in daily life here since the declaration of detente with the United States on December 17, 2014. While Cuba remains one of the world's least internet-connected societies, ordinary citizens' access to the internet has exploded over the past two years. Since the summer of 2015, the Cuban government has opened 240 public Wi-Fi spots in parks and on street corners across the country. Cubans were previously restricted to decrepit state internet clubs and hotels that charged $US6-$US8 for an hour of slow internet. In a country with an average monthly salary of around $US25, the price of an hour online has dropped to $US1.50 - still steep but now well within the range of many Cubans with private income or financial help from relatives abroad. The government estimates that 100,000 Cubans connect to the internet daily. A new feature of urban life in Cuba is the sight of people sitting at all hours on street corners or park benches, their faces illuminated by the screen of smartphones connected by applications such as Facebook Messenger to relatives in Miami, Ecuador or other outposts of the Cuban diaspora. Connections are made mostly through access cards sold by the state monopoly and often resold on street corners for higher prices. The spread of connectivity has remotely reunited families separated for years, even decades. It's fuelled the spread of Airbnb and other booking services that have funnelled millions in business to private bed-and-breakfasts owners. And it's exposed Cubans to a faster flow of news and cultural developments from the outside world - supplementing the availability of media spread on memory drivers. Cuban ingenuity has spread internet far beyond those public places: thousands of people grab the public signals through commercially available repeaters, imported illegally into Cuba and often sold for about $US100 - double the original price. Mounted on rooftops, the repeaters grab the public signals and create a form of home internet increasingly available in private rentals for tourists and cafes and restaurants for both Cubans and visitors. On the official front, Google and Cuba's state-run telecoms monopoly Etecsa struck a deal in December to store Google content like YouTube video on servers inside Cuba, giving people on the island faster, smoother access. While the explosion of internet in Cuba has occurred alongside the process of normalisation started by Obama in 2014, it's unclear how much better relations have speeded up Cuba's move online. In announcing detente, Obama said he welcomed "Cuba's decision to provide more access to the internet for its citizens," but neither Obama's team nor Cuban officials have detailed whether that decision was directly linked to negotiations to restore diplomatic ties and began negotiations. What is clear is that Cuba began to dramatically increase access about six months later when the government began opening Wi-Fi spots around the country. For many Cubans, the start of home internet in December is potentially even more significant, breaking a longstanding barrier against private internet access in a country whose communist government remains deeply wary about information technology undermining its near-total control of media, political life and most of the economy. The pace of change in Cuba often depends on the state of relations with its giant neighbour to the north: both tensions with the US and leaps forward like Obama's visit to Havana in 2016 have prompted crackdowns by hardliners worried about the government losing control. While US President Donald Trump has promised to take a harder line on Cuba, both opponents of President Raul Castro's government and those advocating closer relations favour more access to information for ordinary Cubans. The home internet test program selected some 2,000 residents of Old Havana to receive free connections for two months before a planned expansion and the start of billing for the service. Gonzalez said he would be able to receive 30 hours of his 128 kilobyte-per-second connection for $US15, with the price increasing for faster connections, with 30 hours of a 2 megabyte-per-second connection available for $US115. That's far slower and wildly more expensive than internet in most of the rest of the world. Cuba depended on slow, expensive satellite internet until 2013, when it opened a fibre-optic cable to Venezuela that connected the island to the global online infrastructure. Cuba says that its still-high internet prices are a result of costs imposed by the US trade embargo on the island. Independent observers blame the costs on political decisions to limit access, and on the cash-strapped socialist government's widespread use of its monopoly power to extract as much money as possible for goods and services considered luxuries. Many young people hope that the spread of access in recent years is the start of Cuba seeing internet more as a necessity and a right, like the free education and health care guaranteed by Cuba's socialist system.

The upcoming wearable has been rumored for a long time and it first surfaced online back in October. Like with the previous leak from last year, the photos of the HTC Halfbreak show a very similar smartwatch. The device comes with a circular display with two physical buttons on the right side and a rubber watch strap. HTC's smartwatch shown running older version of Android Wear. Photo: Weibo Related Stories HTC Is Cutting Back On Smartphone Releases In 2017 HTC U Play Is U Ultra's Mid-Range Brother On the back, HTC’s logo is accompanied by Urban Armour’s logo. The photo of the back also gives everyone a clear look at the heart rate sensor, as well as a set of four metallic pins which are presumably for charging the device. The HTC Halfbreak shown in the photos also appears to be running an older version of Android Wear and Google Play services from 2015, as pointed out by Android Authority. Android Wear 2.0 is rumored to launch next month on Feb. 9, which is why it’s a bit odd that this device isn’t running a pre-release version of that software. HTC and Under Armour's logos on the back of the new Halfbreak smartwatch. Photo: Weibo The HTC smartwatch has been rumored ever since Google first announced Android Wear back in 2014. HTC never released an Android Wear smartwatch in 2015 and 2016, and it was also reported that the device may have already been shelved, according to Android Headlines. It’s being speculated that the HTC Halfbreak smartwatch might be officially unveiled during this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain which kicks of on Feb. 27. With Android Wear 2.0 already being out for a couple of weeks by then, the timing makes a lot of sense. Looking at the big picture however, HTC’s plan to release a smartwatch this year could be a bad idea. Smartwatch sales have struggled in the past year, and the company faces heavy competition with the likes of Apple, Samsung, LG and Fitbit.

By editor • Jan 22, 2017 Related Program:  All Things Considered TweetShareGoogle+Email Listen Listening... / Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: Earlier in the program, we talked about the media and it's often fraught relationship with the Trump administration set off most recently by a confrontation about the size of the inaugural crowds. Now, Donald Trump has been accusing the media of distributing what he calls fake news for some time. In those instances, President Trump seems often to be referring to information that is accurate, but that he finds upsetting. But The New York Times just published a piece about something that journalists, as well as others, find even more worrisome - the spreading of completely false information under the guise of news. New York Times reporter Scott Shane managed to track down a practitioner of this and convinced the man, Cameron Harris, to describe how and why he did it for a recent piece titled "From Headline To Photograph: A Fake News Masterpiece." SCOTT SHANE: Cameron Harris is a 23-year-old recent graduate of Davidson College in North Carolina. He majored in politics and economics, and by his account - he's Republican, very active in politics, wants to be a political consultant. But he claims quite credibly that he did this really more for the money than for the politics. MARTIN: Cameron Harris created several false stories for a defunct news domain christiantimesnewspaper.com which he'd picked up for $5. Many of the false stories were debunked almost immediately by the respected fact-checking website snopes.com. But one story of Harris' has stood out to Scott Shane. It read "Breaking: Tens Of Thousands Of Fraudulent Clinton Votes Found In Ohio Warehouse." I asked Scott Shane why Cameron Harris decided to write this particular story and why it had such a big impact. SHANE: There was a point when Trump began to say that he feared the election would be rigged, and then he started repeatedly saying in every speech he gave, you know, they're rigging the election, the election's rigged. And so there was this feeling that on the part of his supporters that somehow something was going wrong and that Hillary Clinton was doing something, you know, illicit to rig the election. And so Cameron Harris decided he would try to tap into that by essentially providing the proof that this election was rigged. So he said he started with a headline, you know, "Tens Of Thousands Of Fraudulent Clinton Ballots Found In Ohio Warehouse" - made up out of whole cloth. And he invented a guy, an electrician, who had wandered into a backroom at a warehouse and stumbled upon these boxes of ballots that were pre-marked for Clinton. He decided a picture would be good. And he went - and he did what any one of us does when we want to find a picture of something. He did a Google image search, and he found a picture in the Birmingham News in the U.K. And it was from an election, but an election, of course, completely unrelated to the presidential election in the U.S. But it showed a gentleman standing behind a big stack of ballot boxes, so he just took that picture from the Birmingham News and said that that was a picture of this man who discovered the fraudulent Clinton ballots in Ohio. MARTIN: You say that even though Cameron Harris who made all this up is a Republican and is inclined to support Republicans, that his real motivation was money. He just wanted to make the money from the clicks. So do you have any sense of how much money he made from this fake story? SHANE: I do. He actually shared with me his statement from Google that essentially gave the revenue for the life of the site, and it totaled $22,000, which is not a huge amount of money. But Cameron Harris estimated that he put a total of 20 hours into this project. So for the time that he put into it, it was, you know, more than a thousand dollars an hour. That particular story - his greatest hit so to speak, the one about the fake Clinton ballots - that one he estimated made about $5,000 by itself. He said it took him about 15 minutes to write the story. MARTIN: When you confronted him, how did he feel about what he had done? Did he express any remorse? SHANE: You know, to defend himself, he started kind of doing what, in fact, Donald Trump has done recently which is accuse the mainstream media of fake news. There's a difference between, you know, taking unverified information and trying to prove it or disprove it. And that's very different, in my mind, from sitting down to make something up out of whole cloth that you know from the beginning is false. He didn't fully seem to accept or grasp that distinction. MARTIN: So was there any reaction to your story? SHANE: Yes. Actually the Maryland delegate, the member of Maryland legislature that Cameron Harris worked for as a sort of legislative aide read the story and fired him immediately, saying he, you know, would not tolerate dishonesty. And the other thing that happened is that Cameron Harris' alma mater Davidson College in North Carolina, which prides itself on its honor code, actually put out a statement expressing, you know, essentially regret that one of its alums had gotten involved in something like this. And then the president of the college sent a letter to all alumni, again, sort of expressing regret about this and saying they would use this fake news case study involving one of their graduates as a lesson for future students to teach them about, you know, the honor code and the difference between right and wrong. MARTIN: That was reporter Scott Shane from The New York Times. Thanks so much for joining us. SHANE: Very glad to be with you. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.

If there is one thing we will always be able to count on, it is that the internet will continue to be the internet. The internet will continue to be the weird, awkward, hilarious, and bizarre place where just when you think you’ve seen everything – someone posts about something that shocks, amazes, and maybe even disgusts you. Still don’t believe me? Well, Bustle created a list of hilarious 2017 Inauguration Day tweets and memes that will help you laugh through the pain. And this list? Well, it is just one of many lists with all the hilarious social media posts and pictures floating around the internet about Inauguration Day. Donald Trump [Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images]] Whether you are or are not supportive of Donald Trump being president of the United States, I think we can all agree the mood is filled with a lot of hate, anger, and sadness right now. There really isn’t as much happiness and laughter as there should be. Fortunately, funny 2017 Inauguration Day tweets can help change that. After all, if it wasn’t for the internet and social media, phrases like “Bernie Sander’s steel chair” wouldn’t be trending on Google right now, but I’ll get to that a little later. For now, sit back and enjoy some 2017 Inauguration Day tweets intended to lighten the mood. Just consider putting down the beverage for this one. No one wants to shoot their beverage from their nose while laughing. Inauguration Day Weather Report The https://t.co/240qFK2wmo forecast for inauguration day in DC is warm showers.

I can't decide if this crowd seems too small for a presidential inauguration or too big for a 3 Doors Down concert. — Vincent Casimir (@vncnt_csmr) January 20, 2017 People were joking about the size of the Inauguration Day crowd long before the media and Trump’s association started arguing about it.

Even then, there were a lot of people on social media hoping Bernie would appear and knock Trump out with his steel chair.

Some were questioning why he didn’t just wear a waterproof jacket. Some even thought it looked a little like he was just trapped in the plastic and trying to get out of it. What do you think?

Moon Express, a Florida—based firm, said it had raised $20m in financing, which will allow it to send a robotic spacecraft to the moon’s surface later this year. The funding is a major step in its efforts to become world’s first private enterprise to travel outside the Earth’s orbit. Last year, Moon Express gained historic approvals from the US government after submitting a request for its voyage to the Federal Aviation Administration. An outer space treaty, which was adopted by the UN and regulates exploration of the celestial world, requires governments to authorize and supervise “non—governmental entities” seeking to travel in outer space. Moon Express is one of 16 teams that have competed for funding as part of Google’s Lunar X Prize initiative, which launched in 2007 to incentivize private firms to develop technology and plans for planetary exploration. Moon Express, which said it has raised a total of more than $45m from individuals and venture funds, is one of numerous companies that has specific plans in the works for exploration. A firm called Deep Space Industries is seeking to launch an autonomous spacecraft this year that can extract materials from asteroids. Planetary Resources, a company supported by Google’s Larry Page and Eric Schmidt, is also building technology dedicated to asteroid mining with the goal of 2020 commercial mission. Last year, the US government advanced the process to establish rules for space launches in compliance with international treaties after Luxembourg and the United Arab Emirates pushed forward with similar efforts. Motley Fool, a financial services site, has estimated that the mineral wealth of the moon may be quadrillions of dollars.Guardian News & Media Ltd, 2017 The US, China, India and Japan and former Soviet Union are the only countries that have landed spacecraft on the moon.

Jaideep Mehta 2017 will see the gradual influx of 3D printers into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. Photo: iStock Imagine this: you are travelling for work to London and staying in an apartment rented through Airbnb. As you hail the Uber cab for your business meeting, your phone beeps an urgent message and you swipe your finger on the fingerprint scanner to read the notification. You learn that a critical machine on your shop floor is overheating, and the message tells you that based upon previous experience, it is likely to break down soon. As a precautionary measure, the system has automatically sent a request to the in-house 3D printer to produce the component likely to be impacted. You pull out your Oculus from the briefcase, connect it to the app on the phone and get a visual of the machine and the impacted component. At the click of a button, the system also gives you three scenarios of the impact on the production if the machine goes down. You make the necessary phone calls using the low-cost WhatsApp and speak to the factory manager. Comforted by his response, your mind is clear for your upcoming meeting. What you have just done is leveraging mobile, next-generation security, Internet of Things (IoT), cognitive computing, natural interfaces and analytics technologies to perform a simple but critical management intervention which ensured the smooth running of your business. Welcome to your new world, Ms CEO. A tsunami of new technologies has hit the business ecosystem. The first ripples were felt in the middle of the last decade and were evidenced by the likes of Salesforce.com and that upstart called Amazon Web Services, Inc. What a curious idea it was for an e-commerce company to expose, and rent out, its underlying infrastructure to third parties! IDC predicts a third of all industry leaders will be replaced by 2020. That’s how profound the disruption is. Click here for enlarge On the consumer side, the waves intensified towards the end of the decade as social media took centre stage and e-commerce boomed in every single major economy in the world. As I write this, Facebook has nearly 1.8 billion users and Alibaba has sold $18 billion worth of products in a single day. Consumer services companies, vividly exemplifying the sharing economy, have become household brands: today, more millennials possibly identify with Uber and Airbnb than they do with venerable corporations such as Johnson & Johnson, and GE. The force of the sharing economy is reshaping vast tracts of the consumer ecosystem, effecting the closure of retail giants such as Circuit City and Woolworths, and acquisitions such as that of Starwood Hotels by Marriott. The waves are swamping those without the lifeboat of digital capabilities. The first intense wave of change came with technologies which created what IDC calls the third platform of computing. The four pillars of the third platform, namely social, mobile, analytics and cloud (SMAC), today aggregate to a market exceeding $0.5 trillion. According to IDC research, it’s still expected to grow in excess of 13% in 2016, taking more than 35% of overall technology spending. It accounts for 110% of the industry’s growth: traditional IT spending, while still two thirds of overall spend, is shrinking at greater than 5% a year. The third platform of computing is a profound shift in the computing paradigm. Users have moved from millions to billions, devices from tens to hundreds of millions and there’s enough data generated on Planet Earth to fill up the memory of a stack of Apple iPads all the way to the moon— and back. SMAC technologies have transformed IT fundamentally, and opened up entirely new opportunities for businesses. From smart products to analytics businesses and from real-time system enabled mobile field forces to digital supply chains, businesses across the spectrum have embraced these in different ways to drive economic value. The maturing of the third platform of computing has enabled entirely new technologies, and combinations, to develop and mature. IDC collectively calls them the innovation accelerators, as our research identifies their potential to drive not just technology and process but also complete business disruption. Of these technologies, the following five are likely to take centre stage in India in 2017. Watch out for them. Next gen security If you’re like me and have a continuous wrestling match with your store of forgotten “capital letter-alphanumeric—change-them-every-two-weeks” passwords, then I can give you some comfort. The era of the complicated password will soon pass. Next generation security systems are integrating biometrics (fingerprint, voice, iris recognition) with behavioural analytics (usage location, onsite/on-app behaviour, transaction patterns) to help make bank accounts, health records, government databases and countless other stores of sensitive information ever more secure. Though not visible to most, the security of the networks our data whizzes around on, and of the data centres which power up the modern economy, is also undergoing radical modernization. For example, network security is not just about appliances detecting ‘bad actors’ anymore: it’s moving to a managed services model where the network is monitored for bad actors, real-time responses become a reality and damage control processes kick in instantly in the event of a hack. From Apple’s fingerprint readers to behavioural security platforms being introduced by the likes of Intel Security and Cisco, the industry is racing to help us realize the possibilities these technologies unlock. Expect a new paradigm in security to make life easier, and more secure, for you in 2017 and beyond. Cognitive systems The notion of intelligent machines has fascinated man for decades. It has been the subject of Hollywood movies, science fiction books and doomsday theories. Well, they’ve arrived but not in the way you thought. I must stress that intelligent machines of the current generation do not have native intelligence as humans do. They are getting ‘smarter’ on the back of their ability to process vast quantities of data really fast, and identify patterns and trends to be used. Who knows what the next generation of machines brings, though? A common example is the “May I help you?” assistants, which have appeared on e-commerce websites. Increasingly, you are not interacting with a human but a piece of software if you do ask a question. It has been programmed with learning algorithms, and fed masses of product catalogue and user behaviour data to be able to help you. Intelligent machines are also parsing through all the published legal cases and court decisions in recorded history to help lawyers serve their clients better; and doing exactly the same with doctors trying to figure out what might be wrong with a sick patient. IBM’s Watson platform is perhaps the best known in this space, but it’s not the only one. Google has a different approach with the TensorFlow and Google Cloud Machine Learning combination. The analytics platforms from the likes of SAS are evolving too, as are new-age data storage systems from NetApp, HP Enterprise and their peers. The year 2017 will see consumer services firms in different sectors adopting cognitive technologies more aggressively. Expect the likes of banks, e-commerce companies, telecom service providers and hospitals to deploy them faster than others. From a wider perspective, the full story will unfold in 2018-19. Internet of Things (IoT) The Internet today has enabled interactions and engagement in society in ways which were not imagined even a decade ago. Video calling through the phone at practically zero marginal cost, cloud computing which allows organizations to think at global scale without the need for massive technology investments and a plethora of consumer services at your doorstep are just three manifestations of the amazing power of the Internet. The next wave is now upon us: machines are now interacting with each other and triggering processes without human intervention. In the process, mountains of data are being generated daily, enabling machine learning and cognitive computing. This is IoT. The 2016 IDC IoT survey in India, which covered 470 companies, reveals a great enthusiasm for IoT already. Process manufacturing companies as well as logistics services and trucking firms are leading the way. The Industrial Internet is born. The year 2017 is likely to see the inflection point of IoT adoption in India. Billions of sensors will help monitor oil pipelines remotely, control home air-conditioning systems and track trucks and pallets as they move through our vast countryside. Its potential is staggering, its promise mouth-watering. It can generate crores of rupees worth of efficiencies and productivity gains in the corporate sector; for consumers, it could mean being able to switch on your air conditioner before you reach home; or your coffee machine grinding the beans when the sensors in your bedroom note that you’ve up. 3D printing At a recent conference, Anand Mahindra, chairman of the Mahindra Group, shared that they had put a 3D printer in a school as part of corporate social responsibility and R&D initiatives. The group was keen to see what innovation the children might come up with if they are given the right tools. The results are awaited but early signs are promising. The term 3D printing, in some ways, is a misnomer. They are actually capital goods equipment which operate visually like printers do. In the future, this technology is likely to radically remake manufacturing. Supply chains will be disrupted and the manufacturing process for many products will be democratized, with the possibility of garage-based production and retail store production already being realized. Nike’s Fly Knit shoes are made in-shop after your foot is scanned and the images sent to the 3D printer. Skin grafts have been synthesized in labs; auto parts are being 3D printed. In 2017, we will see the gradual influx of these machines into manufacturing firms, research labs and the possible odd hospital. It will take some time and price cuts before 3D printers go mainstream. But it holds much promise and would be especially useful for far-flung areas of the nation. Natural user interfaces What I wouldn’t give to not have to get up for the remote control, and simply change the channel on the television with a swipe of my hand, or through a conveniently placed gadget that would recognize my voice and change the channel! That’s Natural User Interface (NUI) for you and it’s here to stay. But really, while that TV remote is still important, a lot of what we experience is now being redefined by new forms of cognitive controls. The shift from text to graphics was a major leap, courtesy of Xerox Corpo ration, and popularised by Apple with their hallmark Macintosh OS in 1984. More recently, we’ve witnessed a revolution of sorts in the UI space: touch (smartphones), voice (Siri) and even gesture (Microsoft Kinect, Nintendo Wii). Today consumers want amplified, immersive and authentic experiences from what they consume; NUI enables just that. The human-machine interface is fast changing our experiences, thus heralding an era of multi-touch surfaces, powerful and lightweight mobile devices and now the emerging market of wearable technology. We are entering a fascinating world sans constraints physical and virtual. On the enterprise side, firms today are increasing the connect with their ecosystem of customers, employees, suppliers and partners, moving away from mere CX (customer experience) to authentic experiences. At IDC, we’re seeing this extensively in media and gaming; it is a matter of time before NUI permeates retail, healthcare, fashion and automobile verticals. It is my considered view that when the neural capabilities of touch, voice and gesture and the capable hardware that’s available to process these inputs (at consumer prices to boot) are coupled with the large scale APIs to leverage these NUI opportunities, a new age of platforms which can redesign and revolutionize your experience will dawn. 2017 shall be a year when the increasing clamour for experience by consumers and the omni-experience transformation needs of enterprises shall see a scaling up of investments towards this aim. As this technology transformation evolves, so too will its impact on consumer experience and the digital business ecosystem. In sum, 2017 will see the next technological revolution reshaping Indian society, business and the government landscape. Recent events have already triggered the digitalization of the payments ecosystem at warp speed. The five technologies described above, individually and in combination, will herald the dawn of the next technological age. Jaideep Mehta is managing director, IDC India and South Asia. Five trends that can change the tech world by 2021 Internet-of-things (IoT) software and solutions: IoT will be driving new levels of customer insight and engagement for some by 2021, but technology diversity and the need for organizational changes will still stymie or delay many firms. Intelligent agents: Intelligent agents and related robots will have eliminated a net 6% of jobs by 2021. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR): By 2021, AR will be commonplace, while VR will remain niche. Artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technology: Solutions powered by AI/cognitive technology will displace jobs with the biggest impact felt in transportation, logistics, customer service, and consumer services. Hybrid wireless: 5G will be rolling out by 2021, creating a high-bandwidth cellular backbone to support IoT devices. In addition, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi will expand their capabilities to support IoT devices.

Phuket Business Business Buzz: Social media trends to look out for this year Phuket Gazette - January 23, 2017 | 07:00 AM            As people's social media attention spans get shorter, the critical advantage for businesses will be building real relationships with their clients and partners. Photo: Amanda Paul PHUKET: As we begin another new year, it is a timely opportunity to consider what we should look out for in 2017. It is always important to reevaluate your digital footprint on a regular basis. Here are my 2017 tips to have a successful year in social media and beat your competition, increase your revenues and improve customer loyalty. Remember, an efficient sales funnel is critical, especially combined with a good product and a customer-friendly approach. Use these techniques to build your database, and consider splitting that between a local and tourist market if relevant. Stand Out From the Crowd Dare to be different. A lot of social media is people being sheep, following what others do without any real thought or application. Avoid this trap  find your voice, but don’t be afraid to do something different or untried. At the end of the day, the goal is to be seen and remembered. This will put money in the bank account  but just be careful about being too risque. Relationships Will Be Key There is no doubt that as people’s social media attention spans get shorter and shorter with more voluminous online marketing coming their way, the critical factor will be building real relationships. There is a fine line between selling and marketing  people love to buy but hate to be sold to, so build the relationship better than the rest and your sale will happen. Use Systems and Automation There are so many fantastic digital products out there at the moment that you would be crazy not to be using them. Often they are free or very cheap, and the benefits are golden. Why do the hard work when an app can do it all for you. Facebook Live, Instagram Videos and pictures will be used more in 2017. Imagine showing off your hotel rooms or new housing display live on Facebook with a limited time offer of availability, a dining experience at your restaurant, a live band at your bar the list goes on. This will create engagement, interaction and a following. Google Places Google and its takeover of everything internet means that if you are not plugged in you are missing out. Google Maps is now on almost every smart phone, and for zero cost your business could be showcased to your local clients. Make sure you get listed today. Create A Connected Digital Footprint Make sure that you have a cohesive, integrated online footprint. Decide what presence you want, then have them interconnect and work with each other. In my next column I am going to suggest what I would do if I had to start from scratch knowing what I know, but for the time being, think website, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter.

According to Advertising Age, research firm Advertiser Perceptions polled 399 executives from some of the top-spending marketers and agencies, and uncovered widespread scepticism about the social media network's claims. Half of these advertisers said they would not spend money on platforms they consider to be risky, while two-thirds reported that they are now questioning their investment with Facebook. It seems that Facebook's acknowledgement of repeated errors and miscalculations at the end of last year has dented confidence in social media advertising as a whole, which now stands at below 50%, according to the survey findings. And that decreasing confidence is translating into marketers' decisions about budget allocations in 2017, with just 8% of respondents saying they plan to spend more on Facebook than Google compared with 36% who intend to spend more on Google rather than Facebook. "Facebook can't go whistling in the dark now," said Kevin Mannion, Chief Strategy Officer at Advertiser Perceptions. "While they've built up too much goodwill and success for the metrics restatements to automatically erode spending, they need to take the lead in third-party verification," he continued. "Digital advertising platforms can’t assume that trust issues will blow over. No matter what is being said in meetings or from conference stages, the biggest ad buyers are clearly apprehensive." However, while the survey pointed to concerns about Facebook and greater confidence in Google-dominated search advertising, the industry is unlikely to see a major transfer of budgets away from digital advertising, according to Rob Silver, SVP of Media at digital agency SapientRazorfish. "We are not seeing any of our clients pull away from digital platforms and shifting to TV or more traditional channels," he said. "The audiences and targeting enabled through digital are simply too important."

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 22, 2017 7:25pm   Comments Share: This weekend's Barron's cover story is the second part of the 2017 Barron's Roundtable coverage. Other featured articles offer a peek at the outlook for a tech giant and for a videogame retailer. The prospects for a dental supplies provider and a streaming media giant are also examined. "User's Manual for a Mixed-Up Market" by Lauren R. Rublin is this week's cover story and part two of coverage of the 2017 Barron's Roundtable. The panel of nine experts shares why they see value in housing, health care, auto parts and infrastructure plays, where to find 6 percent yields and why the outlook for India and Japan is sunny. Their picks include Viacom, Inc. (NASDAQ: VIAB). In "Digital Ad Growth, YouTube Will Lift Alphabet 20%," Jack Hough suggests that Google is playing catchup in cloud services, helped by artificial intelligence and machine learning. And see what Barron's believes are two key milestones for advertising to watch for this year, and why Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) should be a major beneficiary of that. Can shares reach $1,000? Jack Willoughby's "Why GameStop Can Win Its Toughest War Game" takes a look at why, facing weak videogame sales, GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) has diversified by selling AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) phones and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) products. And the stock is very cheap for a company with strong cash flows to support its diversification plan and some growth catalysts. Investors collect a 6 percent dividend yield, too. Shares of veterinary and dental supplier Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ: PDCO) took a hit last year, and now they look undervalued, according to "Patterson Stock Could Return 20%" by David Englander. The end of a 20-year exclusive distribution relationship looks like an opportunity for investors, says Barron's, and increased profits and a higher stock price are bound to follow. In Emily Bary's follow-up story, "Don't Bet Against Netflix," Barron's admits that it underestimated the company's ability to build a worldwide customer base. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) has returned 300 percent since Barron's wrote about it in 2013. Risks remain for shareholders, says the article, but it is also risky to bet against Netflix — as long as it continues to beat subscriber expectations.

Views count: 295 Tags: bismarck rewane nigeria news Lequte Scientist Curators Following reports that FG wishes to grant investors in the power sector further tax holidays, the Chief Executive Officer, Financial Derivatives Company Limited, Mr. Bismarck Rewane, has stated that the sector needs a financial bailout, not a tax holiday. FG intends to stimulate investment in the sector by granting tax holidays to current investors. Rewane doesn't think this is the right decision. “A tax holiday only incentivises those who are making profit. These are loss-making entities right now, because they borrowed monies and borrowed in dollars as well. What the government should be doing is to look for how to bail them out rather than give them further tax holidays," he said according to Thisday. “Tax holidays are good for people who initially were profitable and all of a sudden became unprofitable, that is like Google, Facebook or MTN. Tax holidays helped them in investing more. Tax holiday is useful after the fundamentals of that industry have shown that the companies are going to be profitable. Right now, that is not the case. What these companies need is a financial bailout and interest moratorium to enable them cover their cost and invest additional capital in transforming the industry,” Rewane explained. Although CBN had created a special intervention fund for the power sector, Rewane said it is always "too little and it is never enough. So, they (government) need to do something really bold.”   Attached Files: Bismarck-Rewane-2306.jpg File size: 77.2 KB Views: 0 Lequte, Jan 23, 2017 at 6:34 AM #1 You may like Comments [You must log in or sign up to reply here.] Show Ignored Content Log in with Facebook Your name or email address: Do you already have an account?

GMGC’s awesome speakers delivered informative speeches on a wide range of topics including game development, mobile and technology industry, advertising, analytics, driving revenues, Japanese & Southeast Asian market, and even on the tech topic of viable sound design strategies for games. Dan Horan, David Song, Bam Aquino and Nix Nolledo at GMGC Manila “GMGC’s vision is to build a stronger gaming ecosystem, and our goal is not just to promote businesses, but also provide the platform for sharing of insights within the industry, and we have achieved that through this conference, Said Mr. David Song, Founder & CEO of GMGC. The Honorable Senator, Bam Aquino, was the guest of honor for the conference. During his opening speech he expressed his gratitude to “GMGC hosting the conference in Manila. I hope that developers will learn and explore more opportunities through the GMGC platform.” ADVERTISEMENT “Opportunities in the digital technology are ample here (in the Philippines). Southeast Asia is a huge market, but businesses need to think differently to get their games or products appreciated in the market.” said Mr. Nix Nolledo on the outlook of the region. 40 other speakers including Alvin Juban, President of GDAP, Gabby Dizon – CEO of Altitude Games, Daniel Horan – Commercial Director of Globe Telecom, spoke on the regional market as well as on the road map for the Philippines gaming industry. Derrick Mapagu – CEO of Most Played Games shared his hit game story with the audience. The discussions were inspiring, and gave the captivated audience plenty to think about. Awards presentation at Indie Pitch Arena 10 Indie developers participated in the Indie Pitch Arena competition this year; it was certainly a difficult task fo judges’ panel to decide the winner as all presented games were highly innovative, and well made. The games were evaluated and rated on the basis of user experience, content, features and modes, presentation and originality.  Springloaded won the grand prize for their game, “Nether Realms”, and the runner up was Minidragon for their game “Rainbowtail”. GMGC and leading market intelligence firm Newzoo launched the GMGC & Newzoo Mobile Games Whitebook for 2017 during GMGC Manila. The 20-page report examines the current state of the global mobile games market primarily in Southeast Asia, and was presented by, Newzoo CFO and Co-Founder, Thijs Hagoort at the conference. Xeleb Panel – Alejandro “Kuya Kim” Atienza, Erwan Heussaff, Raymond Racaza, Isabelle Daza, Anne Curtis-Smith The highlight of the event was a panel discussion by Philippines’s based celebrities from Xeleb included Anne Curtis-Smith, Isabelle Daza, Erwan Heussaff, and even Alejandro “Kuya Kim” Atienza. “It was my first gaming conference experience, and it was awesome” said Anne Curtis-Smith while talking to us. Casual mobile games that are themed or feature celebrities have started to take off in both the iOS App Store, and the Android market with notable examples include Hollywood stars, and Xeleb is quick to catch on this trend, and has developed a series of games based on the celebrities in the Philippines. The CEO of Xeleb, Raymond Racaza shared Xeleb plans to develop more games & venture into products outside of games. In addition, the exhibition floor gave ample of opportunities to the exhibitors & industry people to forge their businesses. The conference also held a vibrant networking party sponsored by Akamai, and held at the famous Sky High Bar in Manila. The rooftop party was undoubtedly a hit! It was a great evening for all of GMGC’s speakers, sponsors and attendees to mix up & network with each other over drinks. Overall, the attendees have gained deep insights and future trends in Southeast Asian& global gaming industry through all the sessions. Through GMGC Manila, the gaming industry around the globe had a great opportunity to get even closer!

Then, after a little bit of investigation, I found out why. Somehow, Adobe Flash was installed. After running outside and turning three times, spitting and cursing, I uninstalled it. You should do the same. Here's how. If you have Flash installed, first thing — breathe. It's OK! We all make mistakes. Even the best of us, like me. Just know that I'm here for you if you need help, if you want to vent. Next step — uninstall that fucker, quick smart. Flash is notoriously terrible. Google is trying to kill it, YouTube is trying to kill it, Mozilla is trying to kill it, even Adobe is trying to kill it. If you're running a Windows machine, visit here to download and run the Adobe Flash uninstaller. If you're on macOS, visit here. Run the installer, and you're done. To be fair to Flash, it wasn't the only reason that YouTube was being dicky on my PC. A bunch of weird Chrome extensions — my bad — were also at fault. But we don't have to be fair to Flash, because Flash is notoriously terrible. Not sure whether you have it installed? In lieu of going to visit a GP for a more general checkup, clicking either of those links above will tell you whether you're infected. [Flash] Comments anteaters @anteaters Jan 23, 2017, 4:30pm Do remember the good ole days of Flash before it became what it is today. Before Facebook, Youtube, the online games you would play, the animations you would watch. Reply 3 zak @zak Jan 23, 2017, 5:41pm Homestar Runner!

Reply 0 g-man @g-man Jan 26, 2017, 10:40am To many auto playing gif's on especially mobile devices can really bog it down while they all load. Plus being not very compressed can chew up data. Webm and others are much more data friendly use less resources and can display more colours. Like html5 is replacing flash. Webm really needs to replace gif. Last edited January 26, 2017 10:41 am Reply 1 Almost Guest Jan 23, 2017, 4:54pm I think of the unfortunate ones that have spent at least a decade of their lives getting good at Flash to find those skills mostly moot. Reply 0 benleffler @benleffler Jan 23, 2017, 6:51pm I beg to differ! The skills are not only transferable to Javascript, Swift and Haxe development, but they remain entirely relevant to the Adobe Air platform. Air is basically the Flash runtime packaged within an application wrapper that allows native performance, and rapid crossplatform development deploying to iOS (iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV), Android, Windows and OSX devices from the same codebase. (This is a huge plus for businesses managing their own codebase across different platforms) In fact stats from May 2014 indicate Adobe Air has over 100,000 unique apps and over 1 billion installs (these numbers will be much bigger now) and is second to only native Java as the developer platform of choice for Android apps. So yeah, while Flash is a dead-end on web IMO, most don't realise that it has evolved in to a highly robust crossplatform development base for mobile and desktop alike. Last edited January 23, 2017 7:12 pm Reply 0 sielinth @sielinth Jan 23, 2017, 8:23pm I hate air with a passion tbh and that's mostly because I'm in charge of patching. can you enlighten if there's a way to update air without needing the air application to be closed? I mean it's not like adobe releases an msi file like flash Reply 0 benleffler @benleffler Jan 23, 2017, 10:31pm I've been developing with Air for close to 6 years now and whilst it has it's problems like anything else, there really isn't anything else that is suited to rapid development of both games AND business applications whilst remaining a true crossplatform solution. Xamarin is good for apps, but terrible for games. Unity is the opposite side of that coin. Phonegap is horrible to work with and dev times always blow out. Native Java or ObjC/Swift is not crossplatform. ReactNative is promising as a business app platform, but that's as far as it goes right now. I couldn't tell you about updating the Air runtime as I usually package my apps utilising captive runtime. If I need to update the version of Air, I usually need to repackage the app and redistribute to the user base. Once you get the hang of the workflow, it's a piece of cake. Reply 0 ok @ok Jan 23, 2017, 5:05pm Ugh, Flash, just die already. Reply 0 chompers @evan Jan 23, 2017, 5:40pm Some things still use flash. Youtube has never had an issue in my experience, that really looks like an outlier. I have noticed that Win 10 can't seem to update flash, which is bizarre Reply 0 WhitePointer @whitepointer Jan 23, 2017, 7:38pm I still have Flash installed for precisely this reason...some things that I regularly use still use Flash. I'd love to get rid of it but I can't right now. However, I've never ever had an issue with YouTube. That issue would be more likely caused by the Chrome extensions Campbell mentioned at the end of the article rather than Flash. Reply 1 sielinth @sielinth Jan 23, 2017, 8:27pm if you're on 10 then Flash is updated via Windows Update, it's actually built into Edge, like google Chrome actually... which is why I find this article mildly confusing, a normal user don't uninstall flash from Chrome, it's not even remotely possible to do so I think, you can disable it though (chrome://plugins) the only reason to install flash on windows 10 is firefox (and maybe Opera / Safari, neither of which I use) Reply 1 edthecow @edthecow Jan 23, 2017, 6:02pm Plenty of TV catchup services still rely on flash (i.e. instead of having native smart-tv apps) so until they go html5 or native app my PC connected to TV will still need to have flash installed. Reply 0 fontgod @fontgod Jan 23, 2017, 11:07pm Yeah... ABC iView seems to still be using Flash. Reply 0 Ronald Frump Guest Jan 23, 2017, 6:44pm umm... and thank you Campbell for explaining why we should uninstall it...

Reply 0 ozoneocean @ozoneocean Jan 24, 2017, 1:16pm Not even close, he just didn't want to deal with a third party system on his devices. Cutting off Flash caused people to stop supporting it. Reply 0 ozoneocean @ozoneocean Jan 24, 2017, 1:15pm This is so silly. There's still so much great flash content out there, meanwhile HTML5 has quietly taken over as a great adware/malware delivery system/resource hog, badly doing video. The moral of the story is that there are no really good systems or services, they'll all vulnerable to issues or implemented badly by developers. Reply 0 Zombie Jesus @zombiejesus Jan 24, 2017, 6:53pm I'm fairly sure the HTML5 video playback issue was a browser issue related to VP9 codec support a while back, not an issue with HTML5 itself. I don't think any browser has the problem any more. Certainly on the latest Chrome, [email protected] HTML5 playback doesn't exceed 2% CPU on my system (i7 4770K, stock speeds). As far as security goes though there's a clear winner. Flash is orders of magnitude more dangerous than HTML5 because of the way it essentially operates as an installed program on your system and can access your full RAM content and file system. HTML5 lives within the browser's sandboxing and its attack vectors are limited to that scope. Just because HTML5 isn't flawless doesn't mean it's not significantly safer than Flash. Reply 2 ozoneocean @ozoneocean Jan 27, 2017, 1:55pm It also does not mean that it won't continue to have issues and become less safe as time goes on. Unfortunately that is the trajectory of all systems. Reply 0 beacham @beacham Jan 25, 2017, 12:21am Campbell, what browser do you use? Unfortunately it isn't physically possible to uninstall Flash from Chrome completely. Reply 0 Friendly Flash Guest Jan 25, 2017, 1:48pm "I've been having a hell of a time loading YouTube videos on my home PC recently." This was Flash's fault? Not your settings, Not YouTube's, not your browsers or an add-ons, not an advertisers, but Flash's. Even though as your own article states YouTube is HTML5 by default and Google has banned Flash ads. Yeah right. Flash, as a ubiquitous platform has been abused a lot. No doubt. Flash itself was first to bring most of the great “HTML5” features we all love to the Web and while its place on the Web is changing, it is still an important part of it. YouTube and many other Google products (Maps) started out in Flash. They’ve moved on, and other bits and pieces will and should too. Flash Player and more broadly, the Flash platform still have a place. High quality browser based games and video for instance. Why all the hate and bad language?

By Alexandra Steigrad on January 23, 2017 Share This Article Reddit LinkedIn WhatsApp Email Print Talk Condé Nast's New York office. Is this the week Condé Nast staffers have been dreading? Higher-ups at the New York-based publisher are said to have earmarked this week for the long-rumored consolidation of the business side of the company. Insiders pointed to three big meetings that will take place at the end of January as reason for the timing. Employees will gather on Jan. 31 for an all-staff meeting, following which Condé Nast International executives will have their meeting at the New York headquarters. A business staff meeting led by chief business officer and president of revenue Jim Norton will come after that. Norton, who is the architect of the business consolidation, was brought in late last year from AOL to slash costs and evolve the company’s digital business. The consolidation moves are believed to include a reduction of publishers and the promotion of key executives to the roles of chief marketing officer and chief revenue officer. (The word “publisher” is also expected to be replaced by the title of general manager and chief revenue officer in order to project an image of being less reliant on print even though the majority of Condé’s revenue continues to be derived from it.) Although it is still uncertain which publishers — or should we say “general manager and chief revenue officer?” — will remain in place, there appears to be consensus that Vanity Fair’s Chris Mitchell, Vogue’s Susan Plagemann and GQ’s Howard Mittman are part of a core team that will keep their current roles. (Mittman is rumored to be adding Golf Digest to his list of titles, as chief revenue officer Pete Hunsinger has left the company for a new gig.) The front-runner for chief marketing officer is Pam Drucker Mann, the chief revenue officer and publisher of the Food Innovation Group, which includes Bon Appétit and Epicurious, sources said. Lisa Valentino, the chief revenue officer of Condé Nast Entertainment and senior vice president of network sales for Condé, is expected by sources to be getting the title of chief revenue officer for the entire company. Meanwhile, Josh Stinchcomb, the senior vice president and managing director of 23 Stories, is likely to get an expanded role. The exact nature of that role could not be learned. Of course, with any consolidation comes layoffs. There already has been a considerable amount of cutting on the editorial side, as Condé Nast consolidated its creative directors, copy and photo editors. Restructuring on the publishers’ side naturally puts into question certain publications and their business leaders. It is rumored the firm is looking at further consolidating Glamour, Allure and Brides, for instance, and that W Magazine is expected to be rolled up into Vogue’s business side. But sources have indicated that such changes do not necessarily mean that publishers of the aforementioned titles would exit the company, as some would likely be offered new roles. Still, a few publishers will be let go in the shakeup, WWD has learned. And, newly promoted leaders will then begin assessing their teams and making their own adjustments. While Condé will likely — and justifiably — explain that all these changes stem from declining print revenues and the need to restructure the group to become more digitally oriented, there may be an even broader reason down the line. Several well-placed sources have speculated that Norton could be helping to prep the company for an eventual sale by its owners, the Newhouse family. Condé Nast parent company Advance did not respond to requests for comment on the sale rumors. Insiders told WWD that Condé has in the past held talks about a potential sale with selective companies. It could not be learned how serious those discussions were or whether they were merely theoretical — or whether they are ongoing. Should the Newhouses decide to sell what is considered the crown jewel in their Advance empire, sources said the most likely suitor would be longtime rival, and also family-owned, Hearst. They mused that Hearst would be able to consolidate the fashion and beauty advertising market while getting into new areas. All agreed, though, that a sale is not imminent. “There’s no truth to this,” a Hearst Magazines spokeswoman said of Condé as a potential acquisition target. Sources whispered that other possible suitors that have been speculated about at various points have included Apple and Google. But those rumors may be conflated by the fact that the publisher has inked deals with both companies. Apple, which is working with Condé Nast Entertainment, did not return requests seeking comment. Google, on the other hand, provided a pun-laden “no comment” that name-dropped several Condé Nast-owned titles. “You seem Wired into the latest chatter. We got some Backchannel from a New Yorker that this gossip was en Vogue. When your question came in and we Reddit, it made us quite Epicurious because your stories have some Allure. But Self-ishly we don’t comment on rumors (Glamour-ous or otherwise). Bon Appétit!,” the spokesperson offered. Maybe they Googled how to write a witty response. You're missing something!

Download Linux distro Tails 2.10 Linux nasty kicks weak, hacked gadgets when they’re already down Home news Canonical launches Ubuntu Tutorials news Canonical launches Ubuntu Tutorials By rascal23 - Jan 23, 2017 2406 0 Linux is arguably the most successful open source project in all of history. The success of the kernel — and operating systems that use it — are not due to any one man or woman. Actually, the achievements are thanks to the Linux community. In other words, it is a team effort — developers, users, and more. For a Linux distribution, such as Ubuntu, to continue its progress, Canonical needs developers to remain interested — this includes getting new people involved and educated. This week, the company launched Ubuntu Tutorials — based on Google’s open source Codelab. No, it is not self-learning for new workstation users, but for programmers and developers. “Ubuntu tutorials are a topic-specific walkthroughs, giving you a very practical experience on a particular domain. They are just like learning from pair programming except you can do it on your own! They provide a step-by-step process to doing development and devops activities on Ubuntu machines, servers or devices,” says Canonical.

Of course, we all started talking about restaurant (we all have our favorites) but the ladies present stirred the conversation to hair salons. Obviously, all discussed below applies not only to barber shops too, but also to a wider spectrum of businesses Why are we writing on Hair Salons today? If not often - at least sometimes, inspiration and best practices can come from the most unexpected sources. By the way, hair stylists/ hair dressers work in a type of business with a very high customer churn- rate. In that business, financial success requires keeping your 'beauty-chair' filled with clients all day long. Any successful hair salon has mastered the art of customer retention, and their secrets to their success are the type of lessons that are applicable to almost all entrepreneurs. . Who is your customer? Whether you are keen on Big Data Analytics or in love with all these KYC (Know Your Customer) 'paraphernalia' , these things are not realistic for a small businesses, especially starting ones or ones with small budgets (due to economies of reality). We identify the following types of Hair Salon/ Barber Customers: ⦁ The Plain Guy/ Girl. They just want to have their hair done, so thrills, no chat, no elaborate stuff. ⦁ The Queen/ The Big Boss. They expect to be treated like a Queen or King or any other kind of Royalty; they demand to be pampered and treated as they are the most important Customer- the ONLY important customer! That simple! ⦁ The Trendy One. Tell them about the latest hair style trends, new products, explained all this to them, make suggestions. These people are genuinely serious about learning and hearing all that stuff. ⦁ The Chit-Chatter. They view their Customer Experience as a social event. They seek a personal relationship with your business- they expect to be chatted constantly during their visit. Please them too please. ⦁ The Sophisticate/ the Inquisitive one. They have a simple expectation: tell them what you are going to go with their hair (i.e. explain to them in real-time who you are delivering your services) - they want to know and been kept 'updated' during the whole 'hair- process'. Sometimes this type of customer-type is 'combined' with any of the other 3 types above. Tip: we hope that it is obvious to you that these type of customers exist in all other sorts of business, whether a product- or service- offering business. Aren't you one of these for example whenever you visit a restaurant? . How important is Sex in Hair Salons? We are glad that we got your attention. With sex, we are referring to gender and not to the pleasurable act. We just want you to be aware that Gender can sometimes play a role in Customer Loyalty. In the case of a hair salon, a man usually wants his hair done and his loyalty would be to the salon and very rarely to the barber. Women bond with their hair stylists and tend to follow them to a new salon if they switch employer; it seems to be a best practice that if a female client has an appointment with a hair stylist who is sick today, it might be better to reschedule her appointment or let her know before you randomly schedule her with someone else. . Making your Customer Loyal. Besides classic customer satisfaction and high-level of hygiene (people do freak out for example when they see a dirty toilet, dirty towels and employees with dirty fingernails or body odor that tells that an employee has taken distance from daily showers. etc), here are a few tips. Train your people. Start with the basics: train ALL your employees in Customer Care and Customer Loyalty (or whatever you want to call that training) Know when to chat and how. The 'perfect' stylists should be able read their customers and know who has come to the hair salon and look forward to a long 'chit chatting' session. Of course there are those who prefer to relax and enjoy quiet time. If not sure- ask please. Give them the most amazing experience - from start to finish of course! And don't underestimate how much attention any customer can pay to every single details. It's all these miniscule details that do add indeed in a fully amazing customer experience. Customer experience is a differentiator and it does lead to Customer Loyalty. Exceptional customer experiences will not only create Customer Loyalty but also active promoters, who will recommend your business to others. Let them speak & hear them. Be transparent and mature and ask your customers to provide you with their honest feedback about what they like, what they really enjoyed and what they are not so positive about. Talk to them. Give them the opportunity to voice their opinions please. If you don't listen to them, your competitor will! Keep them informed and involved. Tell them in advance what you are about to do, get their customer agreement (e.g. if you think that their hair would look better a tiny bit shorter, ask them before you proceed cutting them); ask in a graceful manner for their continuous feedback. Offer them on- the- spot personalized discounts, while servicing the customer. It is a lot different to tell them about an ongoing discount than to offer them to do 'this thing' (whatever that is) with their hair at a discount the next time they will be visiting your salon. Obviously, implement a Customer Loyalty Program. Delivering value beyond their expectations. Yes, that simple and it is all about perceived value. Evaluate. Whatever practices you might chose to implement to increase Customer Loyalty, evaluate whether they really work for you, whether they are sufficient or even whether they need fine-tuning. That should be an ongoing process. When is the last time that you asked any of your customers how would they like to be served? . Remember: Customer Satisfaction is a just a First Step The reason that most small businesses are hung up on customer satisfaction and not loyalty is due to the perceived notion that once the customer is satisfied with a product or service, they will become lifetime buyers. In reality, the customer is most likely just hanging around in search of a better alternative. When such a customer stops patronizing the product, instead of critically analyzing the cause of the departure, more money is rather invested into another round of advertising and client acquisition. Then the newly acquired customers hang around till there is a better offer and they leave. And the cycle continues unabated with another round of customer acquisition. Small businesses must know that satisfying the client is indeed the first stage of the loyalty building process, but they need to invest more in maintain their relationship with the customer. Again always keep in mind -please- that a happy, delighted and satisfied customer is not 'automatically' a Loyal Customer . Can Automation Help? How? In 2017, almost anyone has access to SMS or WhatsApp. Sure you can use email, but the 'impact' it is not instant- it can be read in a second or in a day or even in a week if ever at all (don't assume that you will not end up at someone's spam folder or that you cannot get blacklisted by Google). Are you busy? Cool! So are your clients! And they do get forgetful – aren’t we all busy? It can't be that difficult to send someone an SMS or a WhatsApp message with a text like: 'Dear Madame (or Sir), it has been 8 weeks since you last visited us. Would you like us to contact you and book an appointment for you please?' (or something similar in content). Why will you do that? One simple reason please: to get your customer in sooner which means they spend more with you annual, this equals more money/ more cash flow for your business. A personalized approach like that, it is very likely to ensure and even increase customer loyalty. Isn't that what we should be after? Obviously you can do all sorts of SMS & WhatsApp promotions and run 'Specials' marketing Campaigns. But like the Ancient Greeks said: Παν μέτρον άριστον = Do everything in moderation. Don't bombard your customer please with overfrequent communication noise! . Back to 'personalization'… Don't you like it when at the very moment that you step into a (new) hair salon or any other business, you are greeted with a smile and possible a simple drink offer (that been water or coffee or tea)? How about when you receive an email or a message like “Great to to meet you” or "Thank you for trusting us with your hair, we hope thatyou like your new 'hair' (or whatever you want to call it)"? Or even a simple “Happy Birthday” message followed with a discount offer? Doesn't that create the sense of a great experience? Won't you feel 'compelled' to go back to that place again? By the way, when was the last time that the salon which you patronize did this? Hmmmmm.... Today there is no excuses for any businesses not to think about customer service and not to build Customer loyalty. Plus, there are so many tools are available that make it easy. For example, MailChimp (this is just an example not a recommendation!), and so many other tools can deliver emails or other form of messaging automatically even at set dates. Worth exploring it, please . How far can you go to get Loyal Customers? Powerful example: 'As a client of the W Salon in Burke, Va., you get a lot of perks: a cupcake as soon as you walk through the door, invites to runway shows, the inside scoop on the latest fashion trends and you won't be harassed by your stylist to buy more hair products — the salon has a "no oversell" policy. Instead, all products are sold through the salon's virtual W Magazine that customers can access through free WiFi internet' (source/ full article: http://www.businessinsider.com/brilliant-customer-service-is-driving-250-customers-a-month-to-this-high-end-salon-2012-3?IR=T ). That Salon gets 250 new customers per month - no data on Customer Loyalty though. . In Conclusion Whether you are the Hair Salon of this example or any other business, please invest the time to brainstorm and come up of unique ways to reach out to your customers. And make it genuine- show to them that you actually care about the customer and not their money. Remember, it is always the little things that matter most to all of us. Think differently! Find your own unique ways to make your customers Loyal ones! The Loyal Customer is a long term relationship and s/he would generate a constant stream of income over the years. So, would you really want 1000 Satisfied Customers? Or 1000 Loyal Customers? . Good Luck, Thank you Kwaku & Spiros .

Nick Whighamnews.com.au@NWWHIGHAM THE expectation of anonymity on the internet is an idea that continues to be revealed as something to believe at your own peril. Computer scientists at Princeton University and Stanford University are the latest researchers to show just how easy it is to trace our online activities even when we think our internet surfing is anonymised. The researchers were able to write computer programs that found patterns among anonymised data about internet traffic and used those patterns to identify individual users by matching them to their social media profiles. If you are active on various social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter or Reddit — which is a vast majority of Australian netizens — your profiles could theoretically, and rather easily, be used to match you to your anonymised internet browsing history. “Our work is indicating that web browser history is not as anonymous as one might of thought,” Stanford University researcher Sharad Goel told news.com.au. A group of 400 internet users volunteered their anonymous web browsing history to Mr Goel and his fellow researchers who were able to determine their identity with 70 per cent accuracy. They did so by using the computer program to identify patterns and cross-reference the web links people clicked on via social media with their browsing history. “If they had clicked on a lot of links (on social media) than we were more accurately able to identify them,” Mr Goel said. “Twitter in particular” was most useful in uncovering people’s identity. Researchers were somewhat surprised at the high degree of accuracy they were able to obtain using the method. “We had an intuition but it wasn’t clear to us if we’d get 10 per cent accuracy, 50 per cent accuracy or 90 per cent accuracy,” he said. Their findings provide another blow to the notion of online privacy and the research paper is scheduled to be presented at the 2017 World Wide Web Conference in Perth, Australia in April. What you click on when browsing Twitter could expose your online identity.Source:Supplied “Our approach is based on a simple observation: each person has a distinctive social network, and thus the set of links appearing in one’s feed is unique. Assuming users visit links in their feed with higher probability than a random user, browsing histories contain telltale marks of identity,” researchers wrote in the paper. Much of the information used in the study is readily available, researchers said. Anyone listening to internet traffic, companies involved in targeted online advertising, ISPs and a bunch of Australian government agencies all have access to browsing histories. “It is already known that some companies, such as Google and Facebook, track users online and know their identities,” said Arvind Narayanan, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton. But anyone with access to anonymised browser histories could conceivably use this tactic to de-anonymise the data and track people’s online activity. As the Australia government considers expanding access to the data collected under its metadata laws, Mr Goel said he hoped the research would compel ISPs to limit the amount of data they keep on customers. “We were trying to highlight some of the inherent risks involved in maintaining these types of histories,” Mr Goel said.

More like this Google Symantec Security Symantec carpeted over dodgy certificates, again You had one job ... and it wasn't letting test certs escape into the wild and then revoking them 23 Jan 2017 at 02:58, Richard Chirgwin Symantec has confirmed that it's revoked another bunch of wrongly-issued certificates. Andrew Ayer of certificate vendor and wrangler SSLMate went public with his discovery last week. The mis-issued certs were issued for example.com, and a bunch of variations of test.com (test1.com, test2.com and so on). On Saturday, Symantec's Steve Medin replied: “The listed Symantec certificates were issued by one of our WebTrust audited partners. We have reduced this partner's privileges to restrict further issuance while we review this matter. We revoked all reported certificates which were still valid that had not previously been revoked within the 24 hour CA/B Forum guideline - these certificates each had "O=test". Our investigation is continuing.” Medin said the company is still investigating what went wrong, adding that Symantec “will report our resolution, cause analysis, and corrective actions once complete”. Security bods will be watching to see whether there's any other fallout from the latest blunder. In 2015, Google blockaded certificates from a Symantec root, because it was not complying with the CA/Browser Forum's requirements. At that time, Symantec hit back saying the certs were mostly used for internal testing, or were issued to a small handful of legacy customers. Last year, Google brought the long-running question of certificate trust into sharp relief when it launched its Certificate Transparency site, letting the world see the whole list of certs it doesn't trust. Chinese CA WoSign found itself in an unwelcome spotlight when it issued a cert for GitHub to university sysadmin Stephen Schrauger. WoSign found itself sent to the naughty corner by Mozilla, Apple, and Google. That company had to promise a reorganisation to get itself back in the world's good graces. ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 10 Comments More from The Register Inside Android's source code... // TODO – Finish file encryption later Android 7.0's crypto sauce is 'half-baked' and Google promises to make it better, soon 22 Comments Trump's FBI boss, Attorney General picks reckon your encryption's getting backdoored This isn't going to end well 112 Comments Google Cloud unlocks key achievement Encryption got you down?

Amazon Is Getting Into VR Shopping With New Job Post Posted on Jan 19th, 2017 by Thomas Oliver News Virtual Reality <a href='http://pikachu.vr-zone.com.sg/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a7d8a4f0&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://pikachu.vr-zone.com.sg/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=10&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a7d8a4f0' border='0' alt=''/></a> <a href='http://pikachu.vr-zone.com.sg/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a9738f63&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE' target='_blank'><img src='http://pikachu.vr-zone.com.sg/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=241&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a9738f63' border='0' alt=''/></a> Virtual Reality isn’t going away anytime soon it seems. Last year, both Alibaba and JD.com announced plans to introduce a VR marketplace. Not a place to buy a VR headset mind you, but a virtual brick and mortar store so you can see the products as they would be in real life. Now, Amazon appears to be getting into the same market, with a very telling job posting on LinkedIn. What are Amazon’s VR Ambitions? Image courtesy: Barco Variety was the first to notice the job posting, which was posted 5 days ago at the time of writing. The position is based in Palo Alto, the unofficial capital of Silicon Valley, and it’s asking for a lot. The post is calling for extensive experience in Unreal, Unity, Interface design and a whole slurry of other skills. Specifically, this is for A9, the branch of Amazon dedicated to search and advertising optimisation. Put two and two together, and you realise that Amazon seems to have something very special in mind. Variety has said that Amazon declined to comment on the job posting, so what it entails is not entirely certain. However, since the American company is soon going to be competing directly with Alibaba, it stands to reason that they would want a direct response to what they have on offer. Image courtesy: JWT Intelligence Amazon has definitely chosen a great time to start hiring for this kind of experiment. Google is pushing their Daydream View headset aggressively with a significant price cut until next month. Samsung is definitely releasing the second iteration of the Gear VR sometime this year. Zuckerberg, even though he is currently defending his role in the Zenimax-Oculus fight at the moment, says that Facebook with invest at least US$3billion (S$4.28billion) into VR over the next decade. 2016 might not have been the year of VR developers wanted it to be, but no-one is cutting losses just yet. Image courtesy: Merchandising Matters Will we see Amazon’s virtual reality shop anytime soon? Of course not, as the position is unlikely to be filled anytime soon. However, these innovations move quickly. Before we know it, online shopping will finally have a similar feel to more traditional shopping.

But that is exactly what Taboola CEO Adam Singolda did in a recent article for TechCrunch. “Henry Ford famously said that if you asked people what they wanted, they wouldn’t have said ‘a car.’ They would have said – ‘a faster horse,'” Singolda begins. “I believe driverless cars are today’s equivalent of faster horses. A continuation of what exists – not a true category break. Predictable but not revolutionary enough.” Sorry Elon, driverless passenger drones will be the vehicular disruption of the future https://t.co/HTjwKbJjuq — TechCrunch (@TechCrunch) January 22, 2017 Musk’s Tesla Motors is a pioneer in electric and autonomous cars. In October, the company announced that all of its automobiles are now being manufactured with fully-autonomous hardware installed. Tesla touted the innovation primarily as a safety feature and a means of “accelerating the world’s transition to a sustainable future.” Tesla also suggested that fully-autonomous vehicles will make driving more efficient, make owning vehicles more affordable and provide “low-cost on-demand mobility” for those who do not own vehicles. “We are excited to announce that, as of today, all Tesla vehicles produced in our factory – including Model 3 – will have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability at a safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver,” read a press release posted on the company’s website. “Eight surround cameras provide 360 degree visibility around the car at up to 250 meters of range. Twelve updated ultrasonic sensors complement this vision, allowing for detection of both hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system. A forward-facing radar with enhanced processing provides additional data about the world on a redundant wavelength, capable of seeing through heavy rain, fog, dust and even the car ahead.” If that sounds impressive, check out what Tesla had to say about the new onboard computers it would be adding to help out with the autonomous hardware. “To make sense of all of this data, a new onboard computer with more than 40 times the computing power of the previous generation runs the new Tesla-developed neural net for vision, sonar, and radar processing software,” the press release continues. “Together, this system provides a view of the world that a driver alone cannot access, seeing in every direction simultaneously and on wavelengths that go far beyond the human senses.” Elon Musk’s “master plan” envisions automated #Tesla trucks, buses and cars: https://t.co/s1XDioULzl???? — Green City Media???? (@greencitymedia) January 13, 2017 Singolda, apparently, is not impressed. He acknowledges that he admires Musk as a fellow car enthusiast and respects him as a tech entrepreneur, but he thinks his interest in driverless cars is misguided. “Yes, in the future we will not drive ourselves,” Singolda says. “Machines will do it for us – but let me tell you — those machines will be looking down, from above, on the Interstate Highway System.” Singolda believes we will “skip driverless cars and go straight into driverless drones.” Of course, that is a possibility, but as the Inquisitr previously reported, at least a dozen auto manufacturers, including BMW, Kia, Volkswagen, and General Motors, plan on having fully self-driving cars on the road by 2020. That’s only three years away. While Amazon recently announced its first successful drone delivery, both Amazon and Uber have been focusing on autonomous automobile delivery systems. That is not to mention Google’s investment in self-driving cars or the fact that a Delphi autonomous car recently drove all the way across the United States, from San Francisco to New York City. The age of autonomous cars may be short-lived, but it seems like it is basically already here. Singolda argues that the age of autonomous passenger drones could still leapfrog over that of autonomous automobiles because passenger drones would be logistically easier to implement on a widespread basis. “Developing an autonomous drone is actually technologically easier than ground-based autonomous vehicles, which have to take into account pedestrians, low-quality roads, and unexpected objects,” Singolda writes. Ultimately, passenger drones probably will reign over autonomous land vehicles. We won’t have to wait too long to see.

However, it can become a complicated game searching new and exciting ways of enticing customers. With the current advancement in digital technology, the marketing game is increasingly becoming detail-oriented and high-tech, and even more personalized and human-centric. Mitch Carson has been a pitchman on Home Shopping Network, CBS Radio host, and is the CEO of Impact Products Marketing in Los Angeles, CA. Reach him at mitch@mitchcarson.com or http://www.mitchcarson.com The marketing megatrends of 2017 will help marketers reach more consumers directly by circumventing distractions and personalizing the marketing messages. These techniques are very appealing and can help marketers create more targeted, effective and profitable marketing campaigns. Below are the top seven trends that are guaranteed to take marketing to a whole new level in 2017. 1. Personalization Personalization in a marketing context simply means segregating your marketing content to appeal to different types of audience members based on their habits, preferences, etc. In the current world full of overwhelming information and not enough time to consume, personalizing marketing content can be a huge win for marketers seeking to earn the limited attention of their customers. Collecting as much data from your customers as possible is one of the best ways to segregate your audience and offer them a customized experience. The simplest example is collecting information on their date of birth and sending them a personalized birthday message on the due date. Remember how you felt the last time your insurance company surprised you with a birthday message on your birthday? 2. Native Advertising Customers, followers and viewers are getting smart to the tricks advertisers use. It’s therefore becoming harder to earn their trust and maintain their attention. Additionally, the diminishing penetration of many ads as a result of reduced organic reach on social media, ad blockers and the decline of banner ads will see the rise of native advertising in 2017. For starters, native advertisement involves integrating your advertising message into content that already offers value to viewers and readers. This makes it less destructive and more effective. So instead of just blasting your potential customers with ads, look for ways to weave your product and service offerings into a larger, more valuable narrative. 3. Marketing Automation Automation is increasingly becoming powerful and popular among marketers seeking to keep their business running past business hours. Automation uses tools, features and apps to put repetitive tasks on autopilot. Common automation tools include solutions for social media posting, email marketing, digital ads and SMS. Many digital marketers agree that automation is very important to the overall success of a marketing campaign. Apart from easing some tasks and saving time, automation can be a great way of cutting down expenditure on some tasks that would have otherwise demanded for more labour to be accomplished. 4. More live video Live videos are also becoming the favourite toy of the Internet. What started as a simple pilot project with Meerkat has now proven to be an effective and exciting form of engaging with the audience. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and YouTube have all since jumped onto the bandwagon and released their own versions of live video as well. Most of these networks are heavily promoting their live video offerings and it’s an approach that will clearly stand out in 2017 in this marketing industry that is already saturated with content. 5. Influencer marketing There is nothing that makes social media marketing more effective like a lovable social media personality recommending your product or service to his or her followers and fans. The main reason influencer marketing is on the rise in because people tend to trust recommendations from personalities they see as thought leaders. The right market influencers establish trust and credibility through each social media mention, post or advertisement. Influencers work with brands they genuinely believe in, and that trust and confidence is passed to their followers. Influencer marketing offers brands an opportunity to create a buzz through word of mouth using personalities that already have a following that follow and admire them. When influencers are carefully chosen and used effectively, they create a natural way to entice a target audience. 6. Chatbots When you hear of chatbots, you may probably be thinking of some annoying pop ups on a website that looks like it was pulled straight from the early 80s. Well, a chatbot is quite a sophisticated technology. It’s a product of advanced programming and artificial intelligence that provides users with personalized responses, new updates and more. Once enabled, chatboxes can answer customers’ queries with sensible and intensely analyzed but natural responses; think of them as your sales associate who never goes to sleep and is always ready with a prompt reply. If you can’t notice whether or not you are talking to chatbox, then it’s working as intended. iPhone has a very advanced chatbox called Siri and it uses voice recognition and deep-learning to respond accurately to users’ statements and questions. 7. Mobile marketing Mobil marketing is currently the third most used marketing channel. There is however need for businesses to put more effort in optimizing conversions on mobile. Nonetheless, mobile marketing has a huge impact on search marketing with engines such as Google encouraging and rewarding business with mobile responsive websites. More and more business are forced to implement adaptive platforms in order to get a slice of this lowly explored channel. As much as most conversions are still done on desktop, there are plenty of unexplored opportunities on mobile platforms that businesses are now looking to explore though a variety of mobile apps. The bottom line is to design a ‘responsive’, rather than a not responsive mobile’ website that will be able to seamlessly adapt to different platforms from desktops, tablets, and smartphones. Conclusion There you have it. Even though there are a few more promising marketing trends such as wearables and Internet of Things (IoT), the above seven are the major innovations to watch out for in 2017. For business owners and marketers, it’s important that you try out a combination of several of these trends and find out what balance works for you. If you are not utilizing at least three of the above named techniques, then your marketing strategy needs to be re-evaluated and brought to the 21st century. In the same breath, not all the above will work for your business. If need be, consider hiring a marketing strategist to hand-hold you through a few aspects of integrating modern marketing trends in your business.   Reads: 3374 Tweet Click here to receive daily news headlines from Caribbean News Now!

Photo: Bloomberg Computing devices and smart gadgets are set to evolve further with sleeker designs, better security and innovative features in 2017. Here’s a glimpse of how some technology companies are going about the task and trends like big data and security are aiding this evolution. What next for Apple’s productivity push? Having mended bridges with the likes of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) and Microsoft, and forged partnerships with the likes of Cisco and Deloitte, Apple is in the midst of making its most aggressive push into the enterprise ecosystem. These partnerships take care of the software side of things, but the conundrum remains with the hardware. There is a definite potential of cannibalization within the computing device line-up, with the MacBook Airs, iPad Pros and MacBook Pros fighting for a common demographic, for the most part. Apple will also have to contend with some amount of criticism in 2017, with the underwhelming upgrades to the MacBook Pro line-up—this at a time when Microsoft flexed its muscles with the Surface Studio. Nevertheless, the iPhone remains as solid as ever for enterprise users. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Photo: Reuters Microsoft’s Surface gambit: Revive the PC market? At a time when personal computer, or PC, shipments have been steadily declining, Microsoft seems to have taken it upon itself to set the benchmark in the ecosystem. And in the process, also show off what it is capable of. The Surface Studio all-in-one (AIO) with the Pixel Dial joins the Surface Pro and Surface Book portable Windows convertibles, and is indeed revolutionary. The 28-inch PixelSense display is believed to be the slimmest of its kind, and has 63% more pixels than a 4K TV. With prices starting $2,999 (Rs2,00,000 approximately), it isn’t going to fly off the shelves. Though arguably, the first time ever, Microsoft has started to beat Apple at the innovation and design games, but just how they follow it up in 2017 will matter a lot. Flexing of the muscles aside, the real utility will now need to stand out—and that holds true for the entire laptop and convertible market. Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Photo: Bloomberg Big data: It’ll be bigger While there is considerable focus on smart cities, public transport and smarter infrastructure, there remains an ever-increasing need for data to make these systems work. For example, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Ford Motor Co. are collecting the cellphone location data of as many as two million Boston city residents; the idea is to create near-instant urban mobility patterns which would otherwise have taken years to collect, decipher and work on. Big data will be ever so critical for corporations, governments and also for research, and this is what will drive productivity, innovation and collaboration. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be. Google’s Pixel hardware game: A new innings With the Pixel phones, there has been a constant emphasis on the ‘Made by Google’ aspect. It is clear that the software and services major wants to get into the hardware game, on its own terms. And so it has, wielding greater control over the successors to the Nexus smartphones. Finally, Android as a platform is shining through—unhindered, unwrapped and uncluttered. Pixel has shown just how good Android can be, but Google needs to fix bigger problems—the world is still buying Android phones made by the likes of Samsung, Motorola and a whole bunch of Chinese brands, and they have no control over that—customization, lack of software updates and more. Do we see an even bigger Pixel smartphone line-up, covering more affordable price points? AI2, a new system developed by researchers at MIT, uses machine learning to flag potential cybersecurity threats and attacks. Photo: Getty Images Security: Artificial Intelligence (AI) to prevent cyber-attacks? In today’s world, cybersecurity is managed by a combination of humans and machines, with the latter usually configured by the former, and there remains genuine room for error. This is where the researchers from the MIT, perhaps, have a solution for the future—a new system called AI2. It uses machine learning to flag potential security threats and attacks. The human element remains, but the new system can actually scan and flag a lot more data than any human can. Dell XPS 13 offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity. Dell’s ultimate ultrabook becomes flexible The Dell XPS 13 is perhaps the best ultrabook in the Windows laptop ecosystem. Earlier this month, at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the company unveiled an upgrade with newer Intel processors as well as more powerful specifications in general. According to a press release from the manufacturer, the product offers a 360-degree hinge for multiple productivity and viewing options using Continuum, 15 hours of battery life and excellent clarity with an amazing QHD+ (5.7M pixels) InfinityEdge touch display—another first for a 2-in-1.

This model, the Misfit Ray Fitness Tracker, has two major perks: It tracks all of your activities and it doesn’t require charging, as it operates on replaceable button cell batteries that only need to be changed about every six months. The device normally retails for $100, but is currently discounted to $70, saving you 30 percent. The Misfit Ray tracks steps, calories, and distance, as well as your other fitness activities such as cycling, soccer, tennis, basketball, swimming, and more. It’s also a sleep tracker, recording how much sleep you’re getting while breaking down the data into light and deep sleep results. You can also set sleep goals and alarms to ensure you’re getting the proper amount of rest your body needs. The Misfit Ray is water-resistant, so in addition to tracking water sport activities, it can be worn 24/7, providing a better overall picture of your health and fitness incentives. The Misfit Ray isn’t just a fitness tracker — it’s a smart device as well, allowing you to set vibration alerts for call and text notifications, personal alarms, and movement reminders to help you stay active. The wearable is equipped with a smart button and can pair to your other smart devices to control them from your wrist. It syncs with other fitness and health apps like LoseIt!, Runkeeper, MapMyFitness, and MyFitnessPal, as well as customization apps such as IFTTT. With a wide range of compatibility, including Apple, Samsung, Google, and Android devices, it’s easy to pair all your smart devices together and see your fitness results on your screen size of your choice. Lastly, the unique design of the Misfit Ray is hard to overlook. It’s crafted out of an anodized aluminum cylinder, features a multicolor LED progress display, and contains hidden 8-mm spring bars that allow it to be worn in a variety of ways. Wear it on your wrist as a regular, standalone fitness tracker or place it on any standard accessory, such as your favorite watch band, bracelet, or necklace. For a limited time, the Misfit Ray Fitness Tracker is available for $70 (a $30 or 30 percent savings) on Amazon. $70 on Amazon Also watch: Share

Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 21 January, 2017 23:00 - - - - print email Comments It's easy to dismiss the speculation that Apple is working on smart glasses. It's hard to picture Apple selling smart glasses. But it's also hard to picture them not doing it. If smart glasses become a popular and mainstream consumer electronics category, Apple will almost be required to enter the market as a fiduciary responsibility to Apple shareholders. Consider the plight of poor Apple. Smartphone margins are shrinking. The tablet market is flabby. Smartwatches aren't panning out as a mainstream platform. Apple TV is still not going to bring in huge profits. So Apple has to adapt and keep up with the evolution of consumer technology to continue to dominate the market as well as secure its growth. Also, the choice of smartphone in the future may be dictated by the use of smart glasses. If mainstream smart glasses require an Android phone, Apple could lose market share. What's certain is that Apple is working on smart glasses. Bloomberg reported in November that Apple was thinking about entering the "digital glasses" market. That report was based on anonymous sources, who said Apple is considering glasses that would go on sale next year and "show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality." ODG ODG's R-8 smart glasses give you what looks like a 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front of you. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. Apple would never make anything like this. The Financial Times reported early last year that Apple was building a large team focused on augmented and virtual reality, and had poached employees from Microsoft and Lytro. Intriguingly, Apple has made some augmented reality-based company acquisitions. Apple bought PrimeSense, which makes the sensor technology in Microsoft's Kinect. They also nabbed augmented reality startups Metaio, Faceshift, Emotient and Flyby. AR-related patents by Apple go back a decade. And tech blogger and evangelist Robert Scoble posted a rumor on Facebook that Apple may be working with Carl Zeiss on smart glasses. (I told you about Carl Zeiss Smart Optics technology in this space a year ago.) All that planning, thinking and spending may pay off for Apple when smart glasses go mainstream. And when I say mainstream, I mean totally mainstream. What if nearly all glasses were smart glasses? The company that makes your glasses is getting 'smart' The signs of the mainstreaming of augmented and mixed reality are everywhere. The biggest one yet happened earlier this week when French lens giant Essilor merged with Italy's eyeglass behemoth Luxottica in a $53 billion deal that will result in the world's largest glasses company, to be called EssilorLuxottica. Wait, Essilor? Luxottica? These aren't exactly well-known companies in tech circles. Let me introduce you. Essilor is the world's largest maker of corrective lenses. The company is strongly focused on research and introduced the world's first branded progressive lenses. You also may have encountered Essilor on its retail sites, FramesDirect.com and EyeBuyDirect.com. Your optometrist definitely has. The company runs the MyOnlineOptical e-commerce site for eyecare professionals. Essilor also unveiled last year a prototype of an augmented reality system for the visually impaired called MyEye, which enables any text to be read, converted to text and then read aloud to the wearer. And you're probably already a big Luxottica customer. The company sells under most of the mainstream brands you're familiar with, including Ray-Ban, Oakley, Vogue Eyewear, Giorgio Armani, Brooks Brothers, Bulgari, Burberry, Chanel, Coach, Dolce & Gabbana, DKNY, Polo Ralph Lauren, Prada, Ralph Lauren, Versace and many others. And you've likely shopped at Luxottica stores, including Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, Pearle Vision, Sears Optical, Target Optical, Glasses.com and others. So the world's biggest lens company is merging with the world's biggest frame company. Here's the best part: Essilor CEO Hubert Sagnières told the media that the purpose of the merger was innovation in "connected glasses," and the ability to deliver them "extremely fast to consumers through all the stores of the world and all [our] networks," according to the Financial Times. I'll refer you to the list of brands and stores above. That's where the world's largest eyeglasses company plans to deliver smart glasses, and fast. What's wrong with today's smart glasses? While lots of companies explore what's possible with the technology, and what's desirable among consumers, the field is really wide open for Apple and EssilorLuxottica. Consider what's out there. We all know about the splashy, high-end, mixed reality projects, including Microsoft's HoloLens and Magic Leap's big project. And, recently, we learned a lot more from CES. A San Francisco-based company called Osterhaut Design Group (ODG), which already sells successful industrial AR smart glasses, this month unveiled a sub-$1,000 pair for consumers called the R-8. The glasses connect to an Android phone via Bluetooth LE. The company claims that the glasses show two 720p screens that look to the wearer like one 90-inch 3D screen that appears to float 10 feet in front. The glasses also have two 1080p cameras. This is a great example of what's happening in the market generally. Current consumer smart-glasses products are either too high-powered and therefore bulky, too expensive, too ambitious or too narrowly focused -- for example, on sports performance. The Sony SmartEyeGlass, GlassUp UNO and Factory 4.0, Epson Moverio BT-300, Jins Meme, Recon Jet, Optinvent Ora-2 Professional Smart Glass, CastAR, LaForge Shima, Oakley’s Radar Pace and HiAR Glasses all fall into these categories. They're all too much on the face to be worn around all the time. Another emerging category are so-called smart glasses that measure brain waves. Safilo Group, which is the company behind Dior, Fendi and Hugo Boss glasses, is developing ordinary looking glasses that measure brainwaves, then send that data to an app where users can monitor their moods. Finally, of course, there is the already thriving enterprise smart glasses market. Chinese computer and smartphone giant Lenovo launched new smart glasses at CES. The company's Glass C200 product comes with a pocket unit that connects the glasses via high speed LTE mobile wireless. I told you about Osterhaut Design Group's consumer announcement. They also announced an R-9 for enterprises. We've been hearing about Vuzix's M300 Smart Glasses for enterprise for quite a while, but the product should go on sale this month. Why the market is wide open for Apple All the bulky, goofy, expensive smart glasses on the market now may find niches in gaming, drone-control, enterprise and other uses. But they won't go mainstream, and therefore won't change how we use our mobile devices. I wrote in this space about Vue glasses, which use bone-conduction audio and blinking lights to deliver communion with a smartphone and thereby deliver smartness. They offer neither screen nor camera. But they do offer one feature that makes them more mainstream than all the other products I told you about: They can pass for regular glasses. They also demonstrate a core feature of smart glasses that just about everyone overlooks. It turns out that glasses are a perfect place to deliver audio interaction -- a microphone and bone-conduction audio. Because glasses can hold a bigger battery, glasses are better than earbuds for interaction with a virtual assistant, such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant or Cortana. They can be worn all day, every day. They keep the ears unobstructed. And the battery can last for days between charges. For that reason alone I believe smart glasses are inevitable. Any subtle integration of a screen -- perchance a camera -- is frosting on the cake, so to speak. The weird thing about wearables is that they're fashion, with all the attributes of customization and personal identity associated with fashion. The tech sector has proved that it's not really up to the challenge of offering compelling fashion designs in wearables. But Luxottica is a fashion company. And, let's face it, Apple is too. Apple demonstrated as much with its Apple Watch, which comes in a dizzying variety of types, faces and bands. I think the world of mainstream smart glasses is coming. These glasses will have to look just like regular prescription glasses and sunglasses. And you'll be able to order them as a check-box item whenever you get your regular glasses. When you think of smart glasses as ugly, bulky and dorky like today's smart glasses, it doesn't seem like Apple would enter the market. But when you realize that tomorrow's smart glasses will look like ordinary glasses, that they'll be mainstream consumer devices, and that they'll be luxury fashion goods, it's clear that Apple will definitely want to get a share of the market.

By David Trayner / Published 23rd January 2017 NC SUSPECTS: The men – pictured here – hold what appears to be a gun A woman was allegedly gang raped in Sweden – with the three-hour attack streamed live to a closed Facebook group. Horrified witnesses say men armed with guns tore off the victim’s clothes before sexually assaulting her. NC COP: A policeman's arrival at the scene is captured on the webcam “He pulled her clothes off and lay on top of her” Josefine Lundgren Police arrived and turned off the camera after a viewer reported the attack. Josefine Lundgren, 21, called the police after realising what she was watching. She said: “He pulled her clothes off and lay on top of her.” Four black youths were charged after streaming the alleged torture of a disabled white man on Facebook Live earlier this month. NC WITNESS: Josefine Lundgren called police after seeing the footage online Another unnamed member of the closed group told local media: “The first thing you think is ‘How can you do such a thing to a girl? And how can you do it live when you know that you are going to go there?' “I think of course it is screwed – totally sick.” The woman was apparently close to being unconscious when the men set upon her in the town of Uppsala, near capital Stockholm.

Investors who had feared tough action on drug pricing under a Hillary Clinton presidency believed Trump would be the safer bet. Not so. At Trump’s presser, he announced that “the drug industry has been disastrous,” adding that he planned to create new bidding procedures for drugs to “save billions of dollars” for Americans and would do the same with other industries, sending stocks into a swoon. “We are dealing with a completely unpredictable, absent-minded man who may wake up on any given day and just decide to attack a stock he hates—or praise one he loves—and then turn around and change his mind,” says David Tawil, president of Maglan Capital, a New York event-driven hedge fund. “I don’t like that. Those are 50-50 odds. I would never play that. No one would, unless they had some inside track. The one thing we hate is binary potential.” Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week Donald Trump speaks during his press conference at New York's Trump Tower on January 11. Shannon Stapleton/Reuters It’s not so much that Wall Street investors necessarily object to Trump’s plans per se. It’s that the president-elect tends to announce them via highly nontraditional channels and without warning—more often than not, to his 19.7 million Twitter followers at all hours. As a result, major Wall Street traders and everyday investors are racing to find ways to stay on top of his constant tweets, from keywords to algorithms to analytics that track social media. While banks and hedge funds have invested millions of dollars in trading systems that can be tweaked to “Trump-proof” their portfolios, solutions for ordinary investors have been few and far between since Trump won the election. That changed this month. One of the easiest tools to use (and it’s free) is a new app called “Trump Trigger” from Trigger Finance Inc., which offers market information and trading alerts. The app will send a message to users whenever Trump tweets about a stock they own, with options to buy, sell or short. “While it’s no surprise that Trump has been actively tweeting since the election, no one anticipated that a single tweet could potentially eradicate billions of dollars in market cap from large companies,” the company wrote in a blog post last week, introducing the app. Fidelity Investments also offers a feature called “Social Market Analytics” that investors can add to their trading dashboards to track trading signals via Twitter, Facebook and other social media. The analytics tool does this by measuring both positive and negative comments on social media versus the norm. Sentiment indicators culled from social media are increasingly pointing to events before they happen. This was true when Trump complained in a recent tweet about the high cost of F-35 fighter jets from Lockheed Martin, sending its stock price lower. In fact, Trump’s Twitter followers goaded him into going after Lockheed after he tweeted in December that he wanted to “cancel” plans for a new Air Force One from Boeing, because “costs are out of control.” Ever the crowd-pleaser, when his followers urged him to attack Lockheed too, that’s exactly what he did. Related: Trump business plan casts spotlight on law firm that worked for Russia What’s interesting is that Twitter sentiment indicators for Lockheed shot into negative territory and the company’s trading volume spiked even before Trump’s tweet, because social media had already gone negative on Lockheed hours earlier. Trump’s tweet was just the coup de grace. One big worry: What if Trump’s tweet storms lead to a market that becomes hopelessly reactive to politics instead of economics? A former “bond king,” Bill Gross, who runs the $1.7 billion Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund, alluded to just that. He compared Trump’s penchant for singling out certain corporations and bullying them into changing their practices as redolent of the Italian dictator Mussolini. “Some of these pre-term policies, where [Trump’s] cajoling companies to move production back into the United States, that’s fine, but it reminds me to some extent of policies in Italy long ago associated with Mussolini and government control of corporate interests,” Gross said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio. “I don’t want it to go too far.” Of course, it could also go too far in the other direction. “At some point, Trump could lose all credibility, both domestically and internationally, where no one takes him seriously anymore,” a London-based trader tells Newsweek on the condition of anonymity because the trader isn’t authorized to talk to the press. “Being the president-elect might give his tweets weight now, but that won’t necessarily last if he wears out his welcome.” On Thursday, Trump abruptly praised L.L. Bean in a tweet after hearing that the granddaughter of the Maine company’s founder, Linda Bean, had donated thousands of dollars to a political action committee that supported his presidential campaign. Most of Trump’s tweets since winning November’s election, however, have been negative. Among the companies he’s tweet-bombed in addition to Boeing, Lockheed Martin and General Motors are Amazon, Apple and Carrier, a unit of United Technologies. With this week’s presser, Big Pharma is now on his hit list. Attention from Trump has not been beneficial for most companies, so many investors are actively shirking the stocks he obsesses over. “I am staying as far away as I can from any sectors that Trump seems to be focused on—financials, pharma and the auto industry’s biggest carmakers, I am staying away from it, consciously, yes,” says Tawil. Karen Finerman, co-founder and chief executive of New York investment management firm Metropolitan Capital, says she’s invested in a number of stocks that could be affected by Trump’s running commentary, including tech issues like Facebook and Google’s holding company, Alphabet Inc. (Silicon Valley largely favored a Clinton presidency over Trump) and financial stocks like Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup. Related Stories Trump Meets U.S. Defense Contractors He Criticized Trump Business Plan Law Firm Also Worked for Russia Trump Takes Aim at the F-35, the Costly Fighter Jet But the stock Finerman is most concerned about is GM, she says, even though the company’s most recent earnings beat expectations. “That’s the one where I am most tweet-vulnerable, so I guess I am a little nervous,” she says. Finerman did well with tech issues, which initially got crushed after Trump’s victory but edged up after he met with Silicon Valley kingpins in the Trump Tower in December. “When the tech stocks fell, we kept buying as they kept getting cheaper,” she says, “so we did well on that." In other words, when companies take a hit due to Trump that are otherwise healthy, it could be a good buying opportunity. Even so, Wall Street will continue to be extremely wary of what traders are calling “the Trump Effect.” “The only way you can truly insulate yourself from any potential fallout,” Finerman says, “is to not own any stocks.
