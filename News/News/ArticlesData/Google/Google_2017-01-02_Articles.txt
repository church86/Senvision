The region and its 500 million consumers represent one of the companies’ most important overseas markets. And in cities like Lisbon, Portugal, and Ljubljana, Slovenia, people often can’t get enough YouTube videos, Amazon purchases and Twitter messages. Yet policymakers in the 28-member European Union have also become some of the most ardent critics of how Silicon Valley companies dominate much of the digital world. The criticisms include the companies’ perceived failure to pay local taxes and their collection of reams of personal information. These tensions took center stage in 2016: Apple was ordered to pay about $13.7 billion in back taxes to the Irish government; Google was accused of unfairly favoring some of its digital services over those of rivals; and Uber was prohibited from operating some of its ride-booking services in the region. The companies deny wrongdoing. The next 12 months are shaping up to be potentially even more painful. Many of the investigations that started in 2016 will be decided in the coming year. If Silicon Valley companies lose the battles, they could be forced to change how they operate not only in Europe, but also farther afield. Here is what awaits in 2017. Google: The Mountain View company is facing three sets of antitrust charges in Europe related to some of its search services and Android, its popular smartphone operating system. The first set of charges — linked to accusations that Google unfairly promoted its shopping product over those of rivals — could be decided by early spring and might lead to a fine of up to 10 percent of the company’s global revenue, or about $7.5 billion (though most penalties are significantly less). The company has repeatedly denied that it favors its own services over those of others, and it is spending close to a half-billion dollars across Europe to endear itself to locals. Any appeal of the decision would take years. Google’s European woes also extend to taxes, and French officials will most likely decide this year if the company must pay more than $1 billion in back taxes on its operations there. It also has appealed a decision by France’s data protection regulator that it must apply the Right to be Forgotten rule across its global domains, including those in the United States. That allows people with connections to Europe to ask search engines to remove links to online content about themselves, under certain circumstances. The appeal will be heard in this year. Apple: On the top of Apple’s agenda in 2017 will be its appeal of the $13.7 billion tax bill. Lawmakers in Ireland are also appealing the decision, claiming that the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, overstepped its jurisdiction and that the Cupertino company did not receive preferential tax treatment. Both appeals are expected to be heard by Europe’s top courts in late 2017, at the earliest. The cases will most likely take on an increasingly political angle. President-elect Donald Trump has suggested that U.S. companies with significant cash held overseas might be able to repatriate these nest eggs at a reduced tax rate. If Trump goes ahead with this plan, expect a standoff between American and European lawmakers over where such money — including from Apple — should be taxed. Facebook: The social media giant is becoming an increasing target for European officials because of its ever-expanding role in the region’s economy. In 2017, Facebook will face the outcomes of investigations in France, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands about how it tracks both members and nonmembers who use the company’s services and visit third-party websites with embedded Facebook “like” buttons. The Menlo Park company won a similar case on appeal in Belgium. Facebook also has until the end of January to respond to European charges that it misled regulators when it sought approval for its $19 billion takeover of WhatsApp, the Internet messenger it now owns. Amid concerns that Facebook did not sufficiently clamp down on fake news during the U.S. presidential election, the company has faced similar worries in Europe, where some officials have called for it to be held responsible for such content, and for hate speech. In March, a German task force will report on how Facebook and other social media companies have responded to these issues. Legislation could follow if lawmakers believe the companies have not done enough. Uber: The San Francisco ride-hailing company has been locked in a years-long struggle to operate freely across Europe after some taxi associations and policymakers accused it of flouting local rules and promoting unfair competition. In April, the European Court of Justice, the region’s highest court, is expected to rule on whether Uber is a transportation service or a digital platform — a decision that will have far-reaching consequences. If Uber is deemed a transportation service, it will have to comply with Europe’s tough taxi rules and would not be able to offer some of its low-cost services. If the court rules Uber is a digital platform, the company will have greater ability to expand aggressively in the region, one of its more important international markets. Amazon: The Seattle e-commerce giant is awaiting the results of a lengthy investigation into whether it received unfair tax treatment from authorities in Luxembourg, where it has its European headquarters. Amazon denies the charges and says it complies with the tax rules where it operates. An outcome is expected by early summer at the earliest and follows similar tax cases against U.S. companies like McDonald’s and Starbucks. In a sign that it was trying to get ahead of the issue, Amazon announced in 2015 that it would start paying taxes in a number of European countries where it has large operations, instead of funneling nearly all of its sales through Luxembourg.

Ron Amadeo - Jan 3, 2017 11:05 pm UTC Enlarge / This is the current version of Uconnect, but the Android version should look a lot like this. FCA reader comments 84 Share this story Ars at CES 2017 I have seen the future: Alexa controls everything Sim racing hits the big time with the $1 million Vegas eRace BMW concept car interior puts holographic controls at your fingertips Taking a ride in Nvidia’s self-driving car Concept-i is Toyota’s friendly future View more stories At CES 2017, Google and Fiat-Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) are demoing a concept infotainment system based on Android 7.0 Nougat. This isn't the first time Android has been twisted into a car infotainment OS, but it is one of the first times Google is heavily involved in the process. The project is the next step of Google's "Android Automotive" initiative—a version of Android built as a car infotainment OS. Remember "Android Automotive" is a different product from "Android Auto." Android Auto isn't an operating system. Like Apple's CarPlay, it's a "projected" car interface—the software runs on the phone and uses the car screen as an external monitor. "Android Automotive" is Google's plan to make Android into a fully-fledged car operating system. Google's plan would be to sell Android to car OEMs exactly the same way it sells Android to phone OEMs. Google gives away the base operating system for free and entices OEMs with killer Google apps like Google Maps and the Play Store. The catch is that the Google apps are proprietary, and licensing them from Google means signing a contract to follow Google's compatibility rules and bundle all applicable Google services with the device. Phone OEMs that do this are part of the Open Handset Alliance, and Google is hoping that automakers will want to be active members of the Open Automotive Alliance. With the Google/FCA project, we're seeing another analog to the world of smartphones: custom OEM skins. On this demo, Android sits hidden behind a wall of FCA's "Uconnect" interface. At Google I/O 2016, Google showed off a Maserati Quattroporte with an in-car Android OS, but that had a slick Material Design-inspired interface. That made it more like the "Nexus" (or Pixel) of cars—it was pure Google design showing what was possible. In the market, car manufacturers will want to replace this with a unique, branded interface, which is what FCA has done with Uconnect. With Uconnect functioning as basically the FCA version of Samsung's Touchwiz, this makes it the most realistic version of what a commercial Android distribution for cars would look like. So what's the point of Google being involved if carmakers are just going to replace Google's interface? First, being based on Android 7.0 means this is a rare infotainment system that is using a semi-current version of Android. Vehicle development pipelines are several years long, so car manufacturers that roll their own Android infotainment system often ship versions that are woefully out of date. Honda and Hyundai, for instance, both ship Android-based infotainment systems today, but they're using Android versions from 2012. Google's Director of Android Engineering Patrick Brady says Google is "committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform," and presumably with Google's involvement there will also some kind of plan for updating the OS after the sale. While updating Android on phones is a continual problem compared to iOS (and really, any other major operating system), even Android's current system would be a huge improvement over the way the auto industry does things. The other benefit of involving Google is that slew of killer Google apps. FCA's Uconnect system is "built for connectivity and compatibility with the universe of popular Android applications"—it's the first car OS with the Google Assistant built-in, and it comes preloaded with Google Maps. It also features "popular Android apps" like Pandora, Spotify, NPR One, and Pocket Casts. In the future, Google will also have to build some kind of app store if the usual Android playbook is anything to go by. This is the second time Fiat-Chrysler has teamed up with an Alphabet subsidiary. FCA is also making a fleet of self-driving minivans with Waymo, the newly-renamed self-driving car division of Alphabet. The new "concept" infotainment system is built inside a Chrysler 300, and it will be on display at CES. The show floor opens January 5.

Good times, but compared to the ODG R-8 smartglasses Google’s now-defunct specs seem decidedly prehistoric. Unveiled during the Qualcomm CES 2017 press conference in Las Vegas the R-8 smartglasses offer AR (augmented reality), VR (virtual reality) and mixed reality viewing experiences – basically they give you a glimpse of the future of vision. The R-8 boasts a 40 degree field of view (FOV) and a HD resolution and allow consumers to “access the familiarity of movies, sports, gaming, navigation and education experiences on smartglasses that are lighter, smaller and sleeker.”  There were also a set of enterprise-focused smartglasses announced too, with the ODG R-9 featuring a 1080p full HD resolution and 70 degree field of view.  We’re still waiting to hear about the ODG R-8 release date and price, and we’ll update this story once we know the details – but with its predecessor (the R-7) costing $2,750 (around £2,250, AU$3,800) don’t expect an affordable price tag this time around.

Here's how to enable and use them. Smart Home by Taylor Martin January 3, 2017 2:28 PM PST @caspertek Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home Earlier this month, Google unveiled Actions for Google Assistant. Actions are a lot like Skills for Amazon's Alexa speakers in that they allow third-party developers to easily integrate their apps and services with the brains of the Google Home speakers. This means that if you want support for a device or service with any Google Assistant device, like the Google Home or Pixel phones, you won't have to wait for direct support from Google. Instead, developers can begin integrating with Google Assistant right now, and many already have. These Actions allow you to call an Uber, order a pizza from Domino's or play games using Google Home. Here is how you can begin using third-party services on Google Home now. Actions for Google Assistant Enlarge Image Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET The first third-party support to come this month was Netflix, which lets you throw your favorite Netflix shows and movies to a nearby Chromecast. However, many more services have since been added to the rapidly growing list. Currently, there are 51 services available in the Google Home app. Below are 10 of the most notable: CNBC Domino's Food Network NBC News NPR One Quora The Wall Street Journal Todoist Uber WebMD How to use Actions on Google Home Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET Enlarge Image Photo by Taylor Martin/CNET Many of these third-party services simply work out of the box, which is one of the major differences between Actions for Google Assistant and skills for Alexa. You must manually enable any skill you want to use with Alexa, which makes skills feel more like apps for your Alexa speaker. On the other hand, with Google Home, most published Actions are available to use as soon as they're in the Services section of the Google Home app, no setup required. For instance, to play the Akinator game, you never have to enable anything on Google Home. Just say, "OK Google, let me talk to Akinator," and the game will begin. It feels much more like vertical integration, like your Google Home is just getting smarter every day. That said, some services, such as Uber or Todoist, do require you to link your account. To do this, open the Google Home app on your iOS or Android device and tap the hamburger button in the top left corner of the app. Select More settings and tap Services. Scroll to find the service you want to activate and tap on its name. This will load the details page for that service. Tap Link Account and follow the on-screen instructions to authorize your account. To use any of the services available, you need to know the invocation for it. You can look up how to interact with a service by opening its page in the Services section of the Google Home app. Some examples of how to launch or interact with that Action will be shown at the bottom of the page. In many cases, as long as you know the name of the service, you can just ask Google to let you talk to it. For example, you can say, "OK Google, let me talk to Domino's," or, "OK Google, talk to Good Code Tips" to launch one of the services. From there, the Action will walk you through how to use it with voice prompts.

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (Bloomberg) - Car-electronics supplier Delphi Automotive went coast-to-coast in 2015 in a self-driving Audi Q5 sport-utility vehicle to prove the autonomous automobile had arrived. Now, Delphi is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, the company will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. “The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, ‘Look what it can do,’ ” said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of advanced engineering. “This year, the discussion is all about the path to production.” Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it’s in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens Jan. 5, the talk won’t be about proving technology — it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. “We’re close to bringing this to a lot of people,” John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. “We’re kind of at an inflection point.” At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21 percent more than last year. Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomous vehicle business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42 billion by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. “CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era,” said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield.” One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. “Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer’s mind,” Wakefield said. “Then when you come out with one, it’s like, ‘Oh, you make one, too?’ ” Google’s self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than two million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn’t yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Unlike traditional automakers, Alphabet’s businesses tend to focus on recurring revenue streams, such as search ads. Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. “Google’s playbook here is well-tested,” said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer of Zendrive, a transportation data startup, who formerly worked on Android. “They understand how to use the platform to create dominance.” Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the backseat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which said last week its test-fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. “Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure,” Wakefield said. “As they gain confidence and think, ‘Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,’ GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise.” It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. “The high cost isn’t solved yet,” Wakefield said. “There’s not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two.” The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “It took air bags 15 years to get high penetration in cars,” Jonas said. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla — which doesn’t exhibit at shows such as CES — may be the biggest accelerant for autonomy. Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which pressures other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. “Tesla is being a disrupter,” Wakefield said. “Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product.” Autonomy also is getting a boost from U.S. regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. “Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule,” said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now “you’re going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers.” For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70 percent, De Vos said. “The economics are really compelling,” said De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi’s driverless car in Las Vegas. “After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers.” Filed under: Auto Print Email Gmail Related Tesla Crash Could Hurt Sentiment on Driverless Cars Michigan Moves to Not Require Human in Driverless Test Cars Google Driverless Cars to Hit Public Roads Within 5 Years, Project’s Director Says California Mulls How to Regulate ‘Driverless Cars’ A Google-Ford Partnership Pushes the Evolution of the Driverless Car More in Technology Cancer Patients Sometimes Can’t Get Coverage at the Hospitals They Want Research: Daydreamers More Vulnerable to Sleep Deprivation SpaceX Launches First Rocket Since Explosion, Returns Stage to Earth Members of Congress from Ohio, Oklahoma Move to Block D.C.’s Right-to-Die Law CVS Selling a Generic EpiPen at One-Sixth the Price OP-ED A ‘Good Relationship’ With Russia Shouldn’t Be Trump’s Priority Don’t Defund the U.N. — Find Other Ways to Help Israel The Zeal to Repeal When Words Sprout Wings P.M.

News Opinion Entertainment Taiwan Living Learn English E-Newsletter International Edition Monday January, 16, 2017 About Us Subscribe Advertise Contact Us Taiwan Foreign Community National Local Foreign Affairs China-Taiwan Relations Business Arts-Leisure Analysis Asus phone details leaked ahead of Consumer Electronics Show By Christine Chou, The China Post January 4, 2017, 12:05 am TWN SHARE CLOSE Blogger   Google+ Live Journal   Plurk Stumble Upon     Tweet TAIPEI, Taiwan -- A press release from Qualcomm inadvertently revealed that Asus' new smartphone, likely called ZenFone AR, will be Google Tango-enabled and Daydream-ready. As of press time, the statement has been taken down from Qualcomm's website. The leak comes ahead of Asus' scheduled product announcement at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017. If the report proves true, the new smartphone would be the first in the world to support both Tango — a new technology from Google that enables augmented reality (AR) gaming and utilities – and Daydream, a VR platform developed by Google. Given the Jan. 4 date stamp on the leaked press image and a press event that Asus had scheduled on that date, market watchers believe Asus will likely make an official announcement for the upcoming smartphone on Jan. 4. "With Zenfone AR and the Daydream View headset and controller, you'll be able to explore new worlds with apps like Google Street View and Fantastic Beasts, dive into your personal VR cinema with YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and HBO, and get your game on with Gunjack 2, LEGO BrickHeadz, Need for Speed and dozens other titles," the Qualcomm statement read. ZenFone AR is expected to be the world's second handset to include Tango, following Lenovo Phab2 Pro that was announced last June. The press release said the ZenFone AR would be powered by the Snapdragon 821 processor. Following the press release, leakster Even Blass tweeted a picture of the upcoming Asus ZenFone AR, showing a sophisticated camera setup on the back panel. Recently, Asus CEO Jerry Shen (沈振來) hinted that ZenFone AR would be available as early as February, saying it would come with "advanced performance and functionality at a competitive price."

Union Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad will join Pichai and other senior leaders from Google, which is expected to begin at 11 am.  At the event, Pichai is expected to make announcements regarding the company's new initiatives aimed at helping the digital operations of small and medium business enterprises. "Small and medium businesses are the backbone of the Indian economy and are powering the next wave of the country's growth. At Google, we are excited about partnering with businesses to help them unlock exponential growth through the power of digital," Google said in an invitation. The invite for the event hints that it will also be attended by entrepreneurs and businessmen. "We invite you to join senior leaders from Google, the industry and business owners like yourselves, as we shine the spotlight on the Indian SMB ecosystem and delve into how digital can be a game changer for your business," the notes on the invite read.   Google has been aggressively focussing on the Indian market over the last few years. With products like Google for Business and a new Cloud region, the company is betting big on tapping into the multi-million dollar opportunity in India. Its products compete with those from the stables of global giants like Microsoft and Amazon Web Services.  Seven Indian startups recently joined the third batch of Google “Launchpad Accelerator” — a platform which brings together mentors and experts from Google and outside to help the startups see success — along with startups from other countries. Over the last one year, 13 Indian startups have participated in the programme and some of them have successfully raised funding. Pichai, who is on his first official trip to India after taking over as Google CEO, will visit his alma mater, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur on Thursday morning.

Jack Wallen shines up his crystal ball to predict what he believes will be the platform's biggest year to date. By Jack Wallen | January 3, 2017, 1:20 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Jack Wallen The mobile landscape is toppling the desktop beast. With more and more users turning their backs on traditional methods of interacting with software, the major players in the market continue to see higher demands on productivity and power. And with our feet firmly planted in 2017, it's time to make bold predictions as to where this year will take the Google mobile platform. SEE: Mobile Device Computing Policy (Tech Pro Research) 1: Android will hit 90% market share. More about Mobility Goalmap: Set and track goals easily via this Android app How to improve the security and privacy of your iPhone: 5 steps Alibaba's YunOS overtakes iOS in China, but what is it? Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter Android has continued to climb up the global market share ladder, thanks to manufacturers, such as OnePlus, selling unlocked devices. This year I believe we will see a major milestone in the mobile ecosystem; I predict Android will finally break the big 90% mark. There are a number of reasons I'm certain this will happen. The first reason is Google (more on that in a bit). Another reason for this landmark will be a lack of innovation from Apple; the big "A" will continue to play it safe (as they did in 2016), and more users will migrate to Android because of this. Couple this with the increased performance and battery life found in Android 7, and the Linux-driven mobile platform will easily climb the next rung in the global dominance market's ladder. SEE: Android nears 88% global market share, but Apple still makes more money (TechRepublic) 2: Google's Pixel will dominate the smartphone market. Another reason Android will dominate 2017 is the device designed by Google: the Pixel. Not only is this device the most powerful smartphone on the market, it also brings to light features that people will want. One feature in particular is Assistant. Google is the first company to bring an AI-centric digital assistant to life and do it right. With the power of the Pixel driving that feature, this device will continue to be one of the hottest on the market. And when the Pixel 2 releases, Google will only improve on everything they already perfected and crush the flagship competition—with one exception (more on that in a bit). SEE: Google Pixel phone: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) 3: A next-gen Pixel chromebook will meld Android and Chrome OS. The Pixel chromebook seems to have gone off the radar; you cannot buy them, and I believe that is because Google has something uber secret they are working on. By the end of 2017, I feel certain we are going to see the next-gen Pixel chromebook arrive as the first true melding of Android and Chrome OS. The next iteration of the Pixel chromebook will be very Assistant-centric, and it will be the single most powerful chromebook to date. On top of that, the device's design aspect will blow the competition out of the water. I predict this device will sell out faster than any piece of hardware ever created by Google. SEE: Chromebooks: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) 4: The lines between Google Home and Android will begin to blur. Google Home sales will continue to rise and, with that, more home integration will follow. This will trickle over to Android until we begin to see the lines blur between mobility and the fully connected home. The rise of Google Home could also finally give birth to the connected home base...an Android powered dock to control all of our devices from one location. SEE: Google Wifi wireless router: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) 5: Android Auto and Google Home will finally integrate. With the continued rise of both Android Auto and Google Home, I believe we will finally see integration of the two. Imagine getting ready for work on a blustery winter morning and being able to say "Okay, Google Home, start my car!" At some point in 2017, we will see such seamless integration, and it will be welcomed with much ballyhoo. SEE: Getting started with Android Auto (CNET) 6: Samsung's reputation will improve with the release of quality devices. 2016 was a rough year for the once-dominant Samsung. With phones catching fire leading to a massive recall, it seemed the company was on a collision course with failure. I'm fairly certain 2017 will see the Samsung ship right itself with the release of a few quality (and decidedly not explosive) devices. The Galaxy 8 should be arriving in February and will likely (and finally) ditch the home button, integrating it into the screen. The device might also see some of the smallest bezels of any device on the market, with a greater than 90% screen-to-body ratio. The device will go a long way to salvage the mobile arm of Samsung and see consumers forgiving them for the debacle that was 2016. SEE: Samsung continues to add flagship specs to its Galaxy A line (ZDNet) 7: OnePlus 5 will be one of the hottest devices of 2017. I believe OnePlus will release one of the most desired devices of the year; they will skip the "4" moniker and go straight for OnePlus 5. The new device will take a drastically different approach to materials and use either glass or ceramic for the body to create something wholly unique. Not only will the device offer a unique look and feel, it will be powered by a top-tier chipset and will sell at a price point low enough to put one of the most powerful flagship devices into the hands of users everywhere. SEE: OnePlus 3 smartphone: The smart person's guide (TechRepublic) It's going to be an interesting year I think it's safe to say that 2017 will be Android's biggest year. With a combination of incredible hardware and software, as well as far-reaching integration, Android will dominate in ways no other mobile platform could dream of.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Kuri is a cute $700 robot that fills a void in your empty human soul Chris Smith BGR NewsJanuary 3, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share If you already own a voice assistant at home, then you already have a home droid. Only, Amazon Echo or Google Home do not move around the house with you. However, there are plenty of startups working on robots for your home, and Kuri is one of this year’s cute robotic debutants. It might not be as smart as Alexa or Google’s Assistant, but this one will follow you around the house to ensure it can always do your bidding. Don't Miss: This rumored Galaxy S8 feature would be like nothing you’ve ever seen on an iPhone Kuri was created by Bosch startup Mayfield Robotics, and its purpose — other than looking adorable — is to assist you with your home’s smart features. If you’re considering buying a robot, then it’s likely your home is on the smart side of town. Like one of Roomba’s smart vacuum cleaners, Kuri will map the entire house and remember its layout. It’ll also know when it’s time to dock itself to recharge its battery. However, this is no smart vacuum cleaner. So what’s so special about this particular robot? Kuri is a voice-controlled machine that’s supposed to entertain the user, in addition to controlling smart home gadgets. And it’ll remind Star Wars fans of the cute BB-8 droid they’ve seen in the movie. It might not be your own BB-8 or R2-D2, but Kuri will respond to its master just like they do. As Tech Crunch reports, Kuri uses lights, expressive eyes, and sounds to communicate. kuri-robot-2More So, while you’re going to use plain old words to control other aspects of your smart home via Kuri or play music, it won’t talk back — you’re probably going to need Alexa for that. This robot is meant to be a companion rather than a voice assistant. I did mention Star Wars before, but it should be noted that Kuri’s movement design was actually created by a longtime Pixar animator, so expect some Wall-E personality traits from this contraption. Other features tucked in the three-foot robot include four microphones, an HD camera behind one eye, and a range of sensors to prevent it from falling over or bumping into objects. Aside from voice, you’ll be able to control Kuri via iPhone and Android apps, and IFTTT integration. The robot will cost $699, but you can preorder it right now for $100 down with the balance due upon shipment. It’ll ship much later after CES 2017, however, so don’t expect it to arrive anytime soon — Kuri is supposed to launch at some point during the holiday season.

By Hope Reese | January 3, 2017, 12:44 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus On Tuesday at CES 2017, Fiat Chrysler debuted the Portal, a battery-electric concept car capable of semi-autonomy. Designed for millennials, the high-tech car is a sleeker version of the Pacifica minivan, and comes equipped with tech that enables V2V (vehicle-to-vehicle) and V2I (vehicle-to-infrastructure) communication. The Portal is powered by a a lithium-ion battery pack, rated at about 100 kilowatt-hours (kWh), and can run for more than 250 miles after a full charge. Chrysler is also embracing facial and voice recognition, which that can allow for more personalized driving experiences.

The 360-degree cameras used in Portal come from Samsung Electronics, and Panasonic Automotive provided other sensors. While Level 3 driving cedes most control to the car, it still requires an active driver who can regain control in certain situations. "It's a great vehicle to base a future of selling thousands of vehicles to fleets operating autonomous cars," said Michael Ramsey, autonomous vehicle expert at Gartner. "It also shows a potential pivot of FCA toward electric vehicles that it had been hesitant about earlier." SEE: Our autonomous future: How driverless cars will be the first robots we learn to trust This step is an important advance in Chrysler's move toward autonomous vehicles. In May 2016, Chrysler announced a partnership with Google, which had previously been working on developing its own autonomous car. It was Google's first direct collaboration with a carmaker, and signaled Chrysler's intention to develop autonomous vehicles using Google's technology. More recently, Chrysler partnered with Waymo, a spinoff of Google's self-driving project, promising to offer 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to the driverless tech company. "It has the expected features of a concept vehicle—vehicular communication, autonomous operation, voice recognition. I like the idea of it being upgradeable to be able to add other features to it," said Jeffrey Miller, IEEE member and associate professor of engineering at the University of Southern California. "Chrysler is showing that they are going to be a player in the autonomous vehicle market even though they aren't an early adopter." The automaker defies labels for the 6-seater, declining to call it a minivan, SUV or crossover—instead, it calls it a "next-generation vehicle." But while the car has an impressive look, it's hard to say what it will really be capable of. Bryant Walker Smith, leading expert on the legal aspects of autonomous driving, put it this way: "I'd think a concept car —a vision with no certain prospect of actual realization—might aspire to Level 4."

Aristotle is a voice-assistant speaker made specifically for kids. At first glance Aristotle bears considerable resemblance to one of its adult contemporaries, Google Home, with its tube-like design and colored base. And much like the Amazon Echo and Google Home, the speaker houses an artificial intelligence called Aristotle that can answer the many questions that cross the mind of an inquisitive child. Powering the device's ability to field questions from kids is Microsoft, which lends its search tool Bing and AI from Cortana, its voice assistant that is often given a lower billing on the marquee than competitors like Alexa from Amazon, Apple's Siri and Google Assistant.  Aristotle is made with kids in mind, so it offers functionality that serves to interact with kids in unique ways. The AI can read them a bed time story, or play simple call-and-response style games that engage the child. The device is also compatible with Alexa, allowing parents to ask the standard queries they might serve up to an Amazon Echo by prompting it with Alexa's name rather than Aristotle. Alexa is active when Aristotle is set to parent mode, but disabled for kids when the device is in "child mode" to prevent issues like the viral video that took off recently showing a child's prompt for Alexa producing pornographic results. Bolstering the function of Aristotle is an additional bit of connectivity not found in other voice-controlled speakers: it comes with a camera, which turns it into a high-tech child monitor.  At least, that's the added benefit for parents. For kids, the camera won't be recognized so much as a way for adults to keep an eye on them and rather as another way to interact with Aristotle and their other favorite toys. The camera's computer vision gives it the ability to identify objects—a flashcard for instance—or add new functionality like providing a voice for an otherwise lifeless doll. With all the promise of connectivity comes just as many concerns, primarily with privacy. Earlier this year, manufacturers of smart toys came under fire for using the recorded voices of children users to fine-tune its voice recognition software—often without the consent of the children or their parents. Related Stories Lenovo Smart Assistant vs. Amazon Echo LG Unveiling Amazon Echo Competitor Hub Robot At CES 2017 Mattel is promising a more secure approach to Aristotle, offering an encrypted cloud connection to stream video and audio from the device to a parent's phone and 256-bit encryption on all transmissions to Aristotle's servers. Mattel will also handle the data in a way that is compliant with the Council of Parent Attorneys and Advocates (COPAA) and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), according to a report from Fast Company. It's less clear just how safe Mattel will be able to keep the data accessed by third parties, as the company is inviting developers to create apps and toys that will be compatible with its child-friendly, voice-controlled speaker. IBTimes reached out to Mattel for additional information but the company had not responded at the time of publication. Aristotle won't hit shelves until June, and will come with a $300 price tag when it is made available—nearly double the cost of the Amazon Echo and more than double the price of Google Home. Its smart monitoring features may prove itself worth the extra expenses. Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

While we can't measure the accuracy of each of the stories that we're hearing, there's enough chatter for us to believe that where there's smoke, there's real fire.  A SoundCloud purchase would certainly end Google's also ran status in music streaming. A deal for Spotify to buy SoundCloud for an estimated $1 billion fell through late last year, after Spotify decided that becoming an even bigger and more unprofitable company did not help its chances of having a successful IPO. Meanwhile, after rebuffing an offer from Liberty Media's SiriusXM, Pandora's investment bankers are reportedly sniffing around for another buyer who would best what is on the table. They're also hoping that the early 2017 launch of Pandora's Spotify competitor will increase company value. Alongside the inevitable consolidation coming in streaming and music tech, and some scrappy startups ready to make waves, 2017 is already shaping up to be quite a year.

Jordan Chittley The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Jan. 03, 2017 3:41PM EST Last updated Wednesday, Jan. 04, 2017 8:53AM EST Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article The Honda Civic, recently redesigned and re-launched as a hatchback, was the most searched car on Google in 2016. “It has been a best-selling car, or one of, for years, and is creating buzz and excitement in the market again,” said Deepak Anand, head of industry, auto, for Google Canada, in an e-mail. The Civic has been Canada’s best-selling car for 19 straight years. “When you have a popular car with lot of interest for future sales, you do very well in search growth.” Review: 2017 Honda Civic hatchback is the most useful Civic yet, but comes at a premium The list of most-searched vehicles is often reflected by the top-selling vehicles and by those that see a large growth in sales, said Anand. And this rings mostly true in 2016. The Ford Mustang (7,300 sold through November 2016) and Honda CR-V (41,700 sold through November 2016) round out the top three. Canada’s best-selling vehicle, the Ford F-150 (135,000 sold through November 2016), was fourth. The Mustang, at No. 2, was an exception. However, it underwent a redesign in 2015 and was the most searched car that year. Another exception would be the Range Rover, which was No. 7 on the list. “This would be the biggest surprise of the list this year,” said Anand. “Nearly every other vehicle is No. 1, 2 or 3 in its category or segment. The Range Rover is definitely up and coming, but doesn’t have the dominant sales to match its spot.” In 2015, the BMW 3 Series cracked the top 15, a rare feat for a luxury car. But Anand said searches are increasing for luxury brands and customers are spending more on cars. Google also monitors the most-asked questions in car-related categories. The most-asked questions in the electric car and hybrid car category were “How long does it take to charge an electric car?” and “What is a hybrid car?” “This is a pretty standard trend we see,” said Anand. “People start off with the thought of (buying an) electric or hybrid and, at some point, discover a better option for various reasons such as price, hybrid mileage isn’t as good as expected, or their home won’t support charging.” A study by Altman Vilandrie & Co. says about 60 per cent of U.S. drivers polled didn’t know a car can be plugged in and 80 per cent have never ridden in one. But the study also finds that a good chunk of people who have been in an EV liked the experience. While hybrid, plug-in hybrid and fully electric vehicles make up a small fraction of new cars sold in Canada, sales are increasing. More people are learning about green car because more are on the road and new options are available to consumers. BMW began offering plug-in versions of its 3-Series and X5 in 2016 and now has the most plug-in options of any retailer. This trend will continue in 2017 with a number of affordable, average-priced plug-in vehicles coming to Canada – including the Chevrolet Bolt, Volkswagen e-Golf and Tesla Model 3. Searches for green vehicles are up 20 per cent from 2015 and half of Canadian buyers say they would consider a hybrid or electric vehicles for their next purchase. “Given new laws, and entrants to the field, in addition to searches, we anticipate seeing hybrid sales increase, but not dramatically,” says Anand.

This year marks the 50th anniversary of CES and through it, we’ve seen technology like the first video cassette recorder, CD player, and game consoles unveiled to the public. Major Companies Appearing This Year Casio BMW Bosch Honor HTC Huawei Intel Faraday Future LG Lenovo Nissan Nvidia Panasonic Samsung Sony Qualcomm Toyota Volkswagen Xiaomi You’ll notice that both Google and Apple are missing from that list. Google holds its own event with Google I/O and Apple has WWDC where it reveals plenty of new tech, so don’t expect any gadgets from those two powerhouses. Microsoft has followed suit as CES 2012 was its last big show. What to Expect While CES is a huge show that’s focused on consumer tech, don’t expect to see huge phone announcements at this event. That’s usually reserved for Mobile World Congress in February. That doesn’t mean that there won’t be any mobile news at the show this week, though. We’re expecting to see some big names launch new phones at the show this year, including the new TCL-produced BlackBerry that has been rumored for so long. Rumors suggest the phone will feature a QWERTY keyboard and will be called the BlackBerry Mercury. Xiaomi is making its first debut at CES this year with the global launch of a brand new product. Xiaomi has been a big hit in markets like China and India, but now that saturation has taken over in those regions, the Chinese manufacturer is looking to expand its catalog of devices to other locations and this year’s CES is the springboard for that global expansion. The Huawei CEO will be delivering a keynote on January 5th that unveils the company’s new mobile strategy, which centers around three key points. Artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and connected technologies will be the key talking points, but other companies are expected to hop on the artificial intelligence bandwagon at this year’s show. ASUS is expected to unveil the second Tango-enabled device at this year’s show, bringing a new look at how smartphones and augmented reality technology can serve us in the future. We don’t know much about this device, other than rumors that suggest it could be powered by a Snapdragon 835. Android Wear suffered in 2016, as Google pushed back Android Wear 2.0 until this year. We expect manufacturers will take advantage of this new refresh of the Android Wear platform to introduce some interesting wearable tech that will integrate new services like Android Pay and Google Assistant. Expect these big companies to make small announcements to clear the way for Mobile World Congress next month, which means new updates for old phones and mid-range line-up refreshes to pave way for the next big flagship devices.

Video Mingis on Tech: New year, new CES -- and new AirPods We’ve all heard the hype about driverless cars, but where are they? Why aren’t we seeing them everywhere? To hear Google (whose self-driving car project is now called Waymo) explain it, self-driving cars are already a reality, and they should have been populating our streets and revolutionizing our travel years ago. In fact, earlier this year, Google hit a major milestone, with over 2 million miles driven by its 60 driverless vehicles in 4 states. There haven’t been any at-fault accidents caused by these vehicles, and the project continues to be refined, so what’s stopping us from buying these things and putting an end to the era of human error on the roads? There are a host of legal problems associated with driverless cars that I won’t get into -- lawmakers are slow to act and driverless cars are new types of complicated entities, but that’s still only one portion of the problem. Instead, I want to focus on the complicated artificial intelligence (A.I.) issues keeping Google from trying harder to get its cars in the hands of consumers. Despite the appearance of smooth running, there are still some major A.I. hurdles to overcome. 1. Moral decisions First, driverless car A.I. needs to address some moral ambiguities. Consider the trolley problem, as described by The Washington Post: “Imagine a trolley hurtling toward a cluster of five people who are standing on the track and facing certain death. By throwing a switch, an observer can divert the trolley to a different track where one person is standing, currently out of harm’s way but certain to die because of the observer’s actions.” If a driverless car could avert the death of several people by running into a wall and killing its own driver, should it? What if there’s an unavoidable accident, but the driverless car has the option of running into a heavy, safe vehicle or a smaller, unsafe vehicle -- which should it choose? Should it prioritize other driverless cars? How should it make these decisions? These moral ambiguities are further explored by Patrick Lin, but the basic problem is this: How can A.I. make moral decisions for driverless cars, and how should those decisions be coded? 2. Weather conditions Self-driving cars “see” the world much in the same way that you or I do -- they use cameras to detect things like traffic lights and lane markers. So what happens when there’s two inches of snow on the ground? What if it’s foggy? Currently, driverless cars haven’t been extensively tested in these conditions, and there’s no universal direction for how to solve this algorithmic problem. First, these vehicles need to be able to detect these highly variable, sometimes unpredictable decisions, and then they need to come up with a way to work around them. The problem is made even more complicated by overlapping conditions, such as fog with snow and hail. 3. Dark spots Cameras aren’t the only ways self-driving cars see the world, though. They also use radar and lasers to scan for obstacles. However, as New York Times writer Neal E. Boudette notes, vehicles currently have a hard time distinguishing between potholes, puddles, oil patches, and even shadows -- basically, any dark spot in the road could be interpreted as one of many different things, all of which require a different approach. Trying to code an algorithm to proactively analyze a feature like this requires some kind of new detection technology in combination with a fast-working and highly accurate decision tree for a possible response. 4. Improvisation Google cars currently use maps that are far more detailed and sophisticated than what’s publicly available in Google Maps -- they need to know everything about their environments, including traffic signs and other laws, if they’re going to function and remain intact. So what happens when a city closes a road due to intense flooding? What happens when construction shuts down a busy intersection? What if a new traffic sign is put up before the onboard maps have a chance to update? A.I. in driverless cars need to be prepared for literally anything; responses for ideal conditions are basically perfected, but unknown conditions require far more sophisticated programming. When can we expect these A.I. problems to be addressed and have driverless cars hit the streets? It’s tough to say. The scope of these problems, to anyone versed in the complexity of A.I. technology, is massive, and most A.I. coding issues require intuitive breakthroughs to solve completely. We’ll likely see random bursts of forward progress as problem solvers come up with ingenious solutions, rather than steady improvements over time. Based on that, it seems like we’re many years away from a finished product. But on the other hand, technology almost always develops faster than we expect. We could even see the first commercial driverless cars emerging in the next year or two -- if programmers can address these A.I. hurdles.

Advertisement For several months now, Google Nexus smartphone and tablet users have been using the company’s latest Android operating system. Android N, now called Android Nougat, is available right now for select Nexus/Pixel smartphones, Nexus tablets, and select phones from Android manufacturers. Samsung Galaxy smartphone and tablet owners should be keeping tabs on Samsung’s progress as we push into 2017. Why? Simple. The Samsung Galaxy Nougat release has begun for some of the company’s devices and we expect the roll out to pick up steam as we push deeper into 2017. Advertisement Today we want to take a look at everything we know so far about Samsung’s plans for its Galaxy smartphone and tablet owners.  This roundup is going to walk you through the important details about Samsung’s Galaxy Android Nougat updates and the Samsung Galaxy Nougat release. Samsung still isn’t saying all that much about its Android Nougat release but this roundup includes information about the Galaxy S7 Nougat update, the Galaxy S6 update, the Galaxy Note 5 update, the Galaxy Note 4 update, and more. We’ll continue to update this as we, and others, receive more information about Samsung’s plans for Android Nougat. Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat Update Let’s start with what we know about the Android Nougat update itself. Advertisement Samsung’s Nougat beta and the final release have confirmed a number of features coming to Galaxy devices. Each Galaxy Nougat update (updates for older devices typically aren’t as robust and carriers typically tack on their own changes) will be a bit different though we expect the core group of features to be the same across the board. If you’re unfamiliar with the Android Nougat update’s features, take a look at our walkthrough and comparison versus the Android Marshmallow update. You’ll also want to take a look at Samsung’s own Android Nougat guide. The consumer guide outlines the differences between Android Nougat and Marshmallow. The guide outlines the changes in great detail and will help you prepare for the changes coming with Samsung’s upcoming upgrade for your device. Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat Update Unlike previous versions of Samsung Android updates, Android Nougat on Galaxy devices looks a lot like Google’s version of Android. The videos here are from the beta but they’ll give you a feel for the changes on board the official version of Nougat. Samsung’s official version of Nougat for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge is currently based on Android 7.0, not Android 7.1.1. You’ll quickly notice slight changes to the UI’s color scheme. You can get a feel for these changes in the video above. You’ll also notice some changes to the Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge camera interface. The changes are similar to those found on the Samsung Galaxy Note 7’s version of Android. An update to the official Samsung Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge guides now goes into detail about many of the changes coming with Samsung’s Android Nougat update. The guide for the Galaxy S7 Edge, which can be found here in English, will talk you through the official version of the Nougat update. Here are a few of the highlights: App folders are now transparent. Samsung Pass: you no longer have to remember passwords. Device Maintenance: helps you optimize battery, performance, and security. A Device Maintenance panel for the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. New calendar interface. Improved battery usage meter. You can now sleep apps to save battery life. Video Enhancer tool: improves audio and video quality. Again, these are Galaxy S7 Nougat features and we expect each Nougat update from Samsung to be a bit different. Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat Release Date Samsung’s Nougat roll out date for Galaxy smartphones and tablets is finally here for the select people with select devices. Early rumors and reports suggested that Samsung’s first Galaxy Android Nougat updates would roll out in Q4 of 2016. Q4 includes October, November and December. Those rumors were off-base. Instead, most carriers are preparing to roll out their Nougat updates in in 2017. Samsung Galaxy S7 Nougat Release Here are a few things we know about the Samsung Galaxy Nougat S7 release date: A stable Android 7.0 Nougat build is rolling out to the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge though the roll out appears to be limited to beta testers. The update is 215MB for the Galaxy S7. A report claims the Galaxy S7 Nougat update will start rolling out in Europe on January 17th. This could be the date it rolls out to non-beta testers. Galaxy smartphone carriers are also starting to chime in with their own information about the Galaxy Android Nougat release date. Australia carrier, Vodafone Australia, has confirmed plans to release Samsung Android Nougat updates in the future. Vodafone’s confirmed Nougat updates for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge though it says that issues were found during testing and that it’s “awaiting new software from Samsung.” Vodafone Australia isn’t the only carrier talking about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy Android Nougat release. In an announcement to its Android 7.0 Nougat beta testers, Verizon confirmed its Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge Nougat update releases for 2017. Here is the statement it sent out to beta testers: Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team While a specific release date remains unclear, Android Nougat powered Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge models recently received Wi-Fi certifications, a sign that a widespread release is indeed inching closer. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Active Android Nougat has also appeared in benchmarks which means Samsung is likely testing the software behind the scenes. The Samsung Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Samsung Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge Plus, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 edge, and Samsung Galaxy Note 5 will reportedly be first in line to the Android Nougat update. Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, & More Australian carrier Optus says that it plans to release the Android Nougat for the Samsung Galaxy A5 later this month. The carrier doesn’t confirm a specific roll out date. The carrier is currently testing the software which means there’s no guarantee it will arrive in January. Android updates are often delayed due to the testing process. Samsung’s reportedly started development on the Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge Android Nougat updates with a release expected later this year. The updates are expected to include a number of important changes. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Android 7.0 Nougat update recently surfaced in a GFXBench benchmark, a sign that the update is progressing behind the scenes. The company’s also rumored to have started development on the Galaxy Note 5 Android Nougat update and the Galaxy Tab S2 Android Nougat update. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Android 7.0 Nougat update recently was spotted in a benchmark. Same goes for the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 Nougat update, the Galaxy A5 update, and the Galaxy A3 Nougat update. All three have shown up in benchmarks which means they are likely in testing in Samsung’s labs. The Samsung Galaxy J3 Android Nougat update just appeared in a Wi-Fi certification, a sign that it’s in development behind the scenes. In addition, the company is also reportedly working on Android Nougat updates for the Samsung Galaxy A7, Galaxy A8, Galaxy A9, and the Samsung Galaxy A9 Pro Nougat updates. Look for these updates to start pushing out in early-to-mid 2017, sometime after Samsung gets Nougat out to its flagship models. In the United States, T-Mobile’s confirmed Nougat updates for the Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. All of these updates are currently in the “Manufacturer Development” which means they still have a long way to go before they are released to the public. All of them will go through internal testing at T-Mobile before they are released to the public. They are likely still weeks away from touching down. Other vocal North American carriers, like Canadian provider Telus, remain silent about their plans for Android Nougat. Android 7.1.1 Nougat Google’s Android 7.1 Nougat update is now available for select Nexus devices around the world. As expected, it’s packed with new features and bug fixes for lingering Nougat problems. Samsung hasn’t confirmed anything yet but it looks like it will base its Android Nougat updates, at least the initial ones, on Android 7.0. This is a bit odd given that a recent soak test hinted at the release of of Android 7.1.1. The next three quarterly maintenance releases of Android Nougat will be Android 7.1 / 7.1.1 / 7.1.2 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2016 The Samsung Galaxy S7 Android Nougat update that’s rolling out right now is based on Android 7.0, not Android 7.1.1. We could see a shift to Android 7.1.1 down the road but for now it looks like the update is based on the previous version. For more on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, take a look at our walkthrough. It compares Android 7.1.1 to Android 7.0 and Android Marshmallow. Samsung January Security Update The initial batch of Samsung Galaxy Nougat updates will roll out with Samsung’s January security update on board. The company recently posted the patch notes to its website and the patch comes with several key patches for known exploits. For more on the January security patch, take a look at Samsung’s website. It outlines all of the patches in great detail. 10 Things to Do Before Installing Samsung Galaxy Marshmallow Get Familiar with Android 6.0.1 & Marshmallow   1 / 10 Let's start with something very important.  One of the first things you'll want to do is get familiar with the changes coming with your version of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. Each update is going to be a little bit different (carriers can't help themselves) but there some core elements to each.  There are a number of resources around the web but we'll provide you with some great starting points right here.  We've taken a deep dive into the differences between Lollipop and Marshmallow and you'll want to check the basics out so that you're comfortable with the changes.  Android 6.0.1, the version of Marshmallow rolling out to Galaxy devices, is a little different than Android 6.0. You can get familiar with some of Android 6.0.1's basics right here. And then we get to the device level. That is to say that the Galaxy S6 Marshmallow update is a little different than the Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow update. We've outlined some of those differences and you can find them at the links provided.  Things will be different at the carrier level as well and you'll want to look into those changes as well. Unfortunately, those changes will arrive whenever Samsung and your carrier decide to push out Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow for your device. We'll provide you with the Verizon Galaxy Note 5 Marshmallow release notes as an example.  If you haven't been following along, now is a great time to look into the new features and enhancements so that you're as proficient as possible after you download and install Marshmallow on your Galaxy phone or tablet.    1 / 10 27 Responses 08/15/2016 liviaemily_6 Reply I am using s6edge plus I think that samsung should give Marshalltow on it please 08/25/2016 William Bogardus Reply Didn’t someone say that the Note 7 would be released within Android 7.0 upgrade? seems like no one’s telling the truth.

According to some Galaxy Note Edge owners, it also brings battery life problems along with it. With that in mind, we want to take an in-depth look at how to potentially fix bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life before and after Android 5.0 Lollipop. In September, Samsung took the curtain down from around its Galaxy Note Edge. As expected, the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge debuted with all sorts of bells and whistles including a new design, an improved display, a solid camera, and Android 4.4.4 KitKat. At the time, Android 4.4.4 KitKat was the most current version of Google’s mobile operating system. Given the Galaxy Note Edge’s status as a flagship, it was no surprise that it was among the first Samsung Galaxy smartphones to get Google’s new mobile OS, Android 5.0 Lollipop. The Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update started rolling earlier this year and it delivers some big time features to Galaxy Note Edge users. Some have already gotten a taste of the changes, others are still waiting for the update to start rolling out. While the Galaxy Note Edge Lollipop update brings some huge changes to the device, it also brings Android 5.0 Lollipop problems including the usual array of battery life issues. Complaints about bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life have started to pick up as the software’s moved out to more variants and more regions around the world including the United States. Battery life issues always seem to plague Galaxy users after a new Android update though most of the time it’s not the actual update that’s causing the problems. Apps and other services are usually the culprit. For the moment, these Galaxy Note Edge battery life problems appear to be somewhat isolated though we do expect them to grow as more updates roll out. How to Fix Bad Galaxy Note Edge Battery Life With that in mind, we want to try and fix bad Samsung Galaxy Note Edge battery life for you. This guide delivers help to get better battery life on Samsung’s current flagship. These fixes should work if you’re on Android 4.4 KitKat or if you’re on Android 5.0 Lollipop. We’ve geared this towards Android 5.0 Lollipop users but we know that plenty of people remain on the older version of Google’s software. Find Apps Eating Up Your Battery The first recommendation we always make to people suffering from bad battery life is to check out third-party applications before doing anything else. Some people listen, some don’t. If you want to fix your bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life, you’re going to want to keep an eye on your applications for potential problems. Third-party apps have a tendency to put a huge dent into the battery life on smartphones regardless of the software that’s running on board. If you use an application a lot, it’s going to drain your battery but there are also times where bugs or issues might cause an app to go rogue and start abnormally draining the device’s charge. The first thing you’ll want to do is head into your settings and start taking a look at the effect that Galaxy Note Edge applications are having on the device’s battery life. If you notice anything out of the ordinary, it’s time to dig in. If you think an app is draining more battery life than it should be, try reinstalling it to see if that corrects the issue. If the problem persists, try uninstalling it to see if that has a positive effect. If you can’t figure out which app might be causing trouble, you’ll want to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode in an effort to single out potential troublemakers. Booting the device into Safe Mode disables third-party apps and allows you to isolate apps that could be causing the problems. Here’s how to boot the Galaxy Note Edge into Safe Mode: Power down the device. Then, press & hold the Power button and volume down key. Once it boots up, you can let go of the power button but keep the volume key held down. When you have successfully entered into Safe Mode, you will notice the text ‘Safe Mode’ at the bottom left corner of the screen. Restart the Galaxy Note Edge If you start noticing weird battery drain and or your Galaxy Note Edge starts heating up, you should try performing a simple restart to see if that returns things to normal. Most of you know how to restart the Galaxy Note Edge but we’ll remind you anyway. Hold down the power button, confirm that you want to turn it off, and then hold the power button down to turn it back on. We recommend doing this a few times a month to flush your device’s cache. Disable Unnecessary Services If your apps aren’t the problem and a simple restart doesn’t work, it’s time to start fiddling with some settings and working on some of your daily habits. In our experience, disabling features when they aren’t in use tends to have a positive impact on overall battery life. We recommend shutting off Wi-Fi connectivity when you don’t need it, Bluetooth connectivity when you don’t need it, NFC when you don’t need it, GPS when you don’t need it, and cellular data when you don’t need it. You can turn all of those off from inside the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge’s settings and you can easily monitor them with a quick swipe down from the top of the device’s screen. One thing that we’ve noticed is that poor cellular coverage is often to blame for bad Android battery life. When your Galaxy Note Edge needs to search hard for a signal, it runs the battery down faster, so keep that in mind when you’re in spotty areas. You may need to turn on Airplane Mode when there isn’t a strong 4G or LTE signal in the area. Try Using a Black Wallpaper Switching to a black wallpaper could help deliver better Galaxy Note Edge battery life thanks to the way Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays consume power. The device does not come with a default black wallpaper but you can search online for one. There are tons of them out there. After you’ve downloaded one, go to Settings, Wallpaper, Home and Lock Screens, More Images, and then set your black Galaxy Note Edge wallpaper. It’s a quick fix but there’s a chance that it will help. Start Using Its Built-in Software Features The Samsung Galaxy Note Edge comes equipped with two software features that you should know about if you’re experiencing bad battery life or if you’re concerned about the potential for bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If you head into the device’s Settings, you’ll notice two features. One is called Power Saving mode. The other is called Ultra Power Saving Mode. These features allow you to block background data and turn on grayscale mode which can help to limit the amount of juice being sucked up. You can also slow down the processor, reduce screen performance, turn off the lights on the buttons, and turn off GPS to save battery life. We also recommend getting familiar with the the Galaxy Note Edge’s brightness slider. The Galaxy Note Edge’s powerful display can suck up battery life so you’ll want to monitor the brightness of the screen if you’re starting to notice bad Galaxy Note Edge battery life. If auto-brightness isn’t working out, try doing it manually. Replace the Stock Launcher You also might want to consider replacing the stock TouchWiz launcher on the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge with something new. Samsung’s TouchWiz launcher has been known to hinder performance and it can be replaced. There are tons of different launches to choose from though the Nova Launcher is one of Android’s most popular choices. Give that a try if these other simple fixes don’t work out. Downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat If you’ve already moved to Android 5.0 Lollipop, and some of you have, note that you can return to Android 4.4 KitKat in the event that Android 5.0 isn’t to your liking. We recently put together a guide on how to accomplish this so that’s going to be a great starting point for those of you that want to drop back down to Android 4.4. Factory Reset the Galaxy Note Edge If you don’t want to downgrade to Android 4.4 KitKat and you can’t find any fixes for your battery problems, you can factory reset your Galaxy Note Edge. This will wipe all of your files so you’ll need to make a backup before going this route. To factory reset the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge, go into Settings, User & Backup, and select Backup and Reset. From there, select Factory Data Reset. From there, select Reset Device and then Delete All. If nothing works, contact your carrier or Samsung. If you’re under warranty, you might be able to finagle your way into getting another device, or at the very least, a replacement battery. 6 Responses 05/20/2015 Jim Carter Reply The Lollipop update was certainly responsible for my battery/overheating issues as evidenced by flawless KitKat performance followed by immediate post update issues. There were no app additions, subtractions or updates. Upon seeing such stark evidence, I did a factory reset and all was well once again. Smartphones are no different than Windows PCs when it comes to OS updates. A clean install versus one OS on top of another is always the best choice. 05/26/2016 Carl Reply Soon tired of the remedies for fixing battery drain after an update.. If it wasn’t a problem before the update why should I have to go through all this crap of uninstalling all these apps BLACK WALLPAPER WTF? I didn’t buy this phone to make all kinds of changes these are not fixes but down grades on an expensive phone, this is useless info. 09/26/2016 Adam Reply I agree with Carl ^^^ 10/09/2016 Sergey Reply Usless article, misleading title. 10/29/2016 Deneiro Reply My phone is one year old, still making payments , went to Verizon , they told me to go buy a new battery, 30.00 dollars later I’m still pissed off 01/03/2017 Douglas Edwards Reply My Note Edge reboots when I still have 68% battery. A full charge with light to medium use last about 5 hours. I am considering tossing this and getting an IPhone. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Posted by Jim Boykin to Jim Boykin's Blog Tweet Share Share +1 Yesterday QualityGal gave a few thoughts on the recent comments about Michael Gray’s take on Guy Kawasaki accepting a camera for the review…and how they feel Google should treat this (the ole paid link debate stuff). It’s a debate that I’m personally happy to stay out of….though I know how Yahoo would try to treat this…..hey, the world will never be perfect…ya can’t always get what ya want…but if you try some times, you might just find…you can get what you need…oh yea!… But since QualityGal talked some on paid links yesterday (and I’ll try to stay out of that), maybe I can talk some of Google’s Quality Raters today (FYI, there may possibly be over 10,000 of them) – QualityGal can’t really comment; she’s a stickler about her NDA. Today I saw that Barry Schwartz had noted a post by Scott Huffman on the Google Blog on how Human Reviewers are used to help Google with their Algorithms. Now QualityGal may have a lot of experience rating web pages, but don’t think that she’s ever told me any Google secrets…..I had already given a few presentations at SEOClass on "What a Human Reviewer Might Look At" before ever hiring QualityGal. I know a lot of what the human reviewers might be looking at…I may have come across some documents online…I’ll plead the 5th on that… Anyways, there’s really no "hidden secrets" in any of these documents that I many or may not have read…there’s no "oh, here’s something one could exploit"….if anything, it shows that the human review is very very hard to "exploit"….you need to provided the searcher what they are seeking. I can narrow all the documents I may have ever read about the human reviewers down to this basic point. Serve the User’s Intent for the Phrase Searched. As Scott said on the Google Blog today, First, understanding what a user really wants when they type a query — the query’s "intent" — can be very difficult. For highly navigational queries like [ebay] or [orbitz], we can guess that most users want to navigate to the respective sites. But how about [olympics]? Does the user want news, medal counts from the recent Beijing games, the IOC’s homepage, historical information about the games, … ? This same exact question, of course, is faced by our ranking and search UI teams. Evaluation is the other side of that coin. In the old days at We Build Pages if a client said they wanted to target one specific page to rank great for "Widgets," "Green Widgets," and "Small Widgets," we might have said "sure" if we felt the traffic was good, felt we could achieve it, and felt they’d get their ROI. These days, we’d take our analysis one step further to ask "Does this page serve as a great page for the user intent for each of those phrases?" …and to take that a step further to ask, "How good is that page compared to the other pages in the top 10 for each phrases?" We’ve also brought QualityGal into several meetings with clients to help explain to them that it’s not the best thing to target a page that doesn’t match the user’s intent. We can change the page or the targeted page (and give ideas for solutions)…but we really want to match the user’s intent…it’s the best thing for everyone (the user, Google, the site…and the SEO). That may sound simple, but you’d be amazed at how many people only think of keyword popularity, or ROI, rankings, yada yada metrics…yet they leave out "user intent" in their analysis …and ranking #1 for that dream phrase isn’t utilized if it doesn’t match the users intent…and worse case, the human reviewers may collectively vote that you’re type of page isn’t they type that should be on the first page….that’d suck.   Related posts: (QualityGal) That page fails at meeting user intent. No, really. What if a Human Reviewer Looked at your Backlinks? (QualityGal) Keyword-Rich Domain Names and Sites That Don’t Suck QualityGal is hopping on the social networking bandwagon Short URL: https://www.internetmarketingninjas.com/blog/?p=473 Logging In...

Does the user want news, medal counts from the recent Beijing games, the IOCâ€™s homepage, historical information about the games, â€¦ ? Taking this thought. I heard Google say (In a video) that they have a problem with understanding when someone types in [dallas web design] because they don’t know if the users are looking for a company named ‘dallas web design’ or ‘web design’ in ‘dallas’. So they do various tests and move the domain name [dallas web design] around to see if it’s value to the users. Like if dallaswebdesign.com was #1 they throw it to #3 and wait to see if it still has a high CTR/low bounce rate. And other various tests. It amazes me the ‘secrets in their Algos’ that you can get from those vids. 😉 Go YouTube! 🙂 Yura View September 17, 2008 If you take into account conversions and sales, then your point of intent can be understood much easier. It is the same discussion about relevant, laser-targeted or untargeted traffic, too. In this case, it is more laser-targeted traffic, it seems, but I really don’t find it gamebreaking or smth. Am I missing anything? Thanks. Jim Boykin View September 17, 2008 Yura, you could be missing something….depends. for the phrases you’re targeting, do you deserve to be in the top 10? Is the PAGE that ranks a great resource (note I said PAGE, not site…everything with the raters is Page Based…not Site Based). It not enough to have relevant traffic…to stay in the top 10 you have to be a cut above everyone else on your PAGE. QualityGal View September 18, 2008 I do believe you just outed me, boss. 😉 Jim Boykin View September 18, 2008 opps….yea….but no one knows your real name yet 😉 Right Lucy? QualityGal View September 19, 2008 LOL. There’s that, at least! Blondie/Pam View September 19, 2008 I just had to come and find out who outed you. LOL Like This Post? Please Share!

(Reuters/Alexandre Meneghini) Share Written by Jon Evans Principal software engineer, HappyFunCorp January 03, 2017 Technology concentrates power. The great Maciej Ceglowski warned us of this three years ago, in his epic talk/essay Our Comrade the Electron. But this year, more than ever, we learned how true this concept really is. Paradoxically, as more and more people reap the benefits of modern technology, the wealth and power it generates accrues to fewer and fewer companies. A tiny number of colossal corporations have extended their reach over the tech industry to the extent that they have a tentacle in, and enormous influence over, nearly every proverbial pot. In 2017, these tentacles are likely to continue to stifle broader, open-market innovation. The little guys are losing the battle for the internet—at least for now. Bruce Sterling, poet laureate of futurists, was also an early prophet when it comes to the uber centralization of the internet. In a 2012 essay in The Atlantic, he dubbed the five most dominant tech corporations—Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google (now Alphabet), and Microsoft—”the Stacks” because they are all five massive, vertically organized silos. Prognostications don’t get much better than this: earlier this year those became the five most valuable publicly traded companies on the planet. “Software is eating the world,” to quote Marc Andreessen’s famous dictum, and software is increasingly a winner-takes-all business. The overwhelming majority of smartphones in use today run one of two operating systems, both built by a Stack company. One Stack dominates social networking. Another dominates search. Three of them—Amazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft—dominate cloud computing, i.e. the hardware and infrastructure on which tomorrow’s world-eating software will run. It is widely agreed that AI is the next big thing in software. The Stacks are already buying all of the best AI startups, and, more importantly, have an overwhelming AI advantage over non-Stacks. To be effective, AI software needs data, the more the better, and the Stacks have all the best data. As a result, more and more, startups—and not just AI startups—are built not to dominate the sphere in which they operate, but in hopes of being acquired by a Stack. There was a period of several years, as smartphones metastasized and conquered the world, when anybody could build an app and be successful. A good example of this is Uber, founded in 2009, and now the third-largest private employer in the world. But the smartphone boom may be slowing. App stores are stuffed full of millions of apps that nobody downloads. Think of Y Combinator, the Harvard of startups, which was founded in 2006. In 2011, after five years of operations, its poster children were Airbnb, Dropbox, and Stripe. It was already apparent that all three had every opportunity to become major new forces, and all three did. In the five years since, Y Combinator has fostered far more startups than it did in its first five years. Not one of them seems as well-positioned today as those famous three were five years ago. Technology has concentrated power—mostly in the Stacks—and startups are suffering for it. Most of us think of these developments as perfectly normal. But we should be concerned about centralized power, especially with the rise of autocratic governments around the world. We should minimize the ways that this power can be used against people. At the very least, we should insist that companies not be permitted to collect our data unless that data is necessary for the basic operations of a given service; that our data is encrypted when it is collected; and that it is deleted upon request or when it is no longer being used. It may also be time for some more drastic changes to the way the tech world works. (Not least because “anonymized” data often isn’t actually anonymized.) Perhaps, for instance, laws should be changed so that individuals legally own all of their data, regardless of who collected it or how, and can control how it can be used and when it is discarded. As we head into 2017, however, there is some reason for hope—although not for the immediate future. Historically, the technological pendulum has swung back and forth between centralized and decentralized computing. “Big iron” mainframes evolved into personal computers. “Walled gardens” like AOL and CompuServer evolved into the open Internet. “The Stacks” may themselves give way to something else, although what that next iteration might look like is unclear. “Personal cloud platform” Sandstorm, perhaps? Blockchains? We’ll see. But I predict that, even as the mighty T. Rexes of the Stacks stalk the earth, devouring smaller, plant-eating startups, we will see the early mammals of decentralized technology begin to grow and spread. At first these species will live side by side, peacefully untroubled by one another. And then, some years from now, these mammals will begin to run rings around the Stacks.

For those who haven't seen the Echo (or got a Google Home instead), it is a round tall black cylinder about a foot plus high, containing seven or so microphones plus a beautiful set of speakers.  Echo is always-on, always listening for voice commands triggered by the keyword "Alexa" to invoke recording and processing.   (Note to Google - "OK Google" as a voice assistant trigger is: 1) One word too many and 2) You didn't really get it why Amazon and Apple named their assistants differently from their services, right?) It is fair to say everyone has only begun to scratch the surface of a virtual assistant through a dedicated appliance (i.e. Echo and the lower-cost Dot).  Amazon provides API hooks so third-party services from pizza delivery to Lyft and Uber ride shares can be ordered via voice, but it is going to take time and education – (Thank you Amazon, for the daily TV reminders!) – for people to truly understand and get the most out of a virtual assistant. There are three things I'd like Alexa to do in the future. First, I'd love for it to have unique user profiles keyed to voice identification/voice biometrics. If you can order goods and services through Echo via voice, there will be a need and demand for better security beyond “The order came through your device.”  At some point this will happen, probably the day after the news story where an eight year old goes wild buying video games and toys with his voice using Amazon Prime while the parents were in a different room or sleeping in.  Voice biometrics provide authentication and the ability to create user profiles.  Amazon is already probably working on this feature, as it will give more granular details on consumer behavior, which it can leverage to sell more things.  It wouldn't shock me if Alexa is already keeping a background count as to how many different users access it through an Echo and for how long each day. Once Alexa can figure out who is speaking, I want to see it move into the business arena to ride shotgun with me – an area where Google might have an upper hand.  Going through my cloud-based email, it would be nice to say things like, "Alexa, please schedule this meeting."  Yes, I know there are all kinds of ways you can do this already through Google-based assistants and voice recognition and my phone, but if I'm sitting at my desk and Alexa is already "listening" and playing music in the background, why can't I get it to do a bit more work for me? Key applications in the work environment would include hands-free operation during presentations – “Alexa, next slide please,” – and anywhere else where a voice-interface would make sense in the trinity of business applications.  Microsoft's Cortana already has a leg up with its integration into Windows 10, so I suspect we will see a Microsoft Surface Cortana gizmo down the road, with an LED screen and projector built in.  An actual image of Cortana could appear, pictures and videos could be displayed as part of the assistant's functions, and so on. "Telephony" would be the final integration I'd like to see, but that gets into the hybrid oddness we have today between traditional-ish SMS text messaging, voice telephony, and Voice over IP (VoIP) and IP-based messaging.  Still, it would be nice to say "Alexa" (Or "Cortana") "Please call Jeff Rodman" and simply have the call happen. Again, I know I can do this by pulling out my cell phone and saying "OK Google, call Jeff Rodman," assuming I have programmed Jeff's phone number into my contact list, but we don't have the quality of ease of use we should have. If you had to pick a loser out of the AI assistant race, Apple is probably it.  It had the opportunity to open up Siri to third-party developers relatively early, but didn't.  Meanwhile, Siri's developers built a better Siri emphasizing APIs and a third-party ecosystem, while being bought by Samsung shortly after unveiling.  Amazon can use Alexa and Echo to collect more consumer data and sell more things; meanwhile, Microsoft has Cortana embedded across its platforms and is no doubt building deeper hooks between Cortana and cloud and business applications.  Meanwhile, Google Home can tap into a larger ecosystem and knowledge base than Echo currently, but like all things Google, there are a lot of rough edges in how things work together.  If Google could combine its product builds with a health seasoning of Apple's (former) "get it right" product polishing, it would have a category winner.

Google Wants to Help by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on January 3, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Google has released a guide to its cloud platform written specifically for data center professionals with minimal cloud experience. Like its competitors Amazon and Microsoft, Google is coveting the enterprise cloud market, wanting companies housing IT infrastructure in their own or colocation data centers to migrate as many workloads as possible from those facilities onto its cloud platform. The guide is meant to explain to the people running enterprise data centers how the cloud substitutes each function of the facilities they operate. “Google Cloud Platform for Data Center Professionals is a guide for customers who are looking to move to Google Cloud Platform and are coming from non-cloud environments,” Peter-Mark Verwoerd, a Google solutions architect, wrote in a blog post. The guide covers the basics of running IT in the cloud: compute, networking, storage, and management. Starting in 2015, Google increased investment in its cloud services business and amplified messaging around it. The enterprise cloud opportunity is huge, but the company is far behind its biggest competitors in terms of market share. One analyst report last year estimated that the top Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud providers collectively made $11.2 billion in revenue in 2015 and forecasted the market’s size to reach $120 billion by 2020. Google’s share of the market in 2015 was 2.5 percent, compared to Amazon’s 70.7 percent and Microsoft’s 10.8 percent, according to Structure Research, which published the report. See also: Here’s Google’s Plan for Calming Enterprise Cloud Anxiety Google’s efforts to prove its cloud’s worth included hiring VMware founder Diane Greene to lead its cloud business, investing in 10 new data center locations, and calling attention to well-known cloud customers, including Spotify, Niantic (the company behind Pokémon Go), Coca-Cola, and The Walt Disney Company.

Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. Think bots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, site scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, bots that take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and more.

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

Davide Castelvecchi 03 January 2017 Article tools PDF Rights & Permissions Kai Hudek, Univ. Maryland A front runner in the pursuit of quantum computing uses single ions trapped in a vacuum. Quantum computing has long seemed like one of those technologies that are 20 years away, and always will be. But 2017 could be the year that the field sheds its research-only image. Computing giants Google and Microsoft recently hired a host of leading lights, and have set challenging goals for this year. Their ambition reflects a broader transition taking place at start-ups and academic research labs alike: to move from pure science towards engineering. “People are really building things,” says Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park who co-founded the start-up IonQ in 2015. “I’ve never seen anything like that. It’s no longer just research.” Google moves closer to a universal quantum computer Google started working on a form of quantum computing that harnesses superconductivity in 2014. It hopes this year, or shortly after, to perform a computation that is beyond even the most powerful ‘classical’ supercomputers — an elusive milestone known as quantum supremacy. Its rival, Microsoft, is betting on an intriguing but unproven concept, topological quantum computing, and hopes to perform a first demonstration of the technology. The quantum-computing start-up scene is also heating up. Monroe plans to begin hiring in earnest this year. Physicist Robert Schoelkopf at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who co-founded the start-up Quantum Circuits, and former IBM applied physicist Chad Rigetti, who set up Rigetti in Berkeley, California, say they expect to reach crucial technical milestones soon. Academic labs are at a similar point. “We have demonstrated all the components and all the functions we need,” says Schoelkopf, who continues to run a group racing to build a quantum computer at Yale. Although plenty of physics experiments still need to be done to get components to work together, the main challenges are now in engineering, he and other researchers say. The quantum computer with the most qubits so far — 20 — is being tested in an academic lab led by Rainer Blatt at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. Inside Microsoft’s quest for a topological quantum computer Whereas classical computers encode information as bits that can be in one of two states, 0 or 1, the ‘qubits’ that comprise quantum computers can be in ‘superpositions’ of both at once. This, together with qubits’ ability to share a quantum state called entanglement, should enable the computers to essentially perform many calculations at once. And the number of such calculations should, in principle, double for each additional qubit, leading to an exponential speed-up. This rapidity should allow quantum computers to perform certain tasks, such as searching large databases or factoring large numbers, which would be unfeasible for slower, classical computers. The machines could also be transformational as a research tool, performing quantum simulations that would enable chemists to understand reactions in unprecedented detail, or physicists to design materials that superconduct at room temperature. “I tell my students that 2017 is the year of braiding.” There are many competing proposals for how to build qubits. But there are two front runners, confirmed in their ability to store information for increasingly long times — despite the vulnerability of quantum states to external disturbance — and to perform quantum-logic operations. One approach, which Schoelkopf helped to pioneer and which Google, IBM, Rigetti and Quantum Circuits have adopted, involves encoding quantum states as oscillating currents in superconducting loops. The other, pursued by IonQ and several major academic labs, is to encode qubits in single ions held by electric and magnetic fields in vacuum traps. John Martinis, who worked at the University of California, Santa Barbara, until Google hired him and his research group in 2014, says that the maturity of superconducting tech­nologyprompted his team to set the bold goal of quantum supremacy. The team plans to achieve this using a ‘chaotic’ quantum algorithm that produces what looks like a random output (S. Boixo et al. Preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00263; 2016). If the algorithm is run on a quantum computer made of relatively few qubits, a classical machine can predict its output. But once the quantum machine gets close to about 50 qubits, even the largest classical supercomputers will fail to keep pace, the team predicts. Quantum computer makes first high-energy physics simulation The results of the calculation will not have any uses, but they will demonstrate that there are tasks at which quantum computers are unbeatable — an important psychological threshold that will attract the attention of potential customers, Martinis says. “We think it will be a seminal experiment.” But Schoelkopf does not see quantum supremacy as “a very interesting or useful goal”, in part because it dodges the challenge of error correction: the ability of the system to recover its information following slight disturbances to the qubits, which becomes more difficult as the number of qubits increases. Instead, Quantum Circuits is focused on making fully error-corrected machines from the start. This requires building in more qubits, but the machines could also run more-sophisticated quantum algorithms. Monroe hopes to reach quantum supremacy soon, but that is not IonQ’s main goal. The start-up aims to build machines that have 32 or even 64 qubits, and the ion-trap technology will enable their designs to be more flexible and scalable than superconducting circuits, he says. Microsoft, meanwhile, is betting on the technology that has the most to prove. Topological quantum computing depends on excitations of matter that encode infor­mation by tangling around each other like braids. Information stored in these qubits would be much more resistant to outside disturbance than are other technologies and would, in particular, make error correction easier. Sign up - it's free! No one has yet managed to create the state of matter needed for such excitations, let alone a topological qubit. But Microsoft has hired four leaders in the field, including Leo Kouwenhoven of the University of Delft in the Netherlands, who has created what seems to be the right type of excitation. “I tell my students that 2017 is the year of braiding,” says Kouwenhoven, who will now build a Microsoft lab on the Delft campus. Other researchers are more cautious. “I am not making any press releases about the future,” says Blatt. David Wineland, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, who leads a lab working on ion traps, is also unwilling to make specific predictions. “I’m optimistic in the long term,” he says, “but what ‘long term’ means, I don’t know.” Journal name: Nature Volume: 541, Pages: 9–10 Date published: (05 January 2017) DOI: doi:10.1038/541009a Tweet Follow @NatureNews Follow @dcastelvecchi Related stories and links From nature.com Inside Microsoft’s quest for a topological quantum computer 21 October 2016 Quantum computer makes first high-energy physics simulation 22 June 2016 Google moves closer to a universal quantum computer 08 June 2016 AI talent grab sparks excitement and concern 26 April 2016 Physics: Quantum computer quest 03 December 2014 Topological insulators: Star material 14 July 2010 From elsewhere IBM Research Quantum Experience Rigetti Quantum Circuits Author information Author details Davide Castelvecchi Davide joined Nature in December 2012.

The IoT market is rapidly growing, but security, privacy, and conflicting ecosystems will remain top concerns next year. Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Jan 3, 2017 at 1:36PM The Internet of Things (IoT), which links mobile devices, wearables, home automation devices, cars, and other gadgets to each other and the cloud, is frequently considered the next big growth market for hardware and software makers. Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) estimates that the number of connected devices worldwide will double from 25 billion in 2015 to 50 billion by 2020. Image source: Getty Images. That's why chipmakers like Intel and Qualcomm launched new low-power chips for IoT devices, and networking leaders like Cisco and Juniper Networks added IoT features to their networking hardware and software. Looking ahead into 2017, the battle over the IoT market will likely heat up as these companies expand their hardware and software ecosystems. Let's take a look at the four main trends investors should pay close attention to. Security concerns The Mirai botnet and its variants recently hijacked unsecured IoT devices -- like IP cameras and routers -- to take down major websites with DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks. Those attacks revealed that many IoT devices were poorly protected from a type of threat that was previously rendered obsolete on PC and mobile platforms. If additional attacks occur in 2017, many organizations and consumers could reconsider connecting everything to the Internet of Things. However, Cisco, Symantec (NASDAQ:SYMC), and other security giants are already developing new tools for securing IoT devices. Cisco's acquisition of IoT platform provider Jasper will help its cybersecurity tools reach more connected devices, and Symantec helps IoT device makers build more secure products. These efforts could eventually make IoT devices as secure as PCs or mobile devices. Privacy concerns Another key concern about the IoT market is privacy. Back in 2015, several German automakers expressed concerns about letting Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google track their drivers' activities in connected cars. That's why Audi, BMW, and Daimler teamed up to buy Nokia's HERE Maps as a Google Maps alternative later that year. A recent murder case for which an Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Echo might provide evidence also highlights the consequences of installing "always on" IoT devices in homes. Police and prosecutors believe that audio files from the device could help them crack the case, but Amazon has refused to turn over the files due to privacy concerns. Amazon Echo. Image source: Amazon. Privacy advocates believe that the case would set a precedent for letting law enforcement agencies access smart home devices. That would pose a problem for companies like Amazon, Google, and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which thrive on "learning" more about their users to produce targeted shopping and advertising experiences. The brewing IoT bubble Bullish forecasts about the IoT market have fueled a land grab across the market. That stampede yielded some innovative products like Amazon's Echo and Google Home, but the market is also filled with oddball devices like smart water bottles, fitness trackers for dogs, connected umbrellas, and smart tampons. The proliferation of frivolous devices suggests that a big bubble in the IoT market is brewing, similar to the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s in which websites were launched for all sorts of impractical purposes. And just like the dot-com bust of 2000, an IoT bust could purge the market of the weaker players and create a more refined field for leaders like Amazon and Google to expand their IoT ecosystems. The upcoming ecosystem war But as Amazon, Google, and other companies gradually advance into our homes, their ecosystems will start overlapping. Amazon will leverage its market-leading position in e-commerce and prisoner-taking Prime ecosystem to push devices like the Echo, Dash buttons, Kindle Fire, and Fire TV into homes to widen its moat against potential challengers. Google will leverage its knowledge of your search, web browsing, location, and ad-clicking histories to personalize its smart home devices like Home. Its connections to Android, the most popular mobile OS in the world, make its smart home platform a practical extension of mobile devices for many users. But that's not all: Apple is trying to tether IoT devices to its HomeKit platform, and Facebook plans to launch its Jarvis home AI in the near future. This means that the same battle that was previously waged across websites, mobile apps, and hardware will rage on in your living rooms next year. The key takeaways The Internet of Things is a fascinating new market, but investors should take companies' lofty IoT promises with a grain of salt. Security and privacy concerns will still loom large next year, while hardware and software companies will clash over competing ecosystems.

The full list of those exhibiting in the gaming and virtual reality category can be found here and include new virtual reality headsets, 3D cameras, motion and eye tracking technologies and 3D imaging. Dacuda and ZEISS will be showcasing the world’s first mobile room-scale virtual reality system that uses standard mobile phones on the ZEISS VR One headset. It employs an inside-out tracking system — meaning there is no outside camera that does position tracking. (Image courtesy Dacuda.) “This is groundbreaking because almost all mobile VR solutions currently on the market — including the excellent Samsung Gear VR and Google’s impending Daydream — have only three degrees of freedom tracking,” Dacuda spokesperson Vicky Sue told Hypergrid Business. Three degrees of freedom refers to headsets that only track if the user is turning their head — looking left and right, tilting the head left and right, and looking up and down. Six degrees of freedom adds straight-line motion in all directions, making for a more immersive experience. “Although Google Tango also offers six degrees of freedom on mobile phones with a world of, primarily, augmented reality capabilities, it also requires special hardware, such as a motion camera, structured-light projector, and an IR camera,” she added. Another company hoping to improve motion tracking is Ximmerse, which produces outside-in and inside-out room-scale mobile virtual reality systems. (Image courtesy Ximmerse.)   Lucid VR will exhibit its new LuciCam, a $400 180-degree 4K camera that enables anyone to create a true virtual reality and 3D video or photo and instantly share it on Facebook and YouTube. It’s different from popular 360-degree cameras like the 360fly and the Gear 360 because it captures depth, for a more realistic virtual reality video. Development kits started shipping yesterday and the general consumer version will begin shipping in the next three months, Lucid CEO Han Jin told Hypergrid Business. “With additional enhancements beyond its original specs, you can see it and try it yourself at the Lucid VR Booth 50,000 in Eureka Park, Sands Expo,” Lucid VR Spokesman Erica Zeidenberg told Hypergrid Business. “We have a limited number of review units as well.” 3dRudder will exhibit a new take on a motion controller that uses feet:       Vrtify has a virtual reality music library platform where, by working with artists and music publishers, it brings users to virtual concerts and recitals to experience music. The platform is in beta testing right now.   VR and AR conference sessions (Image courtesy CTA.) Eight conferences on virtual reality and augmented reality out of all the conference sessions at the CES 2017 will also bring together various players and stakeholders in the sector. They include: “VR-AR ThinkTank: Top Technology and Entertainment Companies” featuring Head of Entertainment Partnerships at Google AR/VR, Google Cardboard Aaron Luber among other speakers “Emerging Platforms Spotlight: Artificial Intelligence + Virtual Reality” featuring Director of Product Management at Sentient Technologies Myles Brundage among other speakers “AR, VR and the Future of Content” with CEO Emblematic Group Nonny de la Peña and Chief Strategist at VOKE VR, Intel Dr. S. “Jay” Jayaram as the speakers. “Virtual Reality Transforms Media – TV, Movies and News“; “The Future of Content: Cross-Platform Monetization“ “Hollywood’s Very Real Virtual Reality Push” featuring Senior Vice President Virtual Reality at Sony Pictures Entertainment Jake Zim and Senior Producer at Oculus Story Studio Kim as the speakers.

(KABC) KABC By Lori Corbin Tuesday, January 03, 2017 PLAYA VISTA -- We can ask chefs, grocers, and food forecasters what's the latest flavor, but we also know what's trending by counting searches on sites like Google and Pinterest. Gluten-free continues to be the biggest health food search on Google, while Pinterest found searches for Naan pizza up 175 percent. "Naan is a great bread alternative. It's good for things like pizza crust," said Janette Rizk of Whole Foods Markets. Rizk said their researchers found tonics and tinctures topping sales. Bone broth, turmeric lattes and juices were also a hit. 2017 NEWS: Top 5 apps for getting finances on track in 2017 Juicing is also a way to develop products from byproducts, which cuts food waste. "There's watermelon water that is made from ones that maybe aren't as pretty that are turned into cold pressed juice," said Rizk. Beyond sushi, Japanese-inspired street food is hot: Miso, mochi, noodles, and seaweed are all big sellers. Milk alternatives fill the fridge, including hemp, flax, grains, even peas. "We created Ripple to be dairy free the way it should be which is high in protein, low in sugar and really delicious. It's made from yellow peas believe it or not," said Ripple's co-founder Adam Lowry. It's also the year for the color purple. "We're seeing purple everything. Purple cauliflower, asparagus, sweet potatoes. It usually means there's more antioxidants," said Rizk. It's also found in chips and snacks. Sugar continues to take the heat as the bad guy while fat has been exonerated with research showing health benefits. And with new nutrition labels coming out in 2018, food manufacturers are looking for a sweet balance from sugars added to those naturally occurring in food. "We ship nationally right to your doorstep. The whole goal is to make food that is healing, foods that's inspiring to eat," said founder of Urban Remedy, Nica Pasquale. Meal delivery plans even meal kits are more fine tuned. Plus, groceries and restaurants are using third-party delivery systems like Instacart so you can have it when you want it without going to get it.

As Jeffrey Rosen has noted, “lawyers at Google, YouTube, Facebook, and Twit­ter have more power over who can speak and who can be heard than any president, judge, or monarch.” However, using antitrust laws to address this would be ineffective and likely illegal without new legislation.   ADVERTISEMENT While Duke does not propose how to break up the companies, presumably the government would force them divest their subsidiaries such as Facebook’s Instagram and WhatsApp and Google’s Youtube and Android. However, smaller companies are not necessarily more conducive to free speech.   Twitter, which is only the fraction of the size and value of Google or Facebook, is continually embroiled in controversy over its speech policies. All other significant, but still comparably small, social media platforms such as Pinterest, LinkedIn, Tumblr, Four Square, and Reddit have similar speech restrictions as Facebook and Google. "Antitrust should be used to break up partisan tech giants like Facebook, Google" https://t.co/jKnsrznOdJ pic.twitter.com/33ql2GcUHC— The Hill (@thehill) December 27, 2016 Breaking up the actual platforms would seriously harm consumers. Google’s algorithm improves with more searches and Facebook’s users value the ability to connect with the other billion people on the network. Reducing their size eliminates these benefits without increasing free speech. Antitrust regulators recognize this type of economy of scale, known as network effects, when evaluating a company’s market concentration. Increased social media censorship did not result from the market share of any company or even the political ideology of its executives. Facebook initially resisted calls to suppress “fake news,” while Twitter once called itself the “free speech wing of the free speech party.” Google refused to remove the controversial “Innocence of Muslims” film from Youtube, even when the White House pressured it to do so. Over the last year, many in the media along with advocacy groups like the Anti-Defamation League and the Southern Poverty Law Center have increasingly demanded the platforms remove supposed hate speech and, more recently, fake news. Politicians, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, recently criticized Facebook for facilitating fake news. This bad publicity creates financial pressure for social media platforms to restrict their content. Disney and Salesforce cited reputation concerns when declining to purchase Twitter. Why Disney won’t buy Twitter.https://t.co/Hiaz8o0YW8— Recode (@Recode) September 29, 2016 Additionally, many European countries require social media platforms to remove hate speech and are considering legal penalties against fake news. Some social networks set their global terms of service to comply with the more restrictive laws. Breaking up Facebook or Google into smaller companies does not remove these incentives. Even if it were desirable, the government lacks legal authority to use antitrust law to promote free speech. Over the years, activists have asked the Federal Trade Commission to consider tangential concerns such as privacy, employee wages, and environmental impact into antitrust regulation. The Commission explained in its Google/Doubleclick merger statement that while: “Such issues may present important policy questions for the Nation, the sole purpose of federal antitrust review of mergers and acquisitions is to identify and remedy transactions that harm competition.” The Federal Communications Commission considers public interest concerns, including viewpoint diversity, in merger review, but its jurisdiction does not extend to internet content providers. However, Congress can address internet speech directly without stretching antitrust law. Under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, interactive computer services including Facebook and Google receive immunity for their users’ content. The law is explicitly based on the finding that these services “offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse.” Who will check Facebook's 'fact checkers?'https://t.co/rJ9yLakOFG pic.twitter.com/rDXwqXihii— thehillexperts (@thehillexperts) December 19, 2016 To ensure this premise remains, Congress could condition large social networks’ immunity on remaining viewpoint neutral in any speech restrictions. The platforms could still prohibit harassment, doxxing, threats, and profanity. However, the law would require them to apply their policies neutrally and prohibit them from enacting viewpoint based rules. This would prevent Duke’s concerns that online platforms only “reflect only the Democrat Party line,” without violating the companies’ First Amendment right against compelled speech.   Social media platforms are tangled in a political tug-of-war over what speech they should or should not allow. They should welcome legislative guidance to remove them from an interminable debate. Those concerned about censorship from tech titans should offer them a way out, rather than try to break them up.   Mark Epstein is an attorney practicing regulatory and antitrust law in Washington, D.C.

This usually follows trends that are built up over the previous year, while newer trends make their way into the fold at the same time. This week, we look into the automotive crystal ball and state our predictions for the year ahead. If none of these actually happen, don't hold it against us because we're still recuperating from one of the worst years in recent human history. 2016, you will not be missed. 0 Share this with Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn E-mail Viber Copy this link Shaer Reaz Hyundai will be a rising giant in the luxury car market The South Korean manufacturer has been making waves in the executive segment in North America and elsewhere, undercutting Japanese rivals on price and offering bargains that are too difficult to ignore. 2016 was a year shaped by millenials in more ways than one, and their lack of badge snobbery in the face of logic means Hyundai has gained significant traction in the market. Which is why, late last year, they announced the official formation of the Genesis brand which will be supplying bargain luxury vehicles to young CEOs. Will it beat the well-rooted Germans? If they play their cards right, yeah.      China will see a torrent of new manufacturers with competing USPs.  So far, China has not had a single major hit in the international auto market – just a plethora of carbon copies meant for domestic use. All that seems set to change with Lynk&Co, a company launched by the people with stakes in Volvo. They showed off a concept recently that they are adamant they will build, complete with smartphone levels of sophistication. The 01 concept has a play store and offers an incredible level of personalisation touches, which if marketed right, could make Lynk&Co a force to be reckoned with.     Supercars will drive the efforts into efficient motoring through small, turbocharged hybrid engines. Ford's seminal supercar, the GT, was revived in 2014 as a twin turbo, small displacement 3.5 litre V6. All the major hypercar manufacturers like McLaren, Ferrari and Porsche have some sort of hybrid system in place that ups efficiency. If an American manufacturer with a history of V8 obsession can switch to greener, efficient powertrain, more manufacturers can be expected to follow suit.     Autonomous cars will undergo significant developments, inching towards showroom floors. Google, Tesla, Hyundai and others are investing billions into removing the driver from the equation, and with pretty much the same formula utilised, it's all about making a system that is better than your rival's. Tesla's autopilot feature is already on the market, but counting the number of negative reports about it, seems like they'll have to put in a bit more work. Google's adoption of sensors combined with machine learning looks promising, but how feasible it'll be is the question.      The dashboard of the average car will have exponentially fewer buttons.  Volvo and Tesla have already rid their interiors of unnecessary switchgear, opting instead for a large tablet-like screen that hosts all the menus and all the options for the air-con and multimedia. As manufacturers try and streamline the experience of driving and riding their cars, one possible issue that arises is long term usability. It'll be pretty difficult to sell your Volvo V90 in 4-5 years' time if the central control screen has dead pixels on it.     Traditionally Rear-Wheel-Drive performance cars will ad pt more efficient All-Wheel-Drive instead.  Mercedes landed a shock on the world's auto enthusiasts with the new E63 AMG S, which comes with a hooliganism-check: All Wheel Drive. Even traditional American muscle car enthusiasts got the AWD shock therapy as well, as Dodge revealed their plans of making the Challenger muscle car in AWD. It's likely that more manufacturers who've shunned the idea of all four wheels turning under power will embrace it in the coming year. Lotus Elise AWD, perhaps?      Electric cars will be cheaper and thus actual alternatives to cars aimed at the average consumer.  Right now, electric cars that are not the limited-range Nissan Leaf will cost you a fortune to buy. Tesla, quickly turning into the measuring stick by which all other electric car attempts are judged, has brought the Model 3 into the electric car ring, and is knocking everyone else down with its $35k price tag. That's still pretty high, but consider the effortless range, unbelievable level of equipment and overall quality that Tesla is now known for, and it'll quickly be clear that the Model 3 might be as significant for EVs as Ford's Model T was for the gasoline powered car.        An aftermarket tuning industry will evolve around electric cars, mostly Teslas.  Unplugged Performance and Brabus already have “tuned” versions of the Tesla Model S, but they've mostly focused on making the car's stance wider and bodywork more aggressive. However, we feel 2017 will be the year when the billion dollar aftermarket industry that caters to gasoline cars will turn to making electric cars faster around corners and even more juice for the straights.     Hydrogen Fuel Cell cars will finally have their fates sealed, although no one knows what that fate might be yet.  While other manufacturers run after electric vehicles in the pursuit of finding viable alternative fuel transportation, Toyota and a few others are staunchly striding towards Hydrogen. Toyota's Mirai has been on sale for a good whole year, and 2017 brings with it important questions that must be answered if Hydrogen is to be the future – questions of a refueling infrastructure, cost of R&D, government regulations, and scaling up while keeping costs down. It truly is the year of reckoning for any manufacturer involved in alternative fuels.      The traditional instrument cluster will be digitalised, and thus better utilised. Modern motoring is all about information – how fast you're burning fuel, how much tyre pressure you have at any given wheel, how long you have to wait till it's finally okay for you to snap and refuse to listen to Rebecca Black's new song any longer just because your kid cousin loves it. While the center console is being replaced by screens, the instrument cluster is more or less still analog. That's slowly changing, with Benz, Volvo and Lexus opting for digital instrumentation instead.      You will know at least one person directly who owns a crossover SUV.  In 2006, sales of crossover vehicles made up more than 50% of SUV sales in North America. A decade on, every manufacturer from Honda to BMW to KIA have introduced crossover SUVs into their lineup. Crossovers are one of the most popular types of vehicles sold new in North America, with other markets in other regions catching up fast to the notion of practical, funky, comfortable and an all-rounder of a vehicle like Toyota's recently launched CH-R. Expect more in 2017.      Electric motorbikes will start catching on as a viable alternative.  Much of the past couple of years has been spent on the electric car debate, while the issue of fossil-fuel-powered two wheelers has largely been left alone. We imagine it'll be an issue addressed in 2017, with more manufacturers like Zero Motorcycles coming up with fun, torquey and electric offerings like the S ZF6.5.  Copyright: Any unauthorized use or reproduction of The Daily Star content for commercial purposes is strictly prohibited and constitutes copyright infringement liable to legal action.

It’s easy to use, there is free software for it and it installs on most PCs (it can even can be installed alongside Windows). What’s the problem? Joe Hesse, West St. Paul   A: Linux, an open-source (shared for free) operating system, isn’t likely to become widely used on personal computers for several reasons. • No compelling need. Most people are content to use the well-known Windows or Mac operating systems that come with a new computer. They’re not inclined to switch to Linux because it doesn’t solve a problem for them; it’s just different. • Lack of compatibility. To emerge as a third desktop operating system, Linux needs to work with existing PCs and their accessories, such as printers and enhanced-graphics circuit boards. It’s still a long way from achieving that (see tinyurl.com/jofl4v9). • The Linux user base is tiny. It’s used by only about 2 percent of the world’s desktop computers. As a result, there’s no financial incentive for software developers to write compelling new programs for it. You have to rely on what people will develop for free. • Even Google can’t promote it for PCs. Google Chrome OS, a Linux-based desktop operating system, isn’t widely used. That’s not to say Linux can’t be a popular consumer product. Google’s successful Android operating system for smartphones and tablet computers is a version of Linux. Its success is partly because of its early introduction into a growing market. Android debuted in 2008, a year after the iPhone made smartphones a mainstream consumer product.   Q: My Acer eMachine EM250 netbook PC worked well until last summer. Then it slowed down so much when I was online that it became unusable, and the hard drive ran constantly. I’ve checked for viruses and reinstalled Windows 7, but it hasn’t helped. I want to keep the PC running because I use amateur radio software on it that won’t work with Windows 10. What can I do? Kevin Busse, Prior Lake   A: Your 2010 PC has only 1 gigabyte of RAM (random access memory). As a result, it’s being overwhelmed by more modern software, such as Microsoft’s Internet Explorer 11 browser and the latest Windows Update program. You can either try to minimize your PC’s memory usage or buy a newer Windows 7 computer; the latter is the better option. To reduce the PC’s RAM memory usage, make sure you are using only one continuously operating antivirus program. To minimize RAM use by Internet Explorer 11, reduce the number of add-on programs it uses, and empty its folders that hold temporary internet files and cookies (bits of computer code that identify you to certain websites). See the directions at tinyurl.com/hgb2sxt. While Windows 7 PCs are rapidly disappearing, it’s still possible to buy one with 4 gigabytes of RAM memory, which is enough to run most of today’s software. Refurbished Windows 7 desktops sell for less than $200 (without a monitor) at retailers such as Wal-Mart and Staples.   E-mail tech questions to steve.j.alexander@gmail.com.

Whomever the manufacturer will be has yet to be confirmed by Google, however we do know that they will retain the branding of said manufacturer, rather than the new Pixel or Google branding. This means the watches will be sticking with the branding convention we saw with the, now extinct, Nexus phones. Jeff Chang, product manager of Android Wear at Google, explained in an interview with The Verge that the new watches are part of a larger push to show consumers that smartwatches, specifically, but wearables in general, are still in demand. According to Chang, other manufacturers, aside from the unconfirmed initial one, will also be releasing new Wear devices for 2017. Once the new smartwatches have been released, Android Wear 2.0 will be released on “most recent smartwatches”, although some features – like Android Pay – won’t be included on devices due to hardware requirements.

MailOnline gives its verdict on Nintendo's latest console While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price.

Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

President-elect Trump's prospects of revitalising the US coal industry, and giving the oil and gas industry the expansionist dream ticket it wants, are very low. The risk of stranded assets is growing with every decision made by fossil-fuel companies to invest in yet more unnecessary fossil fuel projects: new coal mines, new oil and gas fields, new fracking, new fossil fuel power plants, and so on. As captains of the fossil fuel industries and their lobbyists prepare to take over the White House - appointed by a President elected by a minority, claiming to represent the people on an anti-elite ticket yet possessing by far the highest cumulative wealth of any cabinet ever - they will face evidence breaking out all around them of a fast-moving global energy transition threatening to strand the fossil fuels they seek to boost. "World energy hits a turning point", a Bloomberg headline read on 16th December. "Solar power, for the first time, is becoming the cheapest form of new electricity", the article marvelled. Analysis of the average cost of new wind and solar in 58 emerging-market economies - including China, India, and Brazil - showed solar at $1.65 million per megawatt and wind at $1.66. Google leads the giant corporations eagerly going with this flow. The largest corporate buyer of renewable energy announced on 6th December that it expects to hit its target of 100% renewable power in, wait for it, 2017. Google is a huge consumer of power, and going solar means deep emissions cuts, especially when solar infrastructure is hooked up with all the digital efficiency-enhancement fandangoes that Silicon Valley giants are zeroing in on in the fast emerging era of artificial intelligence in an internet of things. Google's emissions reductions will be meaningful even considering full product life cycles. Solar panels made today pay back the energy used to make them in little more than a year, a Belgian research team from the University of Louvain reported in December. "For every doubling of installed photovoltaic capacity", Atse Louwen and his colleagues write, "energy use decreases by 13 and 12% and greenhouse gas footprints by 17 and 24%, for poly- and monocrystalline based photovoltaic systems, respectively." This means that solar panels now return more energy than American oil: an average energy-return on energy-invested of around 14 (and rising) versus around 11 (and falling). From California to Mumbai, solar is the energy source of choice This is excellent news not just for rich Californians but for the developing world, where "solar lanterns and rooftop photovoltaics are becoming the energy of choice", so Bloomberg reported. In India, "the millions not connected to the grid may never connect" now, dooming much coal to be stranded underground in the process. The cumulative market of new Indian households accessing small-scale energy is potentially 200 gigawatts, with only a tiny fraction currently served. In Myanmar the government needs no further persuasion: it announced plans to bring solar to all as soon as 2030. The technical advances in batteries and electric vehicles also became ever clearer in December. "Diesel faces global crash as electric cars shine", the Financial Times announced. According to a UBS report, this whole category of oil use will be gone from the global market within ten years. The positives of EVs synergise with the negatives of air pollution to create a perfect storm for diesel. At the C40 cities summit, Paris, Mexico City, Madrid and Athens all vowed to ban diesel vehicles by 2025. In China, the worst air pollution this year put 24 cities on red alert, with schools shut and flights grounded. Half a billion people were affected by this 'airpocalypse'. In Chengdu, protestors took to the streets, putting smog masks on statues in the city centre. A heavy handed response by the police suggested that the government is super-sensitive to this issue. Which is not to say that the Chinese authorities aren't trying to abate the problem at source. I have summarised their rapid advances in renewables in earlier monthly reports. This month, a presentation in London by Zhang Gang, Counsellor of the State Council of China, revealed that China's efforts to use electricity more efficiently, cutting the need for coal, now involve 317 million smart meters in operation across 100% of urban areas and 70% of rural areas. These are hooked up in smart co-ordination, spanning all aspects of grids, at all scales, in a vast project involving 230 million users. Part of this co-ordination involves China's first expressway fast-charging EV network, stretching for 1,262 km between Beijing and Shanghai. No other country comes remotely close to this kind of smart-grid deployment. On 12th December, the International Energy Agency issued a report concluding that China's coal fired power plants "make no economic sense". Small wonder. India is on a similar rapid transition path. On 12th December the Central Electricity Authority announced that India does not need more coal-based capacity addition until 2022. The Authority now plans for non-hydro renewables to meet 43% of electricity as soon as 2027. Such an ambition would have been inconceivable until recently. On the 20th, Bloomberg analysed the widening gap between projected and actual demand in the world's third largest emitter, and put their conclusion in an encouraging headline: "India's energy forecasts are falling short and climate could win." Pass the fossil-fuel parcel? What are investors to make of all this? Well, it is rare for a report to hold the potential to change the world. But one published on 14th December did. The Recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) aim to give investors, lenders and insurers visibility of how climate-change risk will affect individual businesses, and a roadmap for reacting to it. The report presents the results of a year of deliberations by 32 representatives of companies with market capitalisation of $1.5 trillion and financial institutions responsible for assets of $20 trillion. Their intention is for the capital markets to behave consistently with the aims of the Paris Agreement on climate change, which is to say progressively retreat from fossil fuels, and increasingly favour clean-energy investments, not least renewables. A reminder of the background. The target of the Paris Agreement, agreed by every independent nation on the planet in December 2015, is to keep global warming at less than 2C. If society is to do that, most reserves of fossil fuel will have to stay underground, unburnt. Since companies view all reserves as having financial value, this means a risk - should governments do what they promised to do in Paris, or some it - of what investors call 'stranded assets': having money invested in a resource that you then can't realise. Investing any more money to add to this stock of potentially unburnable reserves creates what can be thought of as a 'carbon bubble'. The risk of stranded assets is growing with every decision made by fossil-fuel companies to invest in yet more unnecessary fossil fuel projects: new coal mines, new oil and gas fields, new fracking, new fossil fuel power plants, and so on and so on. The Bank of England awoke to this issue as a systemic risk in September 2015. After listening to arguments by Carbon Tracker, a financial think tank I chair, and other worried financial experts, they came to fear that fossil-fuel asset-stranding would risk wasting a lot of investment capital, and might even threaten global financial stability. The effort to stop this threat soon went international. The G20's Financial Stability Board set up a taskforce in December 2015 with a brief to specify the information investors need to be provided with in order for them to avoid stranded-asset risk. It is chaired by no less a figure than Michael Bloomberg. As soon as his Task Force's report came out out, more than 30 organisations - including Aviva, Axa, BHP Billiton, JPMorgan and Daimler - announced their support for its conclusions. Many more will surely follow, because the starting point in the TCFD's proposed roadmap is that companies should include climate-related financial disclosures in their public financial filings. Not to do so would be to ignore material risks to organisations, the Task Force professes. Those disclosures should span the core elements of how organisations operate: governance, strategy, risk management and the setting of metrics and targets. Crucially, the TCFD advocates, companies should align business models with a 2°C future. Remuneration of chief executives and boards should be linked to the extent to which their companies are hitting targets aimed at a sub-2C world. $5 trillion disinvested from fossil fuels Even before the Paris Agreement was adopted last year climate risk was high on the agenda of the world's largest institutional investors and asset managers. Resolutions asking oil and gas companies to stress test their business models against a 2C-consistent climate outcome were generally opposed by boards, but received record-high support levels from shareholders. Now there will be no hiding place. The TCFD report provides a template for best practices and a road map for better disclosure. Neither fossil fuel companies nor asset managers investing in them will easily be able to ignore it. Some investors have not waited for the G20 Task Force's advice. By the time of the December 2015 Paris climate summit, investment funds with collective assets of $3.4 trillion had either divested from all or some fossil fuels, or announced their intention to. This movement has continued to grow in 2016. On 12th December the value of funds divested passed $5 trillion. 80% of the funds involved, spanning 688 institutions, are managed by commercial investment and pension funds. This shows that the campaign is now mainstream in the capital markets. Capital is fleeing fossil fuels just as the fossil fuel industries manoeuvre their capos into the White House for the first time. What damage can a Trump administration do to this analysis? According to a PWC report this month, the impact they can have on global greenhouse emissions will be "pretty small", if others hold course. With the trends I have chronicled each month in 2016, and the declaration by all governments in Marrakech in November that the Paris process is "irreversible", a holding of course seems a more than a reasonable assumption. Trying to derail Paris, and revive coal, Trump will have to somehow suppress the progressive American states. His problem is that 33 states and the District of Columbia have cut carbon emissions while expanding their economies since 2000, including some Republican states. How do you persuade officialdom in those states to revert to a failed economic model that seeks essentially to recouple economic growth and fossil fuel use? Fifteen of the states, led by California, New York, Virginia, Vermont and New Mexico, have already told Trump that if he tries to kill US climate plans, they will see him in court. How has Big Energy coped on the transition frontier as 2016 came to a close? Two snapshots. The utility industry continues to be split into companies seeking to defend the fast shrinking status quo, and those now rushing to be part of the new world. One of the latter, Engie (formerly GdF Suez) announced that it sees the oil price falling to $10 as a result of current trends in energy markets, and the wave of clean-energy investments it and other major corporates are making. That would be interesting, should it transpire. For example, on 1st December BP gave the green light to a $9bn investment in a deepwater oilfield, rather appropriately named Mad Dog 2, due onstream (cue laughter, based on the industry's record of delivering major projects on time) in 2021. Good luck to them in recouping their investment if Engie's view of the world comes to pass. My conclusion, as the new year begins, is that the global energy transition is progressing faster than many people think, and is probably irreversible. Trump's prospects of resurrecting coal, and giving the oil and gas industry the expansionist dream ticket most of it wants, are very low. There is a caveat, of course: that he doesn't manage to blunder into a world war. All bets would be off then. In 2017, I will consider this wider security question in my summaries, plus the issues of cybersecurity and fast-emerging artificial intelligence and robotics. For they have all now become clearly relevant to the ultimate outcome of the great global drama in the energy-climate-data nexus.     Dr Jeremy Leggett is a British green-energy entrepreneur, author and advocate who is founding director of Solarcentury, one of the most respected international solar companies; founder and Chairman of SolarAid, a charity set up with 5% of Solarcentury's annual profits; and Chairman of CarbonTracker, a financial-sector think-tank warning of carbon-fuel asset-stranding risk to the capital markets.

SUBSCRIBE Paradigm shift: Has Google suspended defamation removals? Columnist Chris Silver Smith takes a look at what could be a recent policy shift in Google's longstanding informal policy of granting court-ordered defamation removal requests. Chris Silver Smith on December 30, 2016 at 12:02 pm More A number of attorneys who specialize in online defamation/libel cases have reported to me that Google has recently suspended its longstanding, informal policy of removing URLs from US search results that are specified in duly executed court orders. This poses a major paradigm shift for many victims of online reputation attacks. Beginning around August or September of this year, a number of attorneys from across the US began receiving blanket denials after submitting requests to remove defamatory content from Google’s search results. Since at least 2009, Google has had an informal policy of accepting many removal requests when accompanied by a properly executed court order specifying defamatory/libelous content at specific URLs. I’ve personally seen a number of cases where hundreds and even thousands of URLs have been submitted with court orders, and Google has removed those URLs from search results. But they’ve now stopped. Not for every single request, but for a sufficient number that it’s clear something has changed. Background: Search engines immune to libel removal demands It’s worthwhile to note that search engines, and various other types of online sites and services, were made immune in the United States from liability for things like defamation/libel by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”). For hundreds of years of established law, publishers (such as of books and newspapers) could be held responsible for content published through them. With the advent of the internet age, it was initially unclear how some types of websites should be categorized — were they publishers, and should therefore be held directly accountable for defamatory content, or were they merely distributors of others’ content, similar to libraries and bookstores, and should therefore not be considered liable for their content? There were concerns that categorizing all types of sites as publishers would potentially have a depressing effect on innovation and business in the nascent internet. As the Digital Media Law Project states, in 1996, Congress elected to clarify any ambiguity and to simultaneously provide protection for many types of sites by legally defining them as not being publishers: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. “interactive computer service” means any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server. Most courts have held that through these provisions, Congress granted interactive services of all types, including blogs, forums, and listservs, immunity from tort liability so long as the information is provided by a third party. Google’s help page for requesting removal of content cites Section 230 of the CDA for US users: Despite this signpost that outright states, “Google does not remove allegedly defamatory material from our search results…”, in practice, Google has long chosen to act upon court orders and removed libel and defamation from the search results (legally speaking, court orders identifying such content makes it no longer “allegedly”). For victims damaged by false statements online, Google’s de facto policy of removing defamation from their results has been a godsend. Google alters its policy around defamation removal requests I spoke with multiple attorneys specializing in online defamation across the country, and they all report similar responses from Google recently where the company declined to act on requests to remove URLs listed in court orders. The responses for these included a brief statement reading: “At this time, Google has decided not to take action.” It’s not unusual for Google to sometimes push back on such requests in instances where a court order is not specific enough, where the legal work has been sloppy or where URLs are incorrect. But the current denial responses do not appear to be due to those types of protocol mistakes. Some requests appear to be still undergoing reviews and consideration, and some related to prior removals appear to be still pending consideration. The door to defamation removals may not be completely closed. But some requests are simply being declined with no indication as to why. And they are the sorts of requests that were previously being reliably removed. Why has Google decided to halt this practice? We reached out to Google, but they have chosen not to make any official statement at this time. I’ve been informed that Google may still elect to act upon court-ordered libel/defamation removal requests if they choose, on a case-by-case basis. As their help page established, they consider themselves not legally obligated to do so. For the professionals who assist companies and individuals with legal removals, the lack of explanation around the apparent policy-shift or process-shift is very disturbing, and makes it difficult to convey reasonable expectations to defamation victims. And, in many cases, lack of action on Google’s part will create greater hardship for victims, or will even eliminate any real recourse at all. The abrupt change in policy has invited a lot of speculation. I know from multiple past discussions with various search engine company insiders that they consider removals to be undesirably costly, and that materials published on others’ websites are not particularly their responsibility. Quoting what one insider once told me, “This is a project that does not make money for the company, and does not save money for the company, so it is a low priority.” Electing to not take action on defamation removal requests seems in line with this. They are a business, and should not necessarily be motivated purely out of altruism, according to this line of thinking. It is undoubtedly costly. Google processes thousands of URL removal requests and maintains staff dedicated to all types of legal removal reviews. Removal requests may also be philosophically troubling in many instances. According to their Transparency Report, many removal requests citing defamation originate from government agencies and law enforcement. (Albeit, it seems likely that many of these removal requests may originate from countries that do not have as strong freedom-of-speech laws as found in the United States.) Perhaps Google is halting many US defamation removals to make a statement against censorship, here at the tail end of what could be the most rancorous political race in the world’s history. It’s undoubtedly upsetting for fair-minded employees to be in the position of sometimes removing URLs that critique governments and politicians for countries where it may be deemed illegal to say negative things about officials. But this does not seem to explain what is going on here, since the requests being submitted do not appear to be unfair attempts to censor, but rather malicious and untrue attacks on individuals and companies. Another explanation could be due to revelations from earlier this year that some unethical attorneys and reputation agencies have abused Google’s removal process and perhaps committed fraudulent actions in the process. In the spring, Pissed Consumer reported that a number of suspicious lawsuits with purportedly bogus defendants were filed in California courts to obtain defamation court orders enabling URLs to get delisted by Google. In October, Pissed Consumer sued a reputation management company and attorneys that are alleged to be behind “sham lawsuits” and “stooge defendants” that were used to fool Google into removing undesirable consumer reviews. It seems likely that the revelations around these abuses may have factored into the company’s decision to decline to act on some removal requests. Could it be that Google is now applying some more restrictive requirements around court orders that it will accept in the wake of the unethical manipulation? Possibly. But, having reviewed some of these requests, I don’t see sloppiness or commonalities with the sorts of things that Pissed Consumer has complained of. If motivated by the abuses alleged by Pissed Consumer, Google could merely be starting to demonstrate that they are autonomous in their decisions about whether or not to remove something. For the attorneys and their clients who are now failing to procure intervention on the part of Google after they have gone through ofttimes-lengthy and costly litigation processes, the abrupt apparent change in policy and lack of explanation are upsetting and confusing. Is this shift temporary? Should they continue to submit the requests again later? Should they modify the requests in some way? Does Google desire different verbiage in court orders now? Google is currently silent on the matter. But the statements that Google will not take action may be communicating all that victims may now expect: Your removal requests may be futile. Should search engines be immune from defamation removal demands? To a very large degree, search engines have become the internet. If something is not indexed by Google or Bing, or it isn’t searchable and prominent within the search engines, it might as well not exist. When people are seeking information about a subject, they turn to search engines. So, if the listings on the first page or two of search results contain false, negative and damaging items about a subject, this is where people are often most likely to encounter them. The search engines are the starting point, the gateway to the internet. Being able to remove results directly from Google largely snaps the connection between the public and the libelous/defamatory content. This option has been the best path for obtaining relief for many victims in terms of comprehensiveness and speed. Google’s suggestion that one should seek relief by going directly to a webmaster to get the damaging content removed at the source will not work for victims in many cases. If the originating site is also immune under the CDA, then one may not be able to get materials removed, and they will live on in the search results. Consider Ripoff Report — a site that allows people to post any claims, false or otherwise, about individuals and companies, but does not allow people to subsequently delete what they wrote. Ripoff Report’s policy is to never remove materials, even where one has court orders establishing that content is completely false and defamatory. Heretofore, one could obtain a court order to present to Google (read the definitive article on the subject, “How To Remove Ripoff Reports From Google — Not Just Bury Them“). Where sites like Ripoff Report are concerned, Google’s willingness to remove URLs with court orders has been the only source of relief available. The Section 230 protections of the CDA have resulted in many similar situations where no one may be legally required to correct or remove misleading and harmful materials. In yet other cases, websites hosted in foreign jurisdictions may also be beyond the reach of victims based in the US; the internet is a global economy, and without a global solution for false and damaging libel, people simply can become harmed in perpetuity. Few victims can afford to hire attorneys in other countries where defamation may be hosted, and some other countries may not provide the legal protections established through hundreds of years of tradition and precedent that are found in western countries. (Ironically, a person with dual US/EU citizenship might be able to legally require Google to remove damaging materials from being viewed by searchers within Europe, but not from searchers located within the United States.) If the only solution available is to take court orders to the websites where defamatory materials are published and persuade them to remove the stuff, then costs increase for victims, as their attorneys or online reputation agencies must go to many sites to remove stuff, rather than to a single source. I’ve seen multiple cases where defamatory content was spread across hundreds and even thousands of URLs. Instead of communicating with one entity, representatives must go to many, monitor them to see if they comply and follow up when they don’t. Inevitably, removal of defamatory content will also take longer if Google does not assist. Even if you persuade an originating website to remove something, the listing for it and cached version of the page can live on in Google’s search results for months or even years, continuing to damage one’s reputation. (Professionals may also circle around to ask Google’s automated system to remove the URL due to the page being removed, or one may request the Googlebot to respider the page to update the cached copy to eliminate removed content.) The human cost Most people do not feel strongly about online reputation attacks. That is, until their own reputations become impacted by some negative things. Those of us who work on these sorts of cases are aware that everyone is vulnerable to significant damage from misrepresentation. Many have a notion that they are good people, and therefore do not expect to have their reputations attacked in any way. But it only takes one obsessed customer. One crazy ex-girlfriend/boyfriend. One disgruntled employee. Once someone libels you on the internet, there’s a very good chance that the materials may find their way up on the first page of search results. Many people make the mistake of thinking that if they avoid having much about themselves on the internet, their reputation and privacy are protected. But privacy and reputation are separate and frequently unrelated entities. So, when something negative gets published into the mix, it can abruptly become prominent. Your data privacy is maybe intact, but your public reputation can be trashed. Even when one has a strong and established web presence, negative materials can often have an unfair advantage in rankings. Tomorrow, you can wake up and have your reputation ruined. Online lies can be horrific to endure. They can be so malicious. Imagine you’re the brilliant doctor who is falsely accused of malpractice. You are the business accused of being a scam and cheating your clients. You’re falsely accused of doing shoddy work. You’re accused of being a Mafia collaborator, a Nazi sympathizer, a pedophile, a nymphomaniac, a rapist or an adulterer. (This isn’t merely melodramatic hyperbole on my part — I’ve worked on cases where people were falsely accused online of each of these things.) When the lie is the thing that defines your identity, then you lose business, your company fails, and you cannot make new relationships. It can affect everything about your life. Defamation victims experience deep depression and sometimes consider suicide. Due to the frequency of psychological distress associated with online reputation issues, I interviewed a psychologist, and I refer my reputation clients to them. This stuff takes an extremely heavy toll on people. I’ve had clients who genuinely feared going out to restaurants because they had been accosted by people who had read and believed misrepresentation posted online about them. In a completely opposite direction last year, Google announced that they would accept removal requests for revenge porn — without even a court order being required. However, a number of porn revenge victims I’ve assisted had instances of defamatory written statements on various web pages in addition to images and videos published to harm them. So, ironically, Google’s current policy shift will make it so that these victims can theoretically get their images taken out of search with just a note to Google, while related defamatory written content might not be removed, even with a court order. If this new paradigm becomes status quo, the attorneys expert in these matters will likely halt assisting new clients, because there will be no way to reasonably predict positive outcomes, and risk of failure will be too high. If you’re defamed on Ripoff Report, which has over two million reports posted, you’ll be out of luck. Your only recourse in that case may be to change your name, as Google’s Eric Schmidt once infamously suggested. So, defamation victims in the future may find less legal representation available to assist them. In multiple cases I’ve worked on, reputation attack victims were subjected to extortion. They were threatened that if they did not pay or do something demanded, then an individual would ruin their reputation online by posting falsehoods or private information about them. When they did not pay up, the extortionist followed through, harming them severely. Here’s an example: “Convicted Search Engine Optimizer Indicted For Retaliating Against Former Victim.” While dramatic, this sort of case where the threat of online damage is used to extort people is not all that uncommon. In another example, one of Google’s own employees was arrested and convicted for attempting reputation extortion to compel women to send him nude photos. By revoking recourse to have defamatory listings removed, Google will be effectively enabling more criminally minded people to use the search engine’s inflexibility as part of their extortion schemes. Google’s policy change is exposing the large legal loophole created by the CDA: One may launch terrifically damaging materials, and those can rocket up in visibility and never be removed. Companies threatened by this may decide to simply pay up, rather than risk having to shutter, go bankrupt or lay off employees. It’s satisfying to have extortionists arrested and convicted, but from a business point of view, it’s a losing proposition if you can’t undo the evil damage that has torpedoed your company. There’s always the “Eric Schmidt solution”: change your name. But changing one’s name to side-step online reputation damage is very costly, too — in terms of money and/or emotional currency. If you’ve witnessed the costs for a company with a well-established brand name to change that name, you’ll know that this can be extensive and risky — replacing all signs, logos on letterheads, business cards, products, websites — all while losing the equity and recognition built in the name. I’ve also had a porn revenge victim that elected to change their name; it’s not an easy process, fraught with all sorts of issues you can’t foresee, and very difficult to explain to all who have known you by your original name. Even when you go through a business name change, the loss of identity can sink your company. As I described in “When Brand Names Are Destroyed By Damaging Doppelgangers,” some companies don’t survive this process, since it’s like starting all over with an unknown name. So, there’s nothing simple about a name-change, and one may not have the necessary amount of money on hand to even make that work. Is Google liable? Or could the immunity of the CDA be revoked? I’ve long thought that Google chose to act upon defamation removal requests out of a desire for self-preservation. I thought it was a calculated strategy both to avoid risks of legislature removing some of the immunity provided by Section 230 of the CDA and to reduce lawsuits that they might have to face from desperate people. The immunity provided by the CDA is a huge value to Google, and processing of defamatory removal requests is a relatively small price to pay. It’s possible for the legislature to modify the Section 230 protection. As I described above, it has enabled situations where horribly damaging false content can be published, and there’s no effective way to help the victims. It’s possible for legislators to wake up to this and to try to address the lacuna in the current laws. I think all it might take would be a handful of defamed children of congressmen and senators, and legislators might become very motivated to take action. There is also the fact that the largest search engines are quite different in nature than smaller forum operators, and even the social media services. The search engines are not the equivalent of small libraries or booksellers (which are considered “distributors” and therefore not responsible for the content they have under offline defamation assessments); they are frequently the doorway of the internet. And the search engines are large enough to be able to afford the costs and the scale of evaluating removal requests. Demonstrably, Google has been absorbing these costs for the better part of a decade, at least, while their stock value has consistently risen across this period. So concerns about absolving them from the costs of handling defamation are likely minor and irrelevant. Assisting online attack victims should perhaps be considered the cost of success. The search engines bear responsibility for the policing of the internet by making themselves so very central to people’s online activities. They created this large, public marketplace, so they inherently bear some responsibility for it. Why should they declare themselves responsible for making the internet faster, or for safeguarding privacy by browbeating webmasters into using SSL (secure sockets layer), or trying to make the internet more secure by flagging or suspending websites for malware — and then turn about to disavow any responsibility at all for defamatory content they index that destroys companies and lives? The omnipresence they’ve created means they must share some responsibility. The search engines have to employ removal evaluation staff anyway, because they are also receiving many other types of legal removal requests, such as in instances of trademark infringement, copyright infringement and personal privacy issues. There has been something of an imbalance in how the US has provided a high level of immunity around defamatory liability to online distributors/publishers of third-party content, while simultaneously ensuring the interests of big business are represented by making those same types of sites handle copyright infringement claims. There are also alternative options for addressing the costs, if that is the driving reason for suspending assistance. As I pointed out last year, it should be possible for Silicon Valley companies to set up a commonly supported online reputation clearinghouse that they could all utilize to share the evaluation costs. Take-down requests could be sent to a single location, evaluated, and then acted upon by the major players in concert with one another. This would potentially save on costs for all of those companies and also reduce some costs for reputation attack victims. Sure, this requires a level of cooperation among big tech companies, but the rewards could be significant. Costs of evaluations of removal requests are not going away. One attorney I spoke with stated that he would even be happy to pay a fee to Google for submitting removal requests. He acknowledged that there are costs involved for the search engines, and a handling fee might be reasonable — especially if the alternative is to lose any real substantive recourse. There is a possibility that Google’s abrupt about-face on these requests may open them up to legal liability now, in spite of the CDA protections. One might argue that Google’s long practice of honoring court-ordered defamation removals was an implicit acknowledgment of responsibility and liability for content presented through search results. Or a claim could be made on the basis of promissory estoppel — that attorneys and individuals have been reasonably assured by long practice that Google will remove content based upon court orders specifying defamatory content, and this abrupt and seemingly arbitrary suspension of that policy is wantonly damaging. Some of the instances where Google denied take-down requests have happened after victims pursued months or years of litigation to obtain court orders, and they did this with the reasonable expectation that Google would take action. These people are arguably damaged because they based their decisions to litigate on Google’s years of consistent policy. The timing for Google’s change in practice is surprising, because the legal climate around defamation laws is less certain right now. Back in February, Donald Trump made a campaign promise that he would “open up” libel laws, making it easier for famous persons to sue the press. Even more recently, Melania Trump is involved in a defamation lawsuit, claiming the press and a blogger have made false and damaging statements against her. As things currently stand, it’s conceivable that Mrs. Trump could win her case, but if her defamatory content were replicated on sites like Ripoff Report and elsewhere, then the content could live on, easily accessible via Google search results. Is it realistic that Trump might be able to change libel laws, and, if so, could it provide greater protections for all individuals or lessened immunity for web companies? It’s purely speculative, but the incoming administration definitely has a conservative philosophy about unfettered speech, and their party is in charge of both the Executive and Legislative branches of government. One has the feeling that they can enact any changes to the law that they might wish. And one can imagine they might be motivated if Mrs. Trump were to find herself balked subsequent to winning her case in court. Conclusion: Inconclusive, for now So, how should the online reputation management industry respond to Google’s recent de facto paradigm shift? Will they begin to grant such requests again, with the same level of consistency? Some types of websites and online services will respond to court-ordered defamation removal requests. I suggest that one first send those court orders to every single site and ISP where defamatory material is specified. After you’ve gotten as much removed at the website level as possible, then follow up with a submission of remaining URLs to Google, explaining you have attempted to get everything removed but you cannot do anything about the remaining URLs, and plead for them to take those last URLs out of search. Please let me know if you are successful, and I may post a follow-up report later. Likewise, if Google later responds, we will try to post an update on this article.

SUBSCRIBE 4 steps to make your organic listings more effective How can you improve your organic search results? Columnist Jason Decker outlines four basic steps to make your listings more compelling to searchers and prospects. Jason Decker on December 30, 2016 at 1:08 pm More You’re a savvy digital marketer. You follow Google best practices and read “all the SEO blogs.” You sound like a zookeeper with your extensive knowledge of Pandas, Penguins, Possums and Pigeons. You’re always looking for ways to improve organic search rankings. Instead of investing your time researching some of those gray (or even black) hat tactics that are oh so tempting, I suggest you take a step back and look at the basics of your organic SERP listing. An area that often gets overlooked by digital marketers is engagement and the click-through rate (CTR) associated with their organic listings. No matter how much you improve your ranking, if your listing itself is not compelling, it’s all for nothing! Google has not confirmed that CTR is a direct ranking factor, but this slide from a Google engineer at SMX West in March 2016 suggests that click-through rate plays a significant role. From How Google Works: A Ranking Engineer’s Perspective on SlideShare Regardless of Google’s ranking algorithm, all digital marketers strive to make organic listings compelling to searchers and enticing to prospects. These recommendations will help you improve organic search results and drive additional qualified traffic. Step 1: Identify pages with a relatively low click-through rate In Google Analytics, navigate to Acquisition > Search Console > Landing Pages and export the data into a CSV or Excel document. Identify pages with high Impressions, a low Average Position and a relatively low CTR based on position. AdvancedWebRanking.com has a great study on average CTR by position that you can use as a guide. This analysis will help you create a list of prioritized landing pages to be improved. Step 2: Find opportunities to expand title tags One of the best things you can do to increase the CTR for a listing is improve the effectiveness of the Page Title. Back in 2014, Google changed the Title Tag limit to be based on pixel length (estimated to be 512px) which resulted in a significant reduction in organic Title Tag width. In May of this year, SEOs everywhere rejoiced as Google expanded this limit to 600px, a 17 percent increase! Take advantage of this increased space and the opportunity to include more high-priority keywords (if you haven’t already). An easy way to view your current Meta Tags is to download them from the free Screaming Frog SEO Spider Tool. The challenge is that the new pixel-based limit is harder to adhere to and more difficult to visualize than a simple character count. For example, a “W” takes up more space than an “l.” It’s all about size now, not number of characters. As you’re improving and expanding your Meta Tags, I recommend using a SERP Preview Tool. This will help you visualize how your listing (URL, Title and Description) will appear on a Google SERP. After the Google SERP update in May, we noticed that popular SEO tools had not been updated to reflect the new guidelines, so we created our own Google SERP Tool to help SEO experts visualize the new, expanded pixel limits. Step 3: Make your meta tags more compelling The best Page Titles are often written like a newspaper headline. They are intriguing, interesting, descriptive, and often evoke emotion. Here is an example of two boring headlines and one compelling/engaging headline that really stands out. Title Tag tips It’s still crucial to have target keywords in your Title Tag, but don’t ignore the importance of engaging prospects. Optimize for user intent first, and SEO keywords second. Here are a few proven tips for Title Tags: If your web page provides a list of some sort, state the number of items. For example: 17 Delicious Broccoli Recipes Your Kids Will Love Mention if the page includes a video or a presentation. For instance: 10 Reasons Why The New Macbook Stinks w/Video Review Special characters stand out, but don’t go overboard. Mention pricing or sales numbers. Timely/relevant content is key. Provide a date. Example: The 12 Lightest Laptops Available in November 2017 Use a free headline analyzer such as: http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer Description tips Don’t forget to have a compelling and descriptive Meta Description as well. Use your Meta Description to complement and expand upon your Title Tag statement. Be persuasive; encourage an action. Since Meta Descriptions have no explicit SEO value (other than CTR), don’t be obsessive about forcing keywords into your Description unless they fit naturally. Most of all, inspire curiosity and entice searchers to click. Step 4: Make your SERP jump off the page with rich snippets The buzz for structured markup has quieted in the last few years, but this is a powerful strategy that should not be ignored. Rich snippets can really make your SERP jump off the page, increasing your CTR and stealing clicks right out of the hands of your competition. Using structured markup properly can really make your products stand out. This example below shows powerful information such as star rating, number of reviews, price and if the product is in stock or not. That’s a lot of valuable information in the search engine results! Using the Recipe structured markup can also be really powerful. In the snapshot below, you can see a large photo and most of the ingredients needed for a recipe. It really jumps off the page as the first result. For the second result, you notice the star rating, number of reviews, time to cook and, of course, a picture! Wow, that’s powerful. Recipe reviews are so popular that if you’re not using them, you may not make the first page of Google. The good news is that there are a variety of WordPress plugins and free tools to help make implementation very simple. Some other powerful rich snippets are breadcrumbs, music, (notable) people, video content and events. You can find a rich snippet to improve click-through rate for almost every page imaginable. Google has a great Guide to Structured Markup, a Testing Tool, and even a Data Highlighter to use structured markup from the Google Search Console without having to implement any code. There are no excuses for not using these free features! Getting back to basics Once you expand and enhance your Meta Tags, track progress in Google Search Console. Continue to test and improve your organic listing over time. You might be shocked by the dramatic increase in organic traffic delivered simply by getting back to the basics of writing a unique, compelling and relevant Page Title and Description. Remember, your Meta Tag is the only thing standing between a search result and a visitor!

SUBSCRIBE Paradigm shift: Has Google suspended defamation removals? Columnist Chris Silver Smith takes a look at what could be a recent policy shift in Google's longstanding informal policy of granting court-ordered defamation removal requests. Chris Silver Smith on December 30, 2016 at 12:02 pm More A number of attorneys who specialize in online defamation/libel cases have reported to me that Google has recently suspended its longstanding, informal policy of removing URLs from US search results that are specified in duly executed court orders. This poses a major paradigm shift for many victims of online reputation attacks. Beginning around August or September of this year, a number of attorneys from across the US began receiving blanket denials after submitting requests to remove defamatory content from Google’s search results. Since at least 2009, Google has had an informal policy of accepting many removal requests when accompanied by a properly executed court order specifying defamatory/libelous content at specific URLs. I’ve personally seen a number of cases where hundreds and even thousands of URLs have been submitted with court orders, and Google has removed those URLs from search results. But they’ve now stopped. Not for every single request, but for a sufficient number that it’s clear something has changed. Background: Search engines immune to libel removal demands It’s worthwhile to note that search engines, and various other types of online sites and services, were made immune in the United States from liability for things like defamation/libel by Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”). For hundreds of years of established law, publishers (such as of books and newspapers) could be held responsible for content published through them. With the advent of the internet age, it was initially unclear how some types of websites should be categorized — were they publishers, and should therefore be held directly accountable for defamatory content, or were they merely distributors of others’ content, similar to libraries and bookstores, and should therefore not be considered liable for their content? There were concerns that categorizing all types of sites as publishers would potentially have a depressing effect on innovation and business in the nascent internet. As the Digital Media Law Project states, in 1996, Congress elected to clarify any ambiguity and to simultaneously provide protection for many types of sites by legally defining them as not being publishers: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider. “interactive computer service” means any information service, system, or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server. Most courts have held that through these provisions, Congress granted interactive services of all types, including blogs, forums, and listservs, immunity from tort liability so long as the information is provided by a third party. Google’s help page for requesting removal of content cites Section 230 of the CDA for US users: Despite this signpost that outright states, “Google does not remove allegedly defamatory material from our search results…”, in practice, Google has long chosen to act upon court orders and removed libel and defamation from the search results (legally speaking, court orders identifying such content makes it no longer “allegedly”). For victims damaged by false statements online, Google’s de facto policy of removing defamation from their results has been a godsend. Google alters its policy around defamation removal requests I spoke with multiple attorneys specializing in online defamation across the country, and they all report similar responses from Google recently where the company declined to act on requests to remove URLs listed in court orders. The responses for these included a brief statement reading: “At this time, Google has decided not to take action.” It’s not unusual for Google to sometimes push back on such requests in instances where a court order is not specific enough, where the legal work has been sloppy or where URLs are incorrect. But the current denial responses do not appear to be due to those types of protocol mistakes. Some requests appear to be still undergoing reviews and consideration, and some related to prior removals appear to be still pending consideration. The door to defamation removals may not be completely closed. But some requests are simply being declined with no indication as to why. And they are the sorts of requests that were previously being reliably removed. Why has Google decided to halt this practice? We reached out to Google, but they have chosen not to make any official statement at this time. I’ve been informed that Google may still elect to act upon court-ordered libel/defamation removal requests if they choose, on a case-by-case basis. As their help page established, they consider themselves not legally obligated to do so. For the professionals who assist companies and individuals with legal removals, the lack of explanation around the apparent policy-shift or process-shift is very disturbing, and makes it difficult to convey reasonable expectations to defamation victims. And, in many cases, lack of action on Google’s part will create greater hardship for victims, or will even eliminate any real recourse at all. The abrupt change in policy has invited a lot of speculation. I know from multiple past discussions with various search engine company insiders that they consider removals to be undesirably costly, and that materials published on others’ websites are not particularly their responsibility. Quoting what one insider once told me, “This is a project that does not make money for the company, and does not save money for the company, so it is a low priority.” Electing to not take action on defamation removal requests seems in line with this. They are a business, and should not necessarily be motivated purely out of altruism, according to this line of thinking. It is undoubtedly costly. Google processes thousands of URL removal requests and maintains staff dedicated to all types of legal removal reviews. Removal requests may also be philosophically troubling in many instances. According to their Transparency Report, many removal requests citing defamation originate from government agencies and law enforcement. (Albeit, it seems likely that many of these removal requests may originate from countries that do not have as strong freedom-of-speech laws as found in the United States.) Perhaps Google is halting many US defamation removals to make a statement against censorship, here at the tail end of what could be the most rancorous political race in the world’s history. It’s undoubtedly upsetting for fair-minded employees to be in the position of sometimes removing URLs that critique governments and politicians for countries where it may be deemed illegal to say negative things about officials. But this does not seem to explain what is going on here, since the requests being submitted do not appear to be unfair attempts to censor, but rather malicious and untrue attacks on individuals and companies. Another explanation could be due to revelations from earlier this year that some unethical attorneys and reputation agencies have abused Google’s removal process and perhaps committed fraudulent actions in the process. In the spring, Pissed Consumer reported that a number of suspicious lawsuits with purportedly bogus defendants were filed in California courts to obtain defamation court orders enabling URLs to get delisted by Google. In October, Pissed Consumer sued a reputation management company and attorneys that are alleged to be behind “sham lawsuits” and “stooge defendants” that were used to fool Google into removing undesirable consumer reviews. It seems likely that the revelations around these abuses may have factored into the company’s decision to decline to act on some removal requests. Could it be that Google is now applying some more restrictive requirements around court orders that it will accept in the wake of the unethical manipulation? Possibly. But, having reviewed some of these requests, I don’t see sloppiness or commonalities with the sorts of things that Pissed Consumer has complained of. If motivated by the abuses alleged by Pissed Consumer, Google could merely be starting to demonstrate that they are autonomous in their decisions about whether or not to remove something. For the attorneys and their clients who are now failing to procure intervention on the part of Google after they have gone through ofttimes-lengthy and costly litigation processes, the abrupt apparent change in policy and lack of explanation are upsetting and confusing. Is this shift temporary? Should they continue to submit the requests again later? Should they modify the requests in some way? Does Google desire different verbiage in court orders now? Google is currently silent on the matter. But the statements that Google will not take action may be communicating all that victims may now expect: Your removal requests may be futile. Should search engines be immune from defamation removal demands? To a very large degree, search engines have become the internet. If something is not indexed by Google or Bing, or it isn’t searchable and prominent within the search engines, it might as well not exist. When people are seeking information about a subject, they turn to search engines. So, if the listings on the first page or two of search results contain false, negative and damaging items about a subject, this is where people are often most likely to encounter them. The search engines are the starting point, the gateway to the internet. Being able to remove results directly from Google largely snaps the connection between the public and the libelous/defamatory content. This option has been the best path for obtaining relief for many victims in terms of comprehensiveness and speed. Google’s suggestion that one should seek relief by going directly to a webmaster to get the damaging content removed at the source will not work for victims in many cases. If the originating site is also immune under the CDA, then one may not be able to get materials removed, and they will live on in the search results. Consider Ripoff Report — a site that allows people to post any claims, false or otherwise, about individuals and companies, but does not allow people to subsequently delete what they wrote. Ripoff Report’s policy is to never remove materials, even where one has court orders establishing that content is completely false and defamatory. Heretofore, one could obtain a court order to present to Google (read the definitive article on the subject, “How To Remove Ripoff Reports From Google — Not Just Bury Them“). Where sites like Ripoff Report are concerned, Google’s willingness to remove URLs with court orders has been the only source of relief available. The Section 230 protections of the CDA have resulted in many similar situations where no one may be legally required to correct or remove misleading and harmful materials. In yet other cases, websites hosted in foreign jurisdictions may also be beyond the reach of victims based in the US; the internet is a global economy, and without a global solution for false and damaging libel, people simply can become harmed in perpetuity. Few victims can afford to hire attorneys in other countries where defamation may be hosted, and some other countries may not provide the legal protections established through hundreds of years of tradition and precedent that are found in western countries. (Ironically, a person with dual US/EU citizenship might be able to legally require Google to remove damaging materials from being viewed by searchers within Europe, but not from searchers located within the United States.) If the only solution available is to take court orders to the websites where defamatory materials are published and persuade them to remove the stuff, then costs increase for victims, as their attorneys or online reputation agencies must go to many sites to remove stuff, rather than to a single source. I’ve seen multiple cases where defamatory content was spread across hundreds and even thousands of URLs. Instead of communicating with one entity, representatives must go to many, monitor them to see if they comply and follow up when they don’t. Inevitably, removal of defamatory content will also take longer if Google does not assist. Even if you persuade an originating website to remove something, the listing for it and cached version of the page can live on in Google’s search results for months or even years, continuing to damage one’s reputation. (Professionals may also circle around to ask Google’s automated system to remove the URL due to the page being removed, or one may request the Googlebot to respider the page to update the cached copy to eliminate removed content.) The human cost Most people do not feel strongly about online reputation attacks. That is, until their own reputations become impacted by some negative things. Those of us who work on these sorts of cases are aware that everyone is vulnerable to significant damage from misrepresentation. Many have a notion that they are good people, and therefore do not expect to have their reputations attacked in any way. But it only takes one obsessed customer. One crazy ex-girlfriend/boyfriend. One disgruntled employee. Once someone libels you on the internet, there’s a very good chance that the materials may find their way up on the first page of search results. Many people make the mistake of thinking that if they avoid having much about themselves on the internet, their reputation and privacy are protected. But privacy and reputation are separate and frequently unrelated entities. So, when something negative gets published into the mix, it can abruptly become prominent. Your data privacy is maybe intact, but your public reputation can be trashed. Even when one has a strong and established web presence, negative materials can often have an unfair advantage in rankings. Tomorrow, you can wake up and have your reputation ruined. Online lies can be horrific to endure. They can be so malicious. Imagine you’re the brilliant doctor who is falsely accused of malpractice. You are the business accused of being a scam and cheating your clients. You’re falsely accused of doing shoddy work. You’re accused of being a Mafia collaborator, a Nazi sympathizer, a pedophile, a nymphomaniac, a rapist or an adulterer. (This isn’t merely melodramatic hyperbole on my part — I’ve worked on cases where people were falsely accused online of each of these things.) When the lie is the thing that defines your identity, then you lose business, your company fails, and you cannot make new relationships. It can affect everything about your life. Defamation victims experience deep depression and sometimes consider suicide. Due to the frequency of psychological distress associated with online reputation issues, I interviewed a psychologist, and I refer my reputation clients to them. This stuff takes an extremely heavy toll on people. I’ve had clients who genuinely feared going out to restaurants because they had been accosted by people who had read and believed misrepresentation posted online about them. In a completely opposite direction last year, Google announced that they would accept removal requests for revenge porn — without even a court order being required. However, a number of porn revenge victims I’ve assisted had instances of defamatory written statements on various web pages in addition to images and videos published to harm them. So, ironically, Google’s current policy shift will make it so that these victims can theoretically get their images taken out of search with just a note to Google, while related defamatory written content might not be removed, even with a court order. If this new paradigm becomes status quo, the attorneys expert in these matters will likely halt assisting new clients, because there will be no way to reasonably predict positive outcomes, and risk of failure will be too high. If you’re defamed on Ripoff Report, which has over two million reports posted, you’ll be out of luck. Your only recourse in that case may be to change your name, as Google’s Eric Schmidt once infamously suggested. So, defamation victims in the future may find less legal representation available to assist them. In multiple cases I’ve worked on, reputation attack victims were subjected to extortion. They were threatened that if they did not pay or do something demanded, then an individual would ruin their reputation online by posting falsehoods or private information about them. When they did not pay up, the extortionist followed through, harming them severely. Here’s an example: “Convicted Search Engine Optimizer Indicted For Retaliating Against Former Victim.” While dramatic, this sort of case where the threat of online damage is used to extort people is not all that uncommon. In another example, one of Google’s own employees was arrested and convicted for attempting reputation extortion to compel women to send him nude photos. By revoking recourse to have defamatory listings removed, Google will be effectively enabling more criminally minded people to use the search engine’s inflexibility as part of their extortion schemes. Google’s policy change is exposing the large legal loophole created by the CDA: One may launch terrifically damaging materials, and those can rocket up in visibility and never be removed. Companies threatened by this may decide to simply pay up, rather than risk having to shutter, go bankrupt or lay off employees. It’s satisfying to have extortionists arrested and convicted, but from a business point of view, it’s a losing proposition if you can’t undo the evil damage that has torpedoed your company. There’s always the “Eric Schmidt solution”: change your name. But changing one’s name to side-step online reputation damage is very costly, too — in terms of money and/or emotional currency. If you’ve witnessed the costs for a company with a well-established brand name to change that name, you’ll know that this can be extensive and risky — replacing all signs, logos on letterheads, business cards, products, websites — all while losing the equity and recognition built in the name. I’ve also had a porn revenge victim that elected to change their name; it’s not an easy process, fraught with all sorts of issues you can’t foresee, and very difficult to explain to all who have known you by your original name. Even when you go through a business name change, the loss of identity can sink your company. As I described in “When Brand Names Are Destroyed By Damaging Doppelgangers,” some companies don’t survive this process, since it’s like starting all over with an unknown name. So, there’s nothing simple about a name-change, and one may not have the necessary amount of money on hand to even make that work. Is Google liable? Or could the immunity of the CDA be revoked? I’ve long thought that Google chose to act upon defamation removal requests out of a desire for self-preservation. I thought it was a calculated strategy both to avoid risks of legislature removing some of the immunity provided by Section 230 of the CDA and to reduce lawsuits that they might have to face from desperate people. The immunity provided by the CDA is a huge value to Google, and processing of defamatory removal requests is a relatively small price to pay. It’s possible for the legislature to modify the Section 230 protection. As I described above, it has enabled situations where horribly damaging false content can be published, and there’s no effective way to help the victims. It’s possible for legislators to wake up to this and to try to address the lacuna in the current laws. I think all it might take would be a handful of defamed children of congressmen and senators, and legislators might become very motivated to take action. There is also the fact that the largest search engines are quite different in nature than smaller forum operators, and even the social media services. The search engines are not the equivalent of small libraries or booksellers (which are considered “distributors” and therefore not responsible for the content they have under offline defamation assessments); they are frequently the doorway of the internet. And the search engines are large enough to be able to afford the costs and the scale of evaluating removal requests. Demonstrably, Google has been absorbing these costs for the better part of a decade, at least, while their stock value has consistently risen across this period. So concerns about absolving them from the costs of handling defamation are likely minor and irrelevant. Assisting online attack victims should perhaps be considered the cost of success. The search engines bear responsibility for the policing of the internet by making themselves so very central to people’s online activities. They created this large, public marketplace, so they inherently bear some responsibility for it. Why should they declare themselves responsible for making the internet faster, or for safeguarding privacy by browbeating webmasters into using SSL (secure sockets layer), or trying to make the internet more secure by flagging or suspending websites for malware — and then turn about to disavow any responsibility at all for defamatory content they index that destroys companies and lives? The omnipresence they’ve created means they must share some responsibility. The search engines have to employ removal evaluation staff anyway, because they are also receiving many other types of legal removal requests, such as in instances of trademark infringement, copyright infringement and personal privacy issues. There has been something of an imbalance in how the US has provided a high level of immunity around defamatory liability to online distributors/publishers of third-party content, while simultaneously ensuring the interests of big business are represented by making those same types of sites handle copyright infringement claims. There are also alternative options for addressing the costs, if that is the driving reason for suspending assistance. As I pointed out last year, it should be possible for Silicon Valley companies to set up a commonly supported online reputation clearinghouse that they could all utilize to share the evaluation costs. Take-down requests could be sent to a single location, evaluated, and then acted upon by the major players in concert with one another. This would potentially save on costs for all of those companies and also reduce some costs for reputation attack victims. Sure, this requires a level of cooperation among big tech companies, but the rewards could be significant. Costs of evaluations of removal requests are not going away. One attorney I spoke with stated that he would even be happy to pay a fee to Google for submitting removal requests. He acknowledged that there are costs involved for the search engines, and a handling fee might be reasonable — especially if the alternative is to lose any real substantive recourse. There is a possibility that Google’s abrupt about-face on these requests may open them up to legal liability now, in spite of the CDA protections. One might argue that Google’s long practice of honoring court-ordered defamation removals was an implicit acknowledgment of responsibility and liability for content presented through search results. Or a claim could be made on the basis of promissory estoppel — that attorneys and individuals have been reasonably assured by long practice that Google will remove content based upon court orders specifying defamatory content, and this abrupt and seemingly arbitrary suspension of that policy is wantonly damaging. Some of the instances where Google denied take-down requests have happened after victims pursued months or years of litigation to obtain court orders, and they did this with the reasonable expectation that Google would take action. These people are arguably damaged because they based their decisions to litigate on Google’s years of consistent policy. The timing for Google’s change in practice is surprising, because the legal climate around defamation laws is less certain right now. Back in February, Donald Trump made a campaign promise that he would “open up” libel laws, making it easier for famous persons to sue the press. Even more recently, Melania Trump is involved in a defamation lawsuit, claiming the press and a blogger have made false and damaging statements against her. As things currently stand, it’s conceivable that Mrs. Trump could win her case, but if her defamatory content were replicated on sites like Ripoff Report and elsewhere, then the content could live on, easily accessible via Google search results. Is it realistic that Trump might be able to change libel laws, and, if so, could it provide greater protections for all individuals or lessened immunity for web companies? It’s purely speculative, but the incoming administration definitely has a conservative philosophy about unfettered speech, and their party is in charge of both the Executive and Legislative branches of government. One has the feeling that they can enact any changes to the law that they might wish. And one can imagine they might be motivated if Mrs. Trump were to find herself balked subsequent to winning her case in court. Conclusion: Inconclusive, for now So, how should the online reputation management industry respond to Google’s recent de facto paradigm shift? Will they begin to grant such requests again, with the same level of consistency? Some types of websites and online services will respond to court-ordered defamation removal requests. I suggest that one first send those court orders to every single site and ISP where defamatory material is specified. After you’ve gotten as much removed at the website level as possible, then follow up with a submission of remaining URLs to Google, explaining you have attempted to get everything removed but you cannot do anything about the remaining URLs, and plead for them to take those last URLs out of search. Please let me know if you are successful, and I may post a follow-up report later. Likewise, if Google later responds, we will try to post an update on this article.

SUBSCRIBE 4 steps to make your organic listings more effective How can you improve your organic search results? Columnist Jason Decker outlines four basic steps to make your listings more compelling to searchers and prospects. Jason Decker on December 30, 2016 at 1:08 pm More You’re a savvy digital marketer. You follow Google best practices and read “all the SEO blogs.” You sound like a zookeeper with your extensive knowledge of Pandas, Penguins, Possums and Pigeons. You’re always looking for ways to improve organic search rankings. Instead of investing your time researching some of those gray (or even black) hat tactics that are oh so tempting, I suggest you take a step back and look at the basics of your organic SERP listing. An area that often gets overlooked by digital marketers is engagement and the click-through rate (CTR) associated with their organic listings. No matter how much you improve your ranking, if your listing itself is not compelling, it’s all for nothing! Google has not confirmed that CTR is a direct ranking factor, but this slide from a Google engineer at SMX West in March 2016 suggests that click-through rate plays a significant role. From How Google Works: A Ranking Engineer’s Perspective on SlideShare Regardless of Google’s ranking algorithm, all digital marketers strive to make organic listings compelling to searchers and enticing to prospects. These recommendations will help you improve organic search results and drive additional qualified traffic. Step 1: Identify pages with a relatively low click-through rate In Google Analytics, navigate to Acquisition > Search Console > Landing Pages and export the data into a CSV or Excel document. Identify pages with high Impressions, a low Average Position and a relatively low CTR based on position. AdvancedWebRanking.com has a great study on average CTR by position that you can use as a guide. This analysis will help you create a list of prioritized landing pages to be improved. Step 2: Find opportunities to expand title tags One of the best things you can do to increase the CTR for a listing is improve the effectiveness of the Page Title. Back in 2014, Google changed the Title Tag limit to be based on pixel length (estimated to be 512px) which resulted in a significant reduction in organic Title Tag width. In May of this year, SEOs everywhere rejoiced as Google expanded this limit to 600px, a 17 percent increase! Take advantage of this increased space and the opportunity to include more high-priority keywords (if you haven’t already). An easy way to view your current Meta Tags is to download them from the free Screaming Frog SEO Spider Tool. The challenge is that the new pixel-based limit is harder to adhere to and more difficult to visualize than a simple character count. For example, a “W” takes up more space than an “l.” It’s all about size now, not number of characters. As you’re improving and expanding your Meta Tags, I recommend using a SERP Preview Tool. This will help you visualize how your listing (URL, Title and Description) will appear on a Google SERP. After the Google SERP update in May, we noticed that popular SEO tools had not been updated to reflect the new guidelines, so we created our own Google SERP Tool to help SEO experts visualize the new, expanded pixel limits. Step 3: Make your meta tags more compelling The best Page Titles are often written like a newspaper headline. They are intriguing, interesting, descriptive, and often evoke emotion. Here is an example of two boring headlines and one compelling/engaging headline that really stands out. Title Tag tips It’s still crucial to have target keywords in your Title Tag, but don’t ignore the importance of engaging prospects. Optimize for user intent first, and SEO keywords second. Here are a few proven tips for Title Tags: If your web page provides a list of some sort, state the number of items. For example: 17 Delicious Broccoli Recipes Your Kids Will Love Mention if the page includes a video or a presentation. For instance: 10 Reasons Why The New Macbook Stinks w/Video Review Special characters stand out, but don’t go overboard. Mention pricing or sales numbers. Timely/relevant content is key. Provide a date. Example: The 12 Lightest Laptops Available in November 2017 Use a free headline analyzer such as: http://coschedule.com/headline-analyzer Description tips Don’t forget to have a compelling and descriptive Meta Description as well. Use your Meta Description to complement and expand upon your Title Tag statement. Be persuasive; encourage an action. Since Meta Descriptions have no explicit SEO value (other than CTR), don’t be obsessive about forcing keywords into your Description unless they fit naturally. Most of all, inspire curiosity and entice searchers to click. Step 4: Make your SERP jump off the page with rich snippets The buzz for structured markup has quieted in the last few years, but this is a powerful strategy that should not be ignored. Rich snippets can really make your SERP jump off the page, increasing your CTR and stealing clicks right out of the hands of your competition. Using structured markup properly can really make your products stand out. This example below shows powerful information such as star rating, number of reviews, price and if the product is in stock or not. That’s a lot of valuable information in the search engine results! Using the Recipe structured markup can also be really powerful. In the snapshot below, you can see a large photo and most of the ingredients needed for a recipe. It really jumps off the page as the first result. For the second result, you notice the star rating, number of reviews, time to cook and, of course, a picture! Wow, that’s powerful. Recipe reviews are so popular that if you’re not using them, you may not make the first page of Google. The good news is that there are a variety of WordPress plugins and free tools to help make implementation very simple. Some other powerful rich snippets are breadcrumbs, music, (notable) people, video content and events. You can find a rich snippet to improve click-through rate for almost every page imaginable. Google has a great Guide to Structured Markup, a Testing Tool, and even a Data Highlighter to use structured markup from the Google Search Console without having to implement any code. There are no excuses for not using these free features! Getting back to basics Once you expand and enhance your Meta Tags, track progress in Google Search Console. Continue to test and improve your organic listing over time. You might be shocked by the dramatic increase in organic traffic delivered simply by getting back to the basics of writing a unique, compelling and relevant Page Title and Description. Remember, your Meta Tag is the only thing standing between a search result and a visitor!

Waymo's fully self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan. Credit: Waymo/Alphabet Inc. Most Popular Car electronics supplier Delphi Automotive Plc went coast-to-coast in 2015 in a self-driving Audi Q5 sport-utility vehicle to prove the autonomous automobile had arrived. Now, Delphi is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, the company will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. "The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, 'Look what it can do,'" said Glen De Vos, Delphi's VP-advanced engineering. "This year, the discussion is all about the path to production." Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it's in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens Jan. 5, the talk won't be about proving technology -- it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. "We're close to bringing this to a lot of people," John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. "We're kind of at an inflection point." At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21% more than last year. Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomy business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42 billion by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. "CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era," said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. "Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield." Prius Problem One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. "Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer's mind," Mr. Wakefield said. "Then when you come out with one, it's like, 'Oh, you make one, too?"' Google's self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than 2 million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn't yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Google's Project Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. "Google's playbook here is well-tested," said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer of Zendrive, a transportation data startup, who formerly worked on Android. "They understand how to use the platform to create dominance." Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the backseat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which announced last week its test fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. Acclimating Consumers The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. "Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure," Mr. Wakefield said. "As they gain confidence and think, 'Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,' GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise." It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. "The high cost isn't solved yet," Mr. Wakefield said. "There's not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two." Safety Improvements The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. "It took air bags 15 years to get high penetration in cars," Mr. Jonas said. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla -- which doesn't exhibit at shows such as CES -- may be the biggest accelerant for autonomy. Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which puts pressure on other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. "Tesla is being a disrupter," Mr. Wakefield said. "Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product." Regulatory Changes Autonomy also is getting a boost from U.S. regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. "Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule," said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now "you're going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers." For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70%, Mr. De Vos said. "The economics are really compelling," said Mr. De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi's driverless car in Las Vegas. "After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers." -- Keith Naughton and Mark Bergen, Bloomberg News In this article: Automotive CMO Strategy Special Report: Consumer Electronics Show Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

On January 15th, Linksys will release its mesh network-capable Velop router in Canada, the company announced today at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Each Velop, available in kits that include one, two or three separate units, is a tri-band AC2200 router, and can also act as range extender, access point and bridge. In the past, if a homeowner wanted to extend the coverage of their in-home Wi-Fi network, they had to depend on devices called Wi-Fi extenders. In this regard, mesh networks present two main advantages over traditional home Wi-Fi setups. Unlike when connecting to an extender, users do not experience a loss in Wi-Fi speed when connecting to any part of a mesh network. Moreover, each part of a mesh network is not a separate Wi-Fi network, which enables a seamless Wi-Fi experience while walking about one’s home. Despite the potential for a complicated setup, Linksys says initial setup is easy with its accompanying mobile app, which can provide suggestions on where to place each node in the network. After setup is complete, the app acts a management tool, enabling functions like parental controls. As with other mesh network router setups, the Velop is not cheap. A single unit is priced at $249.99 CAD, while the two pack and three pack are priced at $500 CAD and $650 CAD, respectively.

Car electronics supplier Delphi Automotive Plc went coast-to-coast in 2015 in a self-driving Audi Q5 sport-utility vehicle to prove the autonomous automobile had arrived. Now, the Troy-based company is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, Delphi will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. "The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, 'Look what it can do,'" said Glen De Vos, Delphi's vice president of advanced engineering. "This year, the discussion is all about the path to production." Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it's in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens Thursday, the talk won't be about proving technology — it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. "We're close to bringing this to a lot of people," John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. "We're kind of at an inflection point." At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21 percent more than last year. Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomy business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42 billion by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. "CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era," said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. "Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield." Prius problem One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. "Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer's mind," Wakefield said. "Then when you come out with one, it's like, 'Oh, you make one, too?"' Google's self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than 2 million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn't yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Unlike traditional automakers, Alphabet's businesses tend to focus on recurring revenue streams, such as search ads. Google's project Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. "Google's playbook here is well-tested," said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer of Zendrive, a transportation data startup, who formerly worked on Android. "They understand how to use the platform to create dominance." Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the backseat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which said last week its test-fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. Acclimating consumers The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. "Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure," Wakefield said. "As they gain confidence and think, 'Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,' GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise." It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. "The high cost isn't solved yet," Wakefield said. "There's not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two." Safety improvements The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. "It took airbags 15 years to get high penetration in cars," Jonas said. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Tesla -- which doesn't exhibit at shows such as CES — may be the biggest accelerant for autonomy. Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. CEO Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which puts pressure on other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. "Tesla is being a disrupter," Wakefield said. "Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product." Regulatory changes Autonomy also is getting a boost from U.S. regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. "Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule," said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now "you're going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers." For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70 percent, De Vos said. "The economics are really compelling," said De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi's driverless car in Las Vegas. "After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers." Michigan Morning Newsletter Get a roundup of important news that happens each day.

This new feature will allow owners of new Hyundai vehicles to control various functions their cars with voice commands via Google Home… Google Assistant support will let you control a lot of the same things that Blue Link allows you to control via your smartphone or smartwatch. For example, you can ask Google Assistant about a nearby restaurant and then follow that with “Ok Google, tell Blue Link to send the address to my Santa Fe.” You can also use the new commands to set the temperature in your car, start charging your Hyundai IONIQ, and control other basic Blue Link functionality like locking and unlocking your vehicle, and remote start, horn and lights. Most of these commands will require you to provide your Blue Link PIN, so they’re always secure (as long as no one else is around to hear you verbally provide your PIN…). The company’s press release offered up some examples of voice commands that are supported such as, “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to send the address of the Mandarin Oriental, in Las Vegas to my Sonata”, and “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to lock my car”. Other examples of commands that can be used are listed below, and Hyundai will be showing off the integration in action at Pepcom at CES on Wednesday night. It hasn’t yet announced when the functionality might become available to users, however. We’ll be on the ground to check it out first hand, so stay tuned to 9to5Google for all the latest Android and Google-related updates this week. FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif., Jan. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — In an integration highlighting the increasing connection between cars and the home, Hyundai is demonstrating compatibility with the company’s Blue Link Agent for the Google Assistant. The integration, which Hyundai will be demonstrating at Pepcom’s Digital Experience prior to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES®) on January 4, allows control of various functions of a Hyundai vehicle with simple voice commands. These commands include “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start my Santa Fe and set the temperature to 72 degrees”, “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to send the address of the Mandarin Oriental, in Las Vegas to my Sonata”, and “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to lock my car”. “Our customers are finding smart home integrations like the one we are showcasing with Google Home to be very useful and convenient,” said Manish Mehrotra, director, digital business planning and connected operations, Hyundai Motor America. “We will continue to add layers of convenience to the Blue Link connected car system and our cars, making features like remote EV charge management, remote locking, temperature and remote start easier than ever while sitting on the couch and saying ‘Ok Google’.” Google Home is a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant that can provide real-time answers, activate streaming music services, smart home devices, and now, cars. Blue Link brings seamless connectivity directly into Hyundai cars with technology like Remote Start with Climate Control, Destination Search powered by Google®, Remote Door Lock/Unlock, Car Finder, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, and Stolen Vehicle Recovery. Blue Link services can be easily accessed from the buttons on the rearview mirror and center stack, the Web or via the Blue Link owners’ smartphone app. In addition to the Action on Google Assistant, some of these features can also be controlled via the latest Android Wear™ and Apple Watch™ smartwatch offerings. How It Works To send commands to the Hyundai Vehicles via the Google Assistant on Google Home, engineers developed a way to link a customer’s Blue Link Account with the Google Assistant voice activated services. Once a customer has successfully linked his or her account, Remote Service commands will only be sent to Hyundai vehicles after the Google Assistant prompts owners for their Blue Link Personal Identification Number (PIN). Examples of Exchanges between Google Home and Hyundai Blue Link Example User Statement to Google Assistant Example Google Assistant’s Response to User “Ok Google, Find me a great steakhouse in Las Vegas.” “The address I found for a great steak house in Las Vegas is SW Steak House at 3131 South Las Vegas Boulevard, Las Vegas, Nevada 89109.  Do you wish to send it to your Sonata?” “Ok Google, tell Blue Link to send the address to my Santa Fe.” “The destination has been sent.” “Ok Google, what is the weather like today?” “Today’s forecast for Ann Arbor is 38 degrees with rain and snow.” “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to Start my Tucson and set the temperature to 75 degrees.” “To remote start and set climate control of your Tucson please say your Blue Link PIN.” “9115.” “Your request to remote start and set climate control of your Tucson has been sent.” “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start charging my IONIQ” “Please say your Blue Link PIN.” “1978.” “Your request has been sent. Your IONIQ is now charging. Blue Link Action on Google Home demonstration features include: Sending a destination to the car’s navigation system Remote horn/lights Start and stop charging of Hyundai plug-in vehicles Remote Start with Climate Control Hyundai will have more features before launching this Action on Google Home into production.

Hyundai is showing off this tech at CES this year, which allows Hyundai vehicle owners to do things like ask Google to start their car, transfer an address to their vehicle or lock the doors. The integration works via Hyundai’s Blue Link software, which you tell Google Assistant to interact with in order to control connected features on the cars. It’s similar to how car companies, including Hyundai, are working with Echo and Amazon Alexa, and it’s primarily designed to be accessed via Google Home. It also requires that a Hyundai car owner provide Google Assistant with their Blue Link PIN to ensure they actually have the authority to control the vehicle. Other controls possible via the connection include operating the horn and lights, stopping and resuming charging of Hyundai plug-ins and more. The Home service isn’t yet in production, but should come to compatible vehicles soon.

READ MORE READ MORE READ MORE Share Pete Pachal Jan 3rd 2017 11:02AM The first tech event of 2017 is also the year's biggest: CES arrives the first week of January, and like a tardy Santa Claus, it bestows the world with the gift of new consumer tech of every kind — phones, cars, TVs, drones, VR — you name it. Looked at another way, CES tends to catapult new devices and technologies at the world like enormous gobs of spaghetti. The thing about spaghetti, though, is not much of it will stick. A large portion of the gadgets, gear and concepts shown at CES will never make it to store shelves, as cool as some of them may be. Still, while many of the devices and gear on display may be suspect on an individual basis, taken in aggregate, they point the way for the industry (and its many sub-industries). CES doesn't create tech trends on its own, but it solidifies existing ones and focuses them by refracting them through a common lens: the consumer. Here are the tech trends to watch out for at CES 2017: Alexa's smart home The rewards of Amazon's early lead in the smart-home war will become apparent at CES 2017 as companies announce several products with Alexa integration. This trend began with last year's show, but after the most high-profile announcement — Samsung's Smart Fridge — turned out be vaporware, things stalled for a while. However, with Nest floundering, Google Home coming late, and other big players like Apple staying more or less silent (HomeKit has surprisingly little buzz in advance of the show), Amazon had no serious challengers, and the partners have come calling. Expect Alexa-powered light bulbs and lamps, loudspeakers, smart locks, sprinklers, and even apps to be all over CES. Yes, Google Home will also get some love, but it'll be a drop in the Alexa bucket. The hottest buzzword: AI CES could fill an encyclopedia with all the jargon that gets thrown around, but there's always one white-hot term that every company wants to include in its sales pitch. In previous years, the crown was worn by "4K," "smart" everything, "4G," and even "satellite radio," but the early winner for CES 2017 looks to be "AI." Artificial intelligence apparently isn't just the domain of the big platform stewards like Facebook and Google — at CES, we'll see that wearables, sensors, cars and more can all be AI-powered. Of course, for many of these products, it'll just be hype. But the ones that can truly deliver a better experience by leveraging the power of AI could change the game for their categories. Cars go beyond driverless Driverless tech and alternative fuels were the big story of last year's show. Although they'll both play a big part at CES 2017 (Faraday Future once again has a big reveal on day one), this year car companies will have to go beyond those now-expected technologies to wow audiences. It looks like they're doing just that — mostly by turning attention to the car's interior. Concept vehicles, imagined for the driverless future, will be on display, as will some driver-centric technologies for the here and now. Think: windshields with heads-up displays (HUDs) and more connected-car gadgets similar to Automatic. Whatever the exact product is, you can bet it'll claim to be AI-powered. Security and privacy: features, not afterthoughts From ransomware to creepy nanny cams, the very public hacks of the past several months have shone a light on the state of security for smart devices — and it looks really bad. In response, a new class of "privacy gadget" has arisen, typically a device that you plug into your home router that promises to safeguard your digital comings and going from prying eyes. For other kinds of devices — especially ones that have anything to do with children — security features will have newfound prominence as well as, hopefully, ease of use. Kid wearables 2016 wasn't a a great year for wearables. There was weak progress from the Big Three (Apple, Google and Samsung), Pebble fell, and fitness mainstays Fitbit and Jawbone began to wither. That won't stop wearable tech from being everywhere at CES 2017, but most of it will be more of the same — poor man's copycats of the big players or single-purpose gadgets with no hope of capturing the mainstream. The one exception is wearables for kids. By their nature, wearables don't require the same expensive tech as other mobile devices (like smartphones), plus the user interfaces are typically very simple. From a tech standpoint, that makes them perfect for children, and the single-purpose idea is a strength in this case: a wearable can help teach a basic skill (step counting is just math, after all) or good habits (like toothbrushing technique). Just as long as they don't forget security (see above). Laptops get big again (for a reason) There are a lot of options for mobile VR (Samsung's Gear VR and Google Daydream View among them), but for a "high end" experience like Oculus or Vive, you'll still need a tricked-out gaming PC. The thing is, not everyone who's into VR wants a big tower on or underneath their desk. Enter the gaming laptop. Gaming laptops have been a thing for a while, but you could probably count the number of them offered out of the box on one hand. At CES, the field will expand dramatically, with graphics-intensive — and VR-ready — PCs debuting from several well-known manufacturers. And since these babies prioritize performance over form factor, they're going to be chunky. VR headsets lose the cords On the other side of the VR coin, it's no secret the industry is working desperately for a high-end VR experience that's truly mobile — which is to say, doesn't tether your head to a PC. Intel has already announced such a device in Project Alloy, and it'll have a big presence at CES. Expect a fistful of smaller companies to vie for a piece of the stand-alone VR action with headsets of their own, though who knows if they'll be able to ship them before Oculus and Vive start selling their solutions. AR: Everyone wants to be Pokémon Go Pokémon Go showed the world the potential of augmented reality, and tech companies have seen its success as a siren call. From devices to gadgets to full-on platforms, everyone with something to contribute to AR will be at CES 2017. Don't expect to actually see the next Pokémon Go — that phenomenon had more to do with the franchise IP than the actual AR experience — but you'll probably see the tech that powers whatever follows in its virtual footsteps. Wireless earbuds everywhere Wireless audio has been with us for a long time, but the last several months have seen the sudden rise of wireless earbuds — earphones with no cords at all, not even one connecting the two sides. It's not a new concept; models like the Bragi Dash were winning CES awards years ago and Sennheiser pioneered the idea back in the day with the MX W1. What's changed is that Apple's AirPods and the ongoing Headphone Jack Saga™ have validated the form factor, not to mention given the category a high price tag. For CES exhibitors, that's the equivalent of blood in the water. TVs: Rise of the Chinese brands CES is traditionally a big TV show — and a show about big TVs — although the room for innovation in the category has gotten very slim. Everything is 4K now, high dynamic range (the hot display tech from CES 2016) is common, and the race for the biggest screen got old a decade ago. Ultra-thin OLED displays can still wow, but they'll be pretty much limited to LG's models. And curved? Please! The story of TVs at CES 2017 won't be the tech as much as who's making it.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Goodbye Google Keyword Planner, Hello Keyword Research Using PPC by David Zimmerman  |   January 3, 2017  |  6,637 views Tweet Kindle Email Top Did you sigh when you heard Google is revoking free full access to its Keyword Planner? Your first reaction was probably like mine: Google is sticking it to SEOs, once again. What are we going to do? Of course, we could invest in a third-party tool. Some of those tools might help fill the gap, but they are expensive and only as good as their sample size. And that got me thinking: If I would have to pay for a keyword research tool anyway, why not use pay-per-click (PPC) advertising for my keyword research? If I create a small PPC campaign, I can get keyword data and several other advantages, too. So, in this article, I will show you how I've done keyword research using Google's Keyword Planner; and, in contrast, what the advantages are of using a small PPC campaign to do keyword research instead. PPC can help me identify new keywords When you use the Keyword Planner (or a third-party keyword tool), you start by brainstorming a list of potential words. Typically, this is what I've done: I brainstorm a list. I will get the client's (or my boss's) input, too. From there I try to think of synonyms for this keyword. Let's say my keyword is "widgets"; they could also be referred to as "doohickeys" or "whatchamacallits." I then try to find words that modify the original keywords. Here, I'm looking for long-tail opportunities. I ask myself, "What kinds of ways would someone want to use what I have to offer?" This could be modifiers like color. It could be solutions like "services" or even "solutions." I might add geographical modifiers, too. A couple of great tools to help identify modifiers are ubersuggest or keyword.io. I try to organize all these on an Excel sheet. Each column contains rows of synonyms. I try to add modifiers in adjacent columns, with mutually exclusive modifiers in each row. I do this so I can take several columns to mergewords.com to assemble these lists into all the possible variations. That's a lot of work. It can take me a couple of hours to do. Even after all that time, I usually find that I've missed a few things. Sometimes, I miss some obvious things. A small PPC campaign could automate that process. All I need to do is try a couple of keywords. Now, contrary to a regular PPC campaign, in our case the broader, the better. Still, I'd start the process with a Modified Broad Match phrase, not Broad Match. The point is to identify possible phrases, so Exact Match wouldn't be particularly useful. Phrase Match could help identify those modifiers I mentioned, but it won't produce the variations we want to see. Once I start to get some clicks on my campaign, I'll get the search queries that accompanied the clicks. These search queries aren't guesses: They are actual phrases potential customers have entered while looking for me or my offering. Sure, it took me longer to get this data from PPC than from the Keyword Planner, but the data is better. PPC can help me compare search terms Now that you know how people are looking for you, you need to know which phrases they use more frequently. Knowing that helps establish your priorities and your opportunities. You could use the Keyword Planner to compare terms against each other. From there you can find whether a potential customer is looking for one phrase more than another. You can also discover how customers are more likely to search for your services. That's not all you want to know, though. Just because people search for a phrase doesn't mean they want what you're offering. And so, for each phrase, I apply a formula to Google's provided search data: Volume x Competition x Estimated CPC = Opportunity (Warning: Some math content to follow.) Again, some people look only at the search volume number. That's limited: Just because a lot of people search for a phrase doesn't mean they are interested in what my company has to offer. I need to know both the number of searches (volume) for a phrase and how competitive it is. I like to think about Google's competition number (a number between 0 and 1) as a percentage: It represents the percentage of searches companies believe are relevant to their services. If a phrase has a competition number of 0.1, I speculate that 10% of those searches are relevant. Likewise, if a phrase has a competition number of 0.9, you might say businesses are interested in 90% of the searches. When I multiply the number of searches and the competition number, I get the number of relevant searches. I also like to consider how many businesses want traffic from a phrase. If companies are willing to pay $5 per click for one phrase but $0.50 a click for another, clearly they want the first more. The theory: if they're paying for it, it must be paying off for then. When I multiply the CPC number with the resulting fraction of relevant searches, I will have combined all these factors together. I call the resulting number the "Opportunity." That's where things get interesting. Take this as an example: In our example, twice as many people are looking for "widgets" than "blue widgets." Since the latter is more competitive and companies are willing to pay twice as much for a click, it has a greater opportunity for me, too. So does "spinning blue widgets": only one-tenth of the search volume, but people are willing to pay three-times as much per click. Don't overlook that opportunity. If you apply this formula to all your terms, you'll see that some phrases with a lot of search volume provide less opportunity than phrases with more CPC. I don't just want clicks; I want customers. Applying the "Volume x Competition x Estimated CPC" formula helps show me where the keyword opportunities exist. Of course, if you've set up a small PPC campaign, you've already got all this information. With each keyword, your PPC campaign will tell you… Impressions. It's important to remember that Impressions and Search Volume represent different things. There will always be more search impressions (number of people searching for your phrase) than people who see your ad. It still serves the same purpose: giving you an idea of which phrase people look for most. Competitiveness. Rather than rely on Google's estimated CPC data, you'll know for sure. In fact, in some small campaigns, you might not be able to bid enough for your ads to show up. If that's the case, you know it's a very competitive phrase. With a small PPC campaign, you'll get all this data without the extra steps you'd need if you were using the Keyword Planner. PPC can help me estimate conversion rates The point of any search campaign, whether PPC or SEO, is more leads—not just more visits. One of the biggest problems with SEO is estimating which phrase will produce those customers. You take a month (or so) to create a landing page, optimize the content, add images, build links (don't forget internal links). Later, you find out that even though you rank No. 1, you aren't getting any new customers from it. (Insert sad trombone sound here.) PPC can more quickly estimate conversion rate. As an added benefit of doing keyword research through your PPC campaign, you'll find out which phrases are more likely to produce leads. Now you know where to put your SEO efforts. In fact, your small PPC campaign could even deliver you leads. Keyword Planner never did that for me! I doubt any third-party tool would make that promise, either. PPC can test your messaging Now that you know the keywords your customers are using, it's time to put them into action. It's time to write the landing page. Ever had a hard time writing a landing page? What should you say? What will convince a customer to use your product or service? Even if you hire good writers, they will need some guidance. This is where keyword research with PPC can be helpful. When you run your campaign, test some ad copy. Which one produces more clicks? Which one produces more conversions? That's the message your potential customers resonate with. Write your landing page accordingly. Keyword research with PPC helps with your messaging; that's something keyword tools simply don't offer. Can you afford keyword research with PPC? You might think you can't afford to use PPC for keyword research, but don't discount the idea. I'm not (necessarily) suggesting that you try a full-force PPC campaign. I spent just $100 over one month (my space is competitive and expensive) and learned the following: What phrases people use to look for me. You know there are a lot of marketing buzzwords out there; I was able to thin those out to only the productive ones. Some great long-tail keywords. I added them to my site. Which keywords produced not only volume but also conversions. What messages resonated with my customers; they weren't what I expected. Now, it wasn't a gangbusters campaign. I didn't become an overnight millionaire. It did produce enough benefit (I grew my email list 20%) that I continued the campaign after the test. In a way, the little campaign paid for itself. Google will always have a love-hate relationship with SEOs. Don't be discouraged. Don't get angry. You can still strike back. You could simply use Bing Ads for your PPC keyword research.

Skip to content SAT Press Releases PR Distribution Menu HOME Submit the press release Our Team & Contact Posted on January 3, 2017January 3, 2017 by Press Release Hyundai Collaborates With Google Assistant In Further Connecting Homes To Cars FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif., Jan. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ — In an integration highlighting the increasing connection between cars and the home, Hyundai is demonstrating compatibility with the company’s Blue Link Agent for the Google Assistant. The integration, which Hyundai will be demonstrating at Pepcom’s Digital Experience prior to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES®) on January 4, allows control of various functions of a Hyundai vehicle with simple voice commands. These commands include “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start my Santa Fe and set the temperature to 72 degrees”, “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to send the address of the Mandarin Oriental, in Las Vegas to my Sonata”, and “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to lock my car”. “Our customers are finding smart home integrations like the one we are showcasing with Google Home to be very useful and convenient,” said Manish Mehrotra, director, digital business planning and connected operations, Hyundai Motor America. “We will continue to add layers of convenience to the Blue Link connected car system and our cars, making features like remote EV charge management, remote locking, temperature and remote start easier than ever while sitting on the couch and saying ‘Ok Google’.” Google Home is a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant that can provide real-time answers, activate streaming music services, smart home devices, and now, cars. Blue Link brings seamless connectivity directly into Hyundai cars with technology like Remote Start with Climate Control, Destination Search powered by Google®, Remote Door Lock/Unlock, Car Finder, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, and Stolen Vehicle Recovery. Blue Link services can be easily accessed from the buttons on the rearview mirror and center stack, the Web or via the Blue Link owners’ smartphone app. In addition to the Action on Google Assistant, some of these features can also be controlled via the latest Android Wear™ and Apple Watch™ smartwatch offerings. How It Works To send commands to the Hyundai Vehicles via the Google Assistant on Google Home, engineers developed a way to link a customer’s Blue Link Account with the Google Assistant voice activated services. Once a customer has successfully linked his or her account, Remote Service commands will only be sent to Hyundai vehicles after the Google Assistant prompts owners for their Blue Link Personal Identification Number (PIN). Examples of Exchanges between Google Home and Hyundai Blue Link Blue Link Action on Google Home demonstration features include: Hyundai will have more features before launching this Action on Google Home into production. HYUNDAI MOTOR AMERICA Hyundai Motor America, headquartered in Fountain Valley, Calif., is a subsidiary of Hyundai Motor Co. of Korea. Hyundai vehicles are distributed throughout the United States by Hyundai Motor America and are sold and serviced through more than 830 dealerships nationwide. All Hyundai vehicles sold in the U.S. are covered by the Hyundai Assurance program, which includes the 5-year/60,000-mile fully transferable new vehicle limited warranty, Hyundai’s 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain limited warranty and five years of complimentary Roadside Assistance. Hyundai Blue Link Connected Care provides owners of Hyundai models equipped with the Blue Link telematics system with proactive safety and car care services complimentary for one year with enrollment. These services include Automatic Collision Notification, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, Vehicle Diagnostic Alert, Monthly Vehicle Health Report and In-Vehicle Service Scheduling.   SOURCE Hyundai Motor America CategoriessatPRnews TagsCO, Devices, Digital, Motor, System Post navigation Previous PostPrevious VOXX International Corporation Sets Date For Its Fiscal 2017 Third Quarter Results And Conference Call Next PostNext Nationwide Class to be Notified about Settlement to Inspect and Replace Up to 1.5 Million Frames on certain Toyota Tacoma, Tundra and Sequoia Vehicles Search Search for: Search Submit the press release now!

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence The Internet of Things has been a key buzz phrase at CES for the past two years. This year CCS believe that the key focus will shift to machine learning and artificial intelligence which will be prominent themes throughout the event. CCS predicts that ‘machine learning will overtake the Internet of things as a hot investment area in 2017’. The huge potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence will see numerous companies focusing on this space at CES. Smart Speakers CCS expects to see a wide range of smart speakers showcased at CES. These will build on the momentum seen in 2016 with the launch of Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home devices. “Success in the smart speaker market will be determined by the software platform, not the hardware,” cautions Martin Garner, Senior Vice President, CCS Insight. The real battleground will be the support for competing voice control systems such as Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana, rather than any hardware differences. CCS believes that smart speakers will kick-start the connected home market in 2017. The arrival of smart assistants like Amazon’s Echo and Google Home are expected to rekindle public interest in connected home devices and there will be a wealth of demonstrations at CES showcasing how consumer control smart thermostats, light bulbs and other devices using the speakers’ intuitive natural language interface. Virtual and Augmented Reality Virtual and augmented realities are poised to be major themes at CES. Companies targeting this opportunity need to build momentum after a slower than anticipated start in 2016. Expect numerous demonstrations at press conferences and on the exhibition floors with dedicated showcases allowing attendees to try out the latest and greatest experiences. While virtual reality has primarily gravitated towards consumer applications, augmented reality is clearly targeting enterprise opportunities. CCS expects a number of announcements in this area from big companies as the technology improves and viable use cases emerge. 360-Degree Cameras In support of the growing momentum around virtual reality and the ease with which 360-degree content can be shared via platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, CCS expects to see an avalanche of 360-degree cameras, particularly from the numerous Shenzhen-based companies attending CES. CCS also expects to see a manufacturer unveil a smartphone with an integrated 360-degree camera. This opportunist move will likely feature a smartphone that has a dual fisheye lens to capture “surroundie” pictures. If such a product appears it has the potential to be a big news story at CES. However, once the dust settles CCS believes it will remain a curiosity in a smartphone market which is still currently characterised by a lack of innovation. Wearables Wearables have been a hot topic at CES over the last couple of years; however CCS Insight’s recently completed wearables survey indicates challenges remain for manufacturers targeting this segment. Full-touch smartwatches still lack a clear purpose and remain a solution looking for a problem. On this basis, CCS believes that there will be a growing number of smart analogue watches on show at CES and those sales of smart analogue watches will outstrip those of Apple and Android-powered devices in 2018 as the appeal of touch-screen smartwatches with full electronic displays wane. Look out for big announcements from leading watchmakers such as Fossil.

On display at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) this week in Las Vegas, the automaker is showcasing how you can control your Hyundai with simple voice commands like, “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start my Santa Fe and set the temperature to 72 degrees,” or “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to send the address of the Mandarin Oriental in Las Vegas to my Sonata,” and “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to lock my car.” “Our customers are finding smart home integrations like the one we are showcasing with Google Home to be very useful and convenient,” said Manish Mehrotra, director of digital business planning and connected operations at Hyundai Motor America. “We will continue to add layers of convenience to the Blue Link connected car system and our cars, making features like remote EV charge management, remote locking, temperature and remote start easier than ever while sitting on the couch and saying ‘Ok Google’.” ALSO SEE: Hyundai Previews Autonomous Future with Self-Driving Ioniq In order for it to work, Hyundai owners would need a Blue Link account, which Google Home connects to in order for it to control the vehicle. Blue Link services can be easily accessed from the web or via the Blue Link owners’ smartphone app. Some functions are even controlled via the latest Android Wear and Apple Watch smartwatch offerings. This is very similar to what Hyundai previously offered with the Amazon Alexa digital assistant, but expanding the functions to owners of the Google Home devices means that more car buyers will have access to these features.

(JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images) BY Kyle Campbell NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Tuesday, January 3, 2017, 11:07 AM After what I can only imagine was a harrowing week without me, I imagine that you’re seriously jonesing for some high-quality automotive news. Well, you, my friends, are in luck. Between all-electric minivans and the latest Google technologies, we’ve got a bunch of news from this week’s electronics showcase in Las Vegas, as well as something special from Kia for next week’s Detroit show. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. ‘LIKE’ US HERE. But first, let’s check in with our president-elect, who has his sights set on yet another of Detroit’s Big Three automakers. Happy New Year and welcome back to the Daily Drive-Thru! GM draws Trump ire for Mexican Cruze production President-elect Trump hasn't taken to kindly to the Mexican-made Chevrolet Cruze Hatchback. (Joanna Tavares) After months of attacking Ford for shifting production of sedans and small cars to Mexico, President-elect Donald Trump finally used his digital bully pulpit to attack General Motors for doing the exact same thing. Trump blasted the Detroit automaker for building Chevrolet Cruze Hatchbacks in Mexico then importing them tax-free for sale in the U.S. In a tweet, Trump demanded that GM, which announced plans to reduced its workforce at the Lordstown, Ohio plant that makes the Cruze compact, either shift production back to the U.S. or face a “big border tax,” a nod to his stated plan to renegotiate or revoke the North American Free Trade Agreement. GM, Ford and other U.S. automakers are gradually moving small car assembly operations to Mexico to counterbalance the weak demand and low profitability of those vehicles made in the U.S. In some cases, the shifts are purportedly to make way for increased production of trucks, SUVs and crossovers, while in other cases, it’s an effort to better serve the growing Latin American market. As for the Cruze, about 52,000 were made in Mexico last year compared to nearly 320,000 in the U.S. Previously, the Cruzes sold in Mexico were made in South Korea.

(FCA US LLC) After facing criticism for its lack of electrified offerings, Chrysler is looking to prove its commitment to zero-emission technology by debuting an all-electric, self-driving minivan this week during the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, in Las Vegas. While Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has no plan to produce the minivan, which comes with a projected single-charge range of 250 miles, it shows that the company is putting a little more emphasis into green technologies. It’s worth noting that Chrysler’s recently redesigned minivan, the Pacifica, features a hybrid version that can achieve up to 33 miles of battery-only driving and is slated to receive Google’s latest self-driving technology. Source: Automotive News Kia to introduce sports sedan in Detroit Kia looks poised to add a high-performance sedan to its steadily expanding lineup during the North American International Auto Show next week. The South Korea-based automaker has released information about the vehicle in dribs and drabs, through a series of short web videos called “The Curve Ahead.” Those videos showcase, among other things, the vehicle’s headlights, roofline and grille. Likely based on the GT4 Stinger, a concept produced by Kia’s Southern California design team for the 2014 Detroit auto show, this yet-to-be-named sedan can hit 60 mph in about 5 seconds, features blind spot detection and has what appears to be a relatively massive panoramic moonroof. During last year’s auto show season, Kia rolled out a full-size sedan in the form of the Cadenza and a new hybrid crossover, the Niro, which is due out for the 2017 model year. By adding a range-topping performance vehicle, the brand is continuing on a strong trajectory. Source: Kia Google, FCA bring new infotainment system to CES Chrysler might be outfitting the 300 with a new Google-integrated infotainment screen, and if it does, it'll probably mirror the one CES attendees will be able to try it out this week.  (FPI Studios) Through its partnership with Google, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles has integrated Android technology into its Uconnect infotainment system to create an all-encompassing control system for media, information services and vehicle comfort. The two companies will show off the system inside a Chrysler 300 sedan during CES. While vehicle automation is the splashiest component of the Google-Fiat Chrysler partnership, the creation of this system—which connects to the vehicle to a litany of programs such as Google Assistant and Google Maps, as well as Android apps such as Pandora, Spotify, NPR one—is far more practical in the short term. The 8.4-inch system uses the latest version of the Android operating system, 7.0 Nougat. CES attendees will get to try the system first-hand. Source: Fiat Chrysler Hyundai will also showcase Google partnership in Vegas Using the Google Assistant on Google Home, owners of Hyundai Ioniq EVs can initiate charging by voice command. (Hyundai) Fiat Chrysler isn’t the only automaker putting Google technology to work. Hyundai owners can now use Google Home to start their cars, set specific climate preferences, program directions and, for those with the electrified Ioniq, commence charging all by the sound of their voices. Hyundai will showcase how the Google Assistant system on Google Home works with its signature Blue Link connectivity system before tomorrow’s CES festivities commence. Google Assistant capabilities, including remote door locking, vehicle location and roadside assistance, can be controlled by the buttons on the rearview mirror and center stack, on the Web or via the Blue Link owners’ smartphone app—some functions can be accessed through smartwatches such as Android Wear and Apple Watch.

By Ross Rubin | January 3, 2017 -- 13:41 GMT (05:41 PST) | Topic: Innovation For Google Assistant, 2017 is a make-or-break year Alphabet and Google began to embrace practicality in 2016 as the two closely related entities changed course on a number of efforts. After many years of teasing its own self-driving car, it chose instead to become a vendor of car technology. But in more pedestrian device pursuits, the company shifted toward going its own way. It took its virtual reality endeavors to the next level with Daydream, took ownership of its vision for Android phones with the Pixel, and threw its weight around the home with its answer to the Amazon Echo and its tripartite router solution Google Wi-Fi. Here are some things Google could do in 2017 to shore up its path. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage Integrate Google Assistant. As I discussed in my column on Apple's new year's resolutions, the home environment allows providers to pick up a different set of requests than in the mobile environment offers. Of course, Amazon.com was first to pursue this approach, but that was driven more by necessity given the company's poor showing in mobile devices. Still, Amazon's head start has made it the first target for voice agent integrations even if many of its device partners are low-volume startups. Google finds itself in a come-from-behind position for voice-activated "skills" just as it was once far behind iOS for mobile apps. This is the year in which Google Assistant must reach out to other apps and devices in order for Google to leverage its advantages in AI. Rationalize Android and Chrome. Apple may never bring together its mobile and desktop operating systems. Over the course of last year, though, Microsoft brought its desktop and mobile operating systems closer together than they've ever been and will extend that integration this year with the re-emergence of Windows on Qualcomm processors. In contrast, Google has spoken vaguely about its "desktop" (Chrome) and "mobile" (Android) operating systems converging essentially since Chrome was launched, the closest we have come has been the nominal support of Google Play (with many incompatible apps) on Chrome. For Google to step up and become a more serious challenger to Windows beyond the education market, a converged operating system such as the rumored "Andromeda" would need to offer the kind of productivity amenities that Mac and Windows users take for granted (or at least address apps that are cranky about landscape orientation). Attack TV, Take 3. In my column on Apple's new year's resolutions, I mentioned that Apple had shored up its ecosystem with software updates to Apple Watch and Apple TV. Google, on the other hand, greatly expanded the potential audience for Android Auto by making the driving interface yet another app. The company also showed off a now-delayed update for Android Wear in 2016. However, TV continues to be a weak area for Google. YouTube may reign in short-form video and the Chromecast may be an effective cheap option for getting smartphone video to the big screen, but Android TV has only marginally eclipsed its disastrous predecessor Google TV. Sony has held on as the only major TV company committed to the platform while add-on boxes such as the Nexus Player and NVIDIA Shield have faded as Google steps away from the Nexus model and NVIDIA departs consumer devices. If Google continues its 2016 ways, an enhanced Chromecast could offer support apps (or at least Roku-like channels) or could see a companion product in a Google-developed "Pixel TV" device that would bring Google back into the TV platform conversation.

Dong Ngo/CNET If the Google Wifi competes with the Eero by being much less expensive, Belkin's first Wi-Fi system, the Linksys Velop, intends to beat them both by having more powerful hardware. This new system, released today at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, carries the same hefty price as that of the Eero at launch: $500 for a set of three identical units or $200 for a single unit (you can also get two for $350.) That price converts to about £405 or AU$685 for the set of three, £160 or AU$275 for a single unit or two for £285 or AU$480. So it doesn't come cheap. But it packs enough power to potentially double the real-world Wi-Fi speed. Powerful hardware with dedicated back-haul Like most Wi-Fi systems, you use one Velop unit as the main router, then place additional units around it - one or two rooms away - to wirelessly and automatically extend the Wi-Fi network. Each Velop unit is a powerful tri-band dual-stream (2x2) AC2200 router, compared to the AC1200 Wi-Fi standard used by both Google Wifi and the Eero. It has two 5GHz bands with up to 867 megabits per second each and one 2.4GHz band (up to 400Mbps). The router is powered by an integrated system on a chip that incorporates a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor along with 4GB of flash memory, 512MB DDR3 system memory and a Bluetooth 4.0/LE radio for device setup. That's a lot of raw power. What special about the Velop is that when multiple units are used together, they dedicate one 5GHz band for the back-haul, or the job of wirelessly linking them together. In other words, the main router unit uses one band just to send the signal to a satellite unit, and the satellite uses one of its 5GHz band just for the job of receiving that signal. Then it uses the other two bands to rebroadcast the signal to clients. This minimizes the effect of signal loss, which always occurs when a band has to both receive and rebroadcast the Wi-Fi signal at the same time. The Velop is the second Wi-Fi system, the Netgear Orbi being the first, that employs a dedicated back-half band. But the Velop goes one step further than the Orbi by supporting dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allowing it to automatically pick the best channel or band at a given time to connect the hardware units and clients together. You can also link the Velop units together using network cables, which will completely eliminate signal loss and distance restriction -- something the Netgear Orbi so far hasn't allowed. All these mean one thing: fast Wi-Fi connection speed. Basically the Velop is fast enough to deliver ultra-fast internet connection of 400Mbps or even faster. Keep in mind that most existing Wi-Fi systems, like the Eero or Google Wifi, can deliver the full broadband speed of no more than 200Mbps. Each Velop unit is a powerful AC2200 router that has two auto-sensing (LAN/WAN) Gigabit network ports. Dong Ngo/CNET Feature packed The Velop comes with a Linksys app for iOS and Android for both the setup process and ongoing management. It also comes with a host of cool features, including: Spot Finder: Using the Linksys app, the Velop will recommend the best placement for additional satellite units to deliver the best performance. Linksys XConnect: Sensitive information, such as passwords, will be encrypted and secure when passed between hardware units. Amazon Alexa Cloud Integration: You can use Alexa to control your home network, turn the Guest nerwork on and off or verbally request the Wi-Fi networks' passwords. Future Alexa skills are in development. Seamless Wi-Fi Experience: Velop promises seamless signal hand-off, allowing a connected client to roam from one hardware unit to another without interruption. Airtime fairness, Load balancing and device steering: When multiple clients with different Wi-Fi speed grades are connected to the Velop, they are treated differently based on their top speed. This allows all devices to connect at their best speeds. Wi-Fi coverage and availability Linksys says you can use a single Velop unit to cover a home of some 2,000 square feet, two units for up to 4,000 square feet and all three units for up to 6,000 square feet. The actual coverage depends on the layout of your home, obviously, but chances are you won't need more than three units. The Velop is available now and includes a three-year warranty, which is generous considering most routers and Wi-Fi systems come with just one year. All things considering this Wi-Fi system sure sounds promising. Check back after CES for the full review to see how its real-world performance pans out. Here's what else is happening at CES 2017.

I’m currently in my second year of grad school, so I definitely understand the craziness of student life. During my undergrad I tried all sorts of unsustainable ways to balance my time between three part-time jobs, classes, and a school sports team. One day I caught myself waterproofing my notes so that I could study in the shower, and realized that there had to be a better way to use my time. Thankfully, there is (which is good news because shower studying isn’t effective)! The strategies in this article may not add hours to your day, but you’ll be able to use the time you have more efficiently. Seriously, it’s been years since my last all-nighter, I’ve kept both a high GPA and my job at MakeUseOf, and I’ve had lots of time for fun (and sleep). Finding more time for school isn’t impossible, it just takes a little bit of work. Start Your Morning Off Right Whether or not you’re a morning person, it’s important to start your day off on the right foot! Ads by Google Listen to Your Alarm Getting a couple tasks done first thing in the morning sets the rest of your day up for success. You don’t need to become a morning person, but try to avoid hitting snooze or forgetting to set an alarm entirely. If you struggle to listen to your normal alarm clock, there are great alarm apps The 10 Best Alarm Clock Apps for Android in 2016 The 10 Best Alarm Clock Apps for Android in 2016 Having a solid alarm clock app is important if you want to wake up on time. Try out one of these. Read More out there that might be a better fit. Don’t Get Stuck on Social Media Once you wake up, it’s easy to stay in bed aimlessly switching between Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter on your phone. This can eat up tons of your time in the morning, and is a huge drain on your productivity. Try one of these options to break this habit: Put your phone or computer across the room from your bed. And once you’re up, don’t go back under the covers! Set a second alarm for when you need to stop checking social media. Only check your notifications before getting out of bed, and don’t scroll through any newsfeeds. Set limits on your phone use through an app like Moment, (OffTime), or AppDetox. Know What’s Going On Okay, you’re out of bed. Now what? Take five minutes to look at your calendar and to figure out your plan for the day. Staying on top of your assignments and having a semester-based plan for how you will tackle them is key for productivity. Many people like to set this up individually using their existing calendar client or a paper-based planner. However, there are also great apps specifically designed for students like StudyCal and iStudiez. In addition to normal calendar functions you can also track your grades, set assignment reminders, and organize key course information. Make Your Time at School Count If you’re like most students, you spend a lot of time on campus! Take advantage of breaks between or during classes to get some work done instead of wasting time on social media or Netflix. In Class While you’re in class, these tips and tools can help you use your time effectively: Go to class. I know that sometimes professors are boring, or that you think you can learn more on your own. The fact of the matter is that if you go to class and focus while you’re there, you’ll save a lot of time when you’re studying for exams. Take good notes. If you’re sitting in lecture absently staring at a slideshow, of course you aren’t going to absorb any information! Use a multi-purpose note-taking app like Notability, Microsoft OneNote, or Evernote to capture detailed notes How to Use OneNote at School: 10 Tips for Students & Teachers How to Use OneNote at School: 10 Tips for Students & Teachers OneNote can transform the modern classroom. The note-taking app from Microsoft is designed for both students and teachers. Go ahead and organize, collaborate, and share with these tips for better note-taking. Read More  on any device. Distract yourself productively. Sometimes it’s truly impossible to focus in class. But, instead of doing some online shopping or going on Facebook, try to do something productive instead. This could mean doing research for a paper in the course, reviewing project outlines, or doing course readings. Between Classes No matter how perfect your schedule is, you likely have a few awkward breaks throughout your day. It’s important to take some time to eat, go for a walk, and clear your head. However, you can also get a lot of small tasks out of the way without increasing your stress level How To Beat Stress By Staying Ahead of it How To Beat Stress By Staying Ahead of it No one likes being stressed. That feeling of knowing that you need to get something done, or that something bad might happen is terrible. Read More ! Keep a running to-do list of five-minute tasks that you can work on throughout your day. This list can be on paper, on your phone’s native note app, or on a specific to-do list app like Wunderlist. Tasks could be sending an email, editing a page of an assignment, or completing three homework problems. In addition, your options increase if you use a cloud-based program like Google Drive 7 New Google Drive Features Every Student Must Know 7 New Google Drive Features Every Student Must Know School is in session and Google is ready to make things easier for students with Google Drive. New features have been introduced and old ones refined. We have the details. Read More for your ongoing projects and assignments. If you save documents and slideshows to the cloud, you can access them from any device — meaning that you can make changes from a campus computer or your phone in a pinch! If you have longer breaks during your school days, do you have time to accomplish a larger task? You could use this time for a trip to the campus gym, a meeting with a professor, or a coffee date with a friend. Avoid the After School Slump It’s so easy to come home from class and fall into a food and Netflix haze until it’s time for bed. A few quick techniques can keep you focused and working hard (after a quick snack, of course). Have a Plan Remember your calendar from earlier in the day? Time to check back in! Figure out exactly what you want to accomplish each day. Having a purpose (and an end point) is very important for prioritizing tasks, staying focused, and getting started. It’s also a great idea to schedule in study time for specific events. For example, if you have a quiz every Wednesday, block off time every Tuesday to study specifically for that quiz. Limit Your Distractions It would be wonderful if all students had superhuman self control Self-Control IS Possible: Learn How With These 10 YouTube Videos Self-Control IS Possible: Learn How With These 10 YouTube Videos Learn all about self-control with the help of these expert YouTube videos. Improve your own ability to focus and make good choices. Read More . Until that’s a reality, thankfully there are apps that can act as substitutes. Programs like SelfControl, Focus, or StayFocused can help you to block or limit access to specific websites or the internet overall. Hardcore users may block the internet for a couple hours, but sometimes it’s enough to block sites for fifteen minutes while you write the first paragraph of an essay! Try the Pomodoro Technique One of the best ways to get work done effectively is to follow the Pomodoro technique Add Pomodoro Timers to Your To-Do Lists With This App Add Pomodoro Timers to Your To-Do Lists With This App The Pomodoro technique is one the most effective ways to boost productivity, and this app can integrate Pomodoro timers right into your to-do lists! Read More . Basically, you stay focused for 25 minutes, and then receive a five-minute break. This cycle is repeated four times, after which you can take a longer break. If an idea pops into your head during one of your work sessions, you quickly jot it down on a piece of paper, and then return to your task at hand.  Following this kind of time management strategy is a great way to stay focused, while still rewarding yourself for a job well done! Finish Strong At the end of the day, you likely just want to crawl into bed and block out the world. But, taking ten minutes to set yourself up for tomorrow can make a world of difference. Pack Your Bag Make getting ready to head out the door in the morning part of your before-bed routine. Gather together everything you’ll need for tomorrow’s classes, your lunch, and your outfit. Having everything in a set location will make tomorrow morning much more streamlined and stress-free. As well, it makes it far less likely that you’ll forget to print out your paper or grab your bus pass on your way out the door! Go to Bed on Time It may seem counter-intuitive to get more sleep when you are stressed. After all, it’s our inclination as students to stay up late whenever possible in order to get work done! However, sleep is more important than most people realize and can have a huge influence on how well you function the next day. By making sleep a priority 7 Secrets to Sleep Peacefully, According to Science 7 Secrets to Sleep Peacefully, According to Science A perfect night's sleep is not as difficult as you might think. We've compiled this list of ten science-based tips and tricks for helping you fall asleep. Read More you allow your brain to consolidate what it has learned throughout the day, which then cuts down on studying time! In addition, regularly getting a good night’s sleep helps your immune system, your concentration, your memory, and your attention span — all of which are pretty key for success at school. Use Your Weekends Wisely It’s so tempting to think of weekends as an escape from the realities of school. Unfortunately, ignoring the stressors of school during the weekend can just make everything worse on Monday morning. These simple tasks can make a world of difference in how much time you have to study during the week. Do Some Meal Prep If you live off-campus, you likely don’t realize how much time you spend in the kitchen each day! Many students can easily spend over an hour on meal preparation each day — an hour they could use for studying or other tasks. Consider planning out your food for the week Automatically Plan Your Meals & Make Dieting Easier With Eat This Much Automatically Plan Your Meals & Make Dieting Easier With Eat This Much One of the reasons for struggling with diets is the amount of work it takes organizing a diet that will help make you slim and healthy while providing some respite from the continual grind of... Read More . Then, make two or three large meals over the weekend and portion them out into tupperware containers in your fridge. Throughout the week, you can just pop them in the microwave, meaning that meal prep suddenly only takes a few minutes! Crockpot meals are another great way to save time in the kitchen. If you don’t enjoy cooking, you can still save some time by grocery shopping on the weekend, portioning out some pre-made snacks, or pre-planning where you will get each of your meals through the week. Accomplish One Large Task Each weekend, ask yourself which of your upcoming homework tasks “future you” will wish you accomplished over the weekend. Then, try and conquer that task (or a big part of it). By attacking one of your most dreaded to-do list items over the weekend (when you are less stressed), you’ll be a lot less apprehensive on Sunday night. Take a Break Seriously. No one is an effective student if they’re constantly stressed. Take some time off 9 Unique Ways for You to Recharge with a Break Now 9 Unique Ways for You to Recharge with a Break Now The human mind is not meant to work continuosly.

Finding More Hours in the Day No matter what, school is going to be hard. There are a lot of people expecting a lot from you, and it’s a definite learning curve trying to figure out how to prioritize, organize, and complete all of the work that’s assigned! What are your best strategies for finding time for schoolwork during the day? Let me know in the comments! I still have one semester left and lots of room for improvement.

This Song Can Reduce Anxiety by 65% 1 comment Write a Comment Lazza January 10, 2017 at 11:27 pm Nice post! I successfully finished my MSc about a year ago and I recognized that some of the tips there are actually what I did more or less naturally (especially the go to class part which is ESSENTIAL to get good results). The thing about waterproof notes really made me laugh though. :D There are nevertheless some points that I don't completely agree with. This might be due to a different background (I'm Italian and I studied in Italy, Denmark and the Netherlands... I have no idea how college or university could be in North America) or just different taste. For instance, I am a very satisfied Evernote user myself (Premium account) and I used it a lot to research information and collect snippets of web pages. I've done group work with it in some cases, as well. Nevertheless, I would never have though of using an app to take notes in class. Really. Writing on paper is way better, especially if you do it tidy. Let me explain why: slowness. Yes, taking notes on paper will make you slow (compared to typing). Even more so if you take the time to really write tidy notes (messy notes are easy and quick to take), however this is a plus: if you write slow then you must write concisely to keep the pace of your teacher. Presto! You get to summarize information "for free", without spending extra time. The tidier your notes, the more summarized the information. Plus, you won't need to rewrite them in clean copy (I hope this is the correct term). Your drafts are going to be the final revision of your notes (or almost there)!!! Not to mention that you can easily draw plots and graphs on paper. Try "typing" a drawing into Evernote while the teacher is talking. ASCII art is neat but it requires effort. ;) Regarding the preparation of meals during the weekend, it is indeed a good idea and some people will make use of it. I personally preferred to actually spend that hour for cooking though. I used to think that cooking was the right way of taking a break (see what you wrote a bit later), especially with a bit of music from time to time. It really helped me relax for an hour, so I could resume studying immediately after eating. Finally, I think you missed the most important and simple tip (not really related to saving time, but surely to be a more productive student): ask questions. :) Always do that. Some students think they look dumb if they ask, but this is actually not the case. I've always been the one with high grades yet I was the one who was asking more questions during the lectures. I never thought "they will think I am a fool if I ask" but more like "I will be a fool if I don't understand this point before the exam day comes, so I need to ask".

Artificial intelligence matters, but distribution, developers, and integration may matter more. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 3, 2017 -- 15:13 GMT (07:13 PST) | Topic: CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business Amazon's Alexa is the brain of its Echo and digital assistant efforts, and the company is rapidly beginning to distribute the technology into other products. CES 2017 The best mobile tech, PCs and laptops on display Panasonic unveils 'human-like' companion robot Kingston unveils 'world's highest capacity USB flash drive' Voice is the next computer interface Dell's killer new XPS 13 2-in-1 HP shows new business convertible and Sprout Pro Amazon revs Alexa everywhere strategy Under Armour highlights digital transformation efforts See also: CNET's full coverage At the Consumer Electronics Show 2017, it's clear that Amazon aims to put Alexa everywhere. Google will also look to embed its Google Assistant everywhere too -- in Hyundai cars for instance -- but Amazon is quickly forging pacts with big-name tech vendors. Consider: DISH will enable Amazon Alexa voice control on its Hopper DVR. According to a statement, DISH is the first TV provider to offer direct compatibility with Alexa. Whirlpool connecting Alexa to its smart appliances as a skill on Echo and Echo Dot. Given Alexa's integration with other smart home providers, Amazon is becoming intertwined with in-home connectivity. Lenovo is also integrating Amazon's Alexa in a series of smart devices. What's interesting here is that Lenovo sees Amazon as more of a partner than competitor, even as it preps its own artificial intelligence technology. Amazon is ensuring Alexa will have the developer community behind it via integration with Amazon Web Services. CNET: What's Alexa up to at CES? Here's a running list including integration with GE and Samsung. On the strategy front, Amazon's strategy with Alexa rhymes with what we've seen from Netflix and Microsoft in the past. Netflix dropped allegiance to hardware and partnered with multiple vendors to distribute its service. Microsoft's Windows operating system wasn't the best game in town in the early days of the PC market, but gained distribution to become a standard. TechRepublic: Amazon Alexa is stepping into home security automation with ADT Amazon sees similar success ahead. We can debate all day whether Alexa is really that smart relative to Google Assistant, Cortana, and Siri. But that bake-off may not matter. History shows distribution can trump all as long as a technology is good enough.

The airline industry has just come off of a four-year winning streak of profits powered by controlled expenses and lower fuel prices. Some airlines have taken the opportunity to re-make themselves. Others have been quite happy to take the profits and store them up for the rainy day when the good times end. 2017 will be a challenging year. Fuel costs are on the rise. Labour costs are on the rise. Technology platforms have not come down in price. Surprisingly the airline industry still spends less as a category of their revenues in technology that other industries. So here are my thoughts on 2017. In the near-term, the New Distribution Capability (NDC) is finally gaining traction, with 90 airlines expecting to use it by 2020. Despite all of the challenges, its utility is now spreading beyond the use as a distribution tool. Ancillaries are starting to move mainstream. But challenges remain. The core passenger service system (PSSs) and global distribution systems (GDSs) have not changed in their limited abilities to provide modern digital selling platforms. This fact still haunts the whole industry with legacy challenges. Airlines — particularly the full-service network carriers — are still stuck in their mode of protecting their complex (and fragile!) technology platforms. Low-cost carriers (LCCs) often have better and more flexible platforms, albeit at mostly a lower scale. Admittedly, the lines between the definitions of each model have become blurred. The majority of network carriers either have paid ancillaries or are planning to introduce them. Many LCCs are now looking to participate in the global distribution networks. Against this backdrop, how can technology provide winning answers? Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and deep learning will start to find their way into technology platforms. Previously there were some minor uses of these technologies in analyzing massive data sets that the airlines have. What’s new is the emergence of lower-cost services and the ability to integrate these into real-time solutions. Expect chatbots (both speech and text) to emerge in many areas of airlines for customer service and offer interaction. We can expect consumers to be able to see relevant offers in a far more friendlier (conversational) fashion. Expect the importance of the consumer platforms and the cost of interacting with them to become more of an issue that’s front-and-centre for the airlines. This change of mindset will be technology-driven. Airlines are going to become unhappy with their technology platforms when those platforms are proven to NOT be agile enough to engage fully with the likes of Facebook, Google, and other gatekeepers. One challenge that will emerge for airlines will be the realization that there has been a concentration of power in the intermediary marketplace. This will cause them to consider how much value the GDSs will provide when ~80% or more of their indirect business is going via four or five global travel management companies and just two leisure channels. But airlines will worry about the cost of interacting with the leading metasearch companies that deliver the most air ticket conversions, given that Ctrip’s Skyscanner acquisition means they are all loosely inside the same family. The airlines have struggled and failed to establish viable alternative channels of distribution. Just because the GDS channel can look to be cheaper than say Google or Kayak doesn’t make it any the less palatable for the supply chain. Just because the GDSs keep repeating that “Google is bad so therefore we are good in comparison” doesn’t make it so. (See “Are GDSs fit for purpose? A checklist“) Another trend I foresee is the escalating cost of maintaining interfaces to the traditional platforms. The challenges come from several directions: The cost for the airlines of being able to maintain concurrency and control via the GDSs which need pre-filed fares. The increasing cost of the user community to maintain the interfaces to legacy technology forms PLUS the cost of migrating to newer forms of interface is perplexing. The lack of simplistic ways to distribute any product to any channel in real-time is going to weigh heavier on the airlines next year. In the past the focus was on the commercial constraints. Increasingly it will be on the operational and technology costs and the attendant constraints. Look for alternative solutions to emerge that solve in whole or in part this challenge. The challenge of mobile is that, while apps can do more, the market is well and truly saturated with them. Getting an app onto a customer’s mobile device is now, in general, prohibitively expensive and almost useless as the lack of frequency of use makes it redundant. Consumers typically have between 27-30 apps they use on a regular basis and they spend a lot of time on them each month – nearly 40 hours. However travel-based apps hardly figure in any of the usage figures. One way is to engage with a frequently-used service. This is how ClearTrip in India has increased its “brandshare” of app usage. Expect other platforms to follow this lead, with Expedia and Google jumping in already. Airbnb and Uber are already there and this is going to put further pressure on the traditional brands. Rome2Rio is making real money. TripAdvisor is experimenting with activities and restaurants to boost usage. Priceline will likely bring OpenTable into their other brands, boosting repeat and local resident usage. The industry will watch if Hopper fulfills its 2017 promises. Mobile is also powering a move into non-traditional outlets. Several Chinese airlines participated in Singles Day (11/11) and some have privately reported record sales through non-traditional outlets. We can expect to see more of this type of activity in the coming years as Singles Day-type events such as Black Friday spread throughout the world. From a pure technical perspective the use of responsive and adaptive web technologies has not made the interaction work well. To this end I am predicting that the next generation of PWA – Progressive Web Apps to make a big mark and be able to merge the environments between mobile and large-format systems. The very high cost of maintaining apps and websites separately and the dearth of reasonable tools has made this proposition very attractive. Google is making this very easy. I also see that the use of component applets (often called widgets) will also make the re-use of code and its management a lot easier. Application programming interfaces (APIs) will continue to come into view. For a selection of good APIs, go to Mashery and search for big name airlines like British Airways, Lufthansa, and IATA. (Startups are using free APIs from Skyscanner for Business and others.) Integrating APIs into a variety of applications will be a trend that emerges,  but it will take time. Airlines will still struggle with the concept of open access to their precious products. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from different industries. Sometimes I think the industry players such as airlines and GDSs just need to get over themselves! One area I am tracking very closely is financial fulfillment and settlement. The current systems are both expensive and also difficult to use. Newer systems are enabling lower costs (for airlines the cost of credit-card processing is within the top three expense items). We are seeing a number of next-generation payment systems emerge which can challenge the traditional players. Some are even creating their own vehicles. Allied with this is the whole area of security. I still maintain that payment card industry (PCI) compliance is a giant joke inflicted on all industries. I believe that blockchain will be the technology to watch that can improve security of the transactions. Bitcoin as a form of payment is still too scary but the technology behind it is well worthy of further looks as a way to secure the sensitive and complex transactions in travel. Finally the area of consumer data and privacy will become a hotter topic in 2017. Within Vaultpad we have created solutions that let us store customer data in “places” commensurate with the users country of origin regulations. This will become an increasingly complex challenge to deal with. So there you have it. I hope you have a safe and prosperous 2017. Look out for some of these trends and let me know if you think I am right or if I get it wrong.

I have to say this is an excellent and thoughtful piece, as will as Mr. O’Neill-Dunne’s from last November which I was only able to catch up to now. I think the payment card industry rules, and customer data mentioned at the end might be the “sleeper” issues of the lot. Cheers. Reply 2 weeks ago   Alan Walker Perhaps the airlines could go to an open-source model to take back control of distribution. This might be done as a separate foundation, or within an alliance, etc. For example, if they all distribute via NDC, could a travel agent download a desktop app that lets them bypass the GDS and get to all the new, juicy content? The immediate push-back against open source is that they’re giving away their “secret sauce”, but the reality of the PSS is that the vast majority of the code simply follows standards and does pretty much the same thing for every airline. If it’s built as a collection of components / micro-services, then airlines could share this code.

"Following" : "Follow"}} January 03, 2017 10:07am   Comments Share: Related AMZN Greek Philosophy, Tough Guys, And Rubber Necking Recode: Amazon Poached Target Exec Who Was Tasked With Beating Amazon The Vetr community has downgraded $AMZN to 3-Stars (Vetr) Related BABA The Market In 5 Minutes: Big Banks Get Earnings Season Started Wall Street's M&A Chatter From January 12 Trump Inauguration, Netflix, GE, IBM, Davos Lead Investing Action Plan (Investor's Business Daily) 2017 is just three days old, yet analysts at RBC Capital Markets have already published a yearly outlook for internet stocks. RBC's Mark Mahaney published a list of 10 potential surprises internet investors should be aware of. Although the analyst acknowledged that these events are "highly improbable," there is at least a 30 percent chance of them occurring. 1. Trump Administration Despite President-elect Donald Trump's harsh rhetoric on internet stocks, especially Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Mahaney believes no action will be taken. Amazon is one of the biggest employers in the country and undermining the internet giant "may not help make America great again." On the other hand, Trump's low-tax and low-regulation thinking will actually be very positive for the internet sector as a whole. 2. FANG Remains A Winner The popularized "FANG" trade — an acronym to group together some of the leading internet stocks including Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB), Amazon, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Google/Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) — is likely to outperform the market in 2017. The analyst cited the sustainability of Alphabet and Facebook's top-line growth; operating expenditure discipline at Amazon, Alphabet and Facebook; and accelerated subscriber additions at Netflix. 3. Facebook Expands To China Mahaney noted that Facebook's expansion into the Chinese market was part of his 2016 prediction, but this didn't happen. This year, it could happen because "stranger things have happened." Facebook is developing software that could be used to suppress controversial posts — an absolute must to operate in the highly censored Chinese market. 4. Alphabet's 'Other Bets' Pay Off Alphabet's "Other Bets" business consists of essentially all projects that aren't part of the company's core offerings. The analyst believes certain products in the unit, such as Nest, home automation and a self-driving car could surprise the market with key milestones. 5. Amazon's Investment Cycle No Longer A Big Worry Amazon continues to heavily invest in key categories and growth initiatives, including Original Video Content, India and physical capacity. The analyst believes the company has now reached a "point of scale" in which it can make these investments and simultaneously expanding margins. 6. Netflix Continues To Grow The Street is modeling Netflix to add 4.3 million net new subscribers in the United States and 12.5 million net new subscribers internationally this year. Mahaney noted that Netflix could surprise the Street and achieve or beat these figures due to more original content launches, integration with cable providers and a more extensive international expansion compared to last year. 7. The Street's Outlook On Twitter Consensus estimates are calling for Twitter Inc (NYSE: TWTR) to grow its revenue by 10 percent this year. However, the analyst believes a 5 percent growth is a more appropriate forecast, and even so, this figure may need to be reduced throughout the year. 8. Alibaba Makes A Major Expansion Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA) or another major Chinese internet company will look beyond expanding in Southeast Asia and target a Western country for a major launch. One possible option on the table would be to expand through an acquisition of eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY). 9. Yelp Finds A Buyer Mahaney has been making the case for Yelp Inc (NYSE: YELP) to be acquired for quite some time. The company's platform consists of three million local businesses, 135,000 paying local advertisers and over 100 million global unique visitors is attractive for a strategic acquirer. 10. TV Advertising The topic of linear TV being bought in automated fashion could be a big trend in 2017. Companies such as Trade Desk have been investing in this kind of technology for a few years and now is the time to bring many of the efficiencies of the internet to the largest media platform in the United States.

The company confirmed late last year its Xperia X smartphone would be the latest to get support for Sony’s Concept build of Android. Sony Xperia X is now the first smartphone besides the Nexus and Google Pixel devices to get the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update. Android 7.1.1 Nougat MR1 for the Sony Xperia X reportedly carries build number 38.3.A.0.41 and feature several improvements and tweaks such as faster startup for the camera app, a restart button that comes up after the power button is held down, and the December Security Patch. Reports also suggest that Sony has added PlayStation 4 Remote Play functionality to this version of Nougat. Bear in mind though that Sony hasn’t sent out this release to all owners of the Xperia X. Those who are based in Europe can get their handsets on Android 7.1.1 Nougat for Xperia X right now by downloading the company’s Concept Installer app from the Play Store. It remains to be seen when Sony publicly releases this build of its Nougat update. Samsung may join the list later this month when it releases Android 7.1.1 for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media SEJ SUMMIT Tools Advertise 10 Reasons Your Website Can Have a High Bounce Rate SEO January 3, 2017 SEO Amelia WillsonJanuary 3, 2017 1.5KSHARES 4.3KREADS 1.5KSHARES 4.3KREADS Amelia Willson 1.5KSHARES 4.3KREADS The dreaded high bounce rate. It makes the shoulders of online marketers tense up, and causes their foreheads to wrinkle up with concern. Wait, What’s Bounce Rate Again? As a refresher, bounce rate refers to the percentage of visitors that leave your website (or “bounce” back to the search results or referring website) after viewing only one page on your site. Before you start worrying, consider that “high” is a relative term. According to a RocketFuel study, most websites will see bounce rates between 26% to 70%. Based on the data they gathered, they provided a bounce rate grading system of sorts: 25% or lower: Something is probably broken 26-40%: Excellent 41-55%: Average 56-70%: Higher than normal, but could make sense depending on the website 70% or higher: Bad and/or something is probably broken The overall bounce rate for your site will live in the Audience Overview tab of Google Analytics. You can find your bounce rate for individual channels and pages in the behavior column of most views in Google Analytics. There are a number of reasons your website can have a high bounce rate. Let’s review ten common ones and how to fix them. 1. Slow-to-Load Page Google has long indicated that site speed is included in their ranking algorithm, so as a good SEO you should be focused on it anyway. Google wants to promote content that provides a positive experience for users, and they recognize that a slow site provides a poor experience. If your page takes longer than a few seconds to load, your visitors may get fed up and leave. Fixing site speed is a lifelong journey for most SEOs and webmasters, but the upside is that with each incremental fix, you should see an incremental boost in speed. Review your page speed (overall and for individual pages) using tools like Google PageSpeed Insights, Pingdom, and GTMetrix. They’ll offer you recommendations specific to your site, such as compressing your images, reducing third-party scripts, and leveraging browser caching. 2. Self-Sufficient Content In some cases, the user will get everything they were looking for from the page on your site. This can be a wonderful thing—perhaps you’ve achieved the content marketer’s dream and created the kind of 10X content that wholly consumed them for a handful of minutes in their lives! Or perhaps you have a landing page that only requires the user to complete a short lead form. To determine whether bounce rate is nothing to worry about, you’ll want to look at the Time Spent on Page and Average Session Duration metrics in Google Analytics. If the user is spending a couple of minutes or more on the page, that sends a positive signal to Google that they found your page highly relevant to their search query. If you want to rank for that particular search query, that kind of user intent is gold. If the user is spending less than a minute on the page (which may be the case of a properly optimized landing page with a quick-hit CTA form), consider enticing the reader to read some of your related blog posts after filling out the form. 3. Disproportional Contribution by a Few Pages If we expand on the example from the previous section, you may have a few pages on your site that are contributing disproportionally to the overall bounce rate for your site. Google is savvy at recognizing the difference between these. So if your single CTA landing pages reasonably satisfy user intent and cause them to bounce quickly after taking action, but your longer-form content pages have a lower bounce rate, you’re probably good to go. However, you will want to dig in and confirm that this is the case or discover if some of these pages with a higher bounce rate shouldn’t be causing users to leave en masse. Open up Google Analytics, go to Behavior > Site Content > Landing Pages, and sort by Bounce Rate. Consider adding an advanced filter to remove pages that might skew the results. For example, it’s not necessarily helpful to agonize over the one Twitter share with 5 visits that has all your social UTM parameters tacked onto the end of the URL. My rule of thumb is to determine a minimum threshold of volume that is significant for the page. Choose what makes sense for your site, whether it’s 100 visits or 1,000 visits, then click on Advanced and filter for Sessions greater than that. 4. Misleading Title Tag and/or Meta Description Ask yourself: Is the content of your page accurately summarized by your title tag and meta description? If not, visitors may enter your site thinking your content is about one thing, only to find that it isn’t, and then bounce back to whence they came. Whether it was an innocent mistake or you were trying to game the system by optimizing for keyword clickbait (shame on you!), this is, fortunately, simple enough to fix. Either review the content of your page and adjust the title tag and meta description accordingly or rewrite the content to address the search queries you really want to attract visitors for. 5. Blank Page or Technical Error If your bounce rate is exceptionally high and you see that people are spending less than a few seconds on the page, it’s likely your page is blank, returning a 404, or otherwise not loading properly. Take a look at the page from your audience’s most popular browser and device configurations (e.g. Safari on desktop and mobile, Chrome on mobile, etc.) to replicate their experience. You can also check in Search Console under Crawl > Crawl Errors to discover the issue from Google’s perspective. Correct the issue yourself or talk to someone who can—an issue like this can cause Google to drop your page from the search results in a hurry. 6. Bad Backlink from Another Website It’s possible you could be doing everything perfect on your end to achieve a normal or low bounce rate from organic search results, and still have a high bounce rate from your referral traffic. The referring site could be sending you unqualified visitors or the anchor text and context for the link could be misleading. Sometimes this is a result of sloppy copywriting. The writer or publisher linked to your site in the wrong part of the copy, or didn’t mean to link to your site at all. Start by reaching out to the author of the article, then the editor or webmaster if the author doesn’t have the ability to update post-publish. Plead your case and politely ask them to remove the link to your site or update the context, whichever makes sense. Pro tip: you can easily find their contact information with this awesome guide by Joshua Daniels. Unfortunately, the referring website may be trying to sabotage you with some blackhat SEO tactics, out of spite or just for fun. For example, they may have linked to your Guide to Adopting a Puppy with the anchor text of FREE GET RICH QUICK SCHEME. You should still reach out and politely ask them to remove the link, but if needed, you’ll want to update your disavow file in Search Console. Disavowing the link won’t reduce your bounce rate, but it will tell Google not to take that site’s backlink into account when it comes to determining the quality and relevance of your site. 7. Affiliate Landing Page or Single-Page Site If you’re an affiliate, the whole point of your page may be to deliberately send people away from your website to the merchant’s site. In these instances, you’re doing the job right if the page has a higher bounce rate. A similar scenario would be if you have a single page website, such as a landing page for your ebook or a simple portfolio site. It’s common for sites like these to have a very high bounce rate since there’s nowhere else to go. Remember that Google can usually tell when a website is doing a good job satisfying user intent even if the user’s query is answered super quickly (sites like WhatIsMyScreenResolution.com come to mind). If you’re interested, you can adjust your bounce rate so it makes more sense for the goals of your website. 8. Low-Quality or Under Optimized Content To be frank, visitors may be bouncing from your website because your content is just plain bad. Take a long, hard look at your page and have your most judgmental and honest colleague or friend review it (ideally, this person either has a background in content marketing or copywriting, or they fall into your target audience). One possibility is that your content is great, but you just haven’t optimized it for online reading. Are you writing in simple sentences (think high school students vs PhDs)? Is it easily scannable with lots of headers? Have you included images to break up the copy and make it easy on the eyes? Writing for the web is different than writing for written publications. Brush up your online copywriting skills with these formatting tips from Neil Patel. The other possibility is that your content is poorly written overall or simply isn’t something your audience cares about. Consider hiring a freelance copywriter or content strategist who can help you revamp your ideas into powerful content that converts. 9. Bad or Obnoxious UX Are you bombarding people with ads, pop-up surveys, and email subscribe buttons? CTA-heavy features like these may be irresistible to the marketing and sales team, but using too many of them can make a visitor run for the hills. Is your site confusing to navigate? Perhaps your visitors are looking to explore more, but your blog is missing a search box or the menu items are difficult to click on a smartphone. As online marketers, we know our websites in and out. It’s easy to forget that what seems intuitive to us is anything but to our audience. Make sure you’re avoiding these common design mistakes, and have a web or UX designer review the site and let you know if anything pops out to them as problematic. 10. Wonky Google Analytics Setup Finally, it’s possible that you haven’t properly implemented Google Analytics and added the tracking codes to all the pages on your site. Google explains how to fix that here. Hopefully, this article has helped you diagnose what’s causing your high bounce rate, and you have a good idea how to fix it. Now get to it!   Image Credits Featured Image: Peggy_Marco/Pixabay In-post Image: RocketFuel Screenshots by Amelia Willson.

Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Alphabet’s Google have partnered once again to introduce an infotainment and connected car platform with an Android in-car system. The in-car system, dubbed Uconnect, will make its debut at CES 2017, with the Android 7.0 Nougat-powered system set to be displayed inside a Chrysler 300 sedan. According to FCA, at CES 2017 the company will demonstrate the new system which will feature core infotainment features including radio and comfort controls. Being integrated with Android, Uconnect will be built for connectivity and compatibility with several popular Android applications. FCA claims that the new system has been integrated with Google Assistant, Google Maps and other Android applications such as Pandora, Spotify, NPR One and Pocket Casts. Google Android Engineering director Patrick Brady said: “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way. “This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” FCA Electrical Engineering head Chris Barman said: “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction. “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” The new system is being claimed as the next step for Android Auto which debuted in 2015. The collaboration between Google and FCA is not part of the self driving car project being undertaken under Waymo. Recently, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles had supplied 100 Chrysler Pacifica hybrid minivans for Alphabet’s Waymo.

Drew Angerer/Getty Images Diverse teams work better. That’s a proven fact. Lack of diversity, especially in the tech world, existed on a “don’t ask, don’t tell” basis until Google released its diversity figures in mid-2014, publicly revealing the extent of the problem. Other Silicon Valley giants like Twitter and Yahoo followed suit, announcing similar findings, which freed the diversity genie out of the bottle for good. Add to the mix more comprehensive corporate social media presences and an increasing acceptance of using personal profiles for professional purposes, and these organizations have no choice but to be transparent. We can thank Google for setting this example because now we can finally have those necessary conversations about hiring for the modern workplace, one that’s filled with diverse teams–not just in terms of gender, age or ethnicity, but varying skill sets, backgrounds, sexual orientations, education and experiences. Fast-forward two-and-a-half years later and while diversity numbers are progressing, we’re still not where we need to be. Even after major, public diversity initiatives were announced, backed by multi-million dollar investments, there have been slight improvements, but none that are making a substantial impact. Perhaps it’s still too soon to tell, or perhaps we’re still not doing enough. One thing is for certain though– with the new presidential administration taking over and the sentiments that much of Silicon Valley has towards it–we can’t lose sight of the strides we’ve made in this ongoing battle, despite how small they may be. With the inevitable shifts in policies and priorities that will come as President-Elect Trump takes over, diversity must continue to be top of mind for business leaders. Aside from the ethical reasoning behind it, diverse teams have clear economic and cultural benefits. According to McKinsey, companies in the top quartile for racial/ethnic and gender diversity are more likely to have financial returns above their industry peers. Culturally diverse companies yield greater workplace satisfaction. Whether your motivation is ethical, financial, or otherwise, the only way to move the needle is for organizations and their recruiting teams to align on policy, procedure and technology. Otherwise, an informal recruiting strategy will lack the structure needed to be truly effective and make a difference. First Things First As an initial step in achieving a more reflective workforce of America, companies must establish a diversity policy. Consider this the goal-setting phase where you assess where your diversity figures stand and where you want them to be, both in the short-term and the long-term. If the financial motives aren’t enough to influence your decision, consider the cultural benefits of diverse teams, like the proven level of increased collaboration and innovation, and lower employee turnover rates. In simplest terms, diverse teams create overall stronger, happier workforces, and it’s a disservice to not put formalized guidelines in place, especially now that the cat is out of the bag. Without an official policy that includes clear goals, recruiters will not have a solid strategy to follow and might hire on a more subjective basis. As noted in the Society for Human Resource Management, key elements of a diversity policy go beyond just attracting and maintaining diverse employees – you must provide all employees with challenging work, the support that they need for professional development, receive backing of the diversity initiative from the CEO and management, include clear data-driven goals to achieve, and provide inclusion training programs. Before implementing a program that’s tailored to your individual company’s needs, remember to ensure that it’s in compliance with both state and federal discrimination guidelines.  Rules of the Road Ahead Once management establishes a policy, they must provide the HR team with clear procedural directives so that they can actively seek candidates with the specific qualities that the company needs. For instance, in the tech industry, especially in Silicon Valley, the simple math says that there are far less women than men, so to be able to acknowledge and give equal opportunity to all of the qualified female candidates out there, a company’s process must include applying extra effort to attracting women into the interview pipeline. Diversity challenges start at the top of the hiring funnel, so if women are being overlooked simply due to a numbers game, there must be a procedure to prioritize these candidates. Critics could argue on the flip side that the process of moving female prospects to the top then discriminates against men, but it provides them with a fairer chance of being noticed. The ethics of diversity-hiring procedures can be discussed endlessly, but it should boil down to providing equal opportunity to all eligible contenders, which sometimes is only achieved by boosting minorities (i.e., women, non-white, over age 40, etc.) to the top of the list.  1 Hire an HR Robot Artificial Intelligence (AI) is going to be the next big unfair advantage in business. People often assume robots are going to replace people in the corporate world, but the more accurate truth is that AI and machine learning tools are taking over tedious busywork so that humans actually have more time to interact with other humans. Recruiting is one industry where the personal experience is so vital, yet has become mechanical because tedious tasks consume HR professionals. Machines have deep learning advances and can process volumes of data that people can’t even comprehend. The issue becomes curtailing these capabilities so that we can prevent that robot takeover people are so fearful of. The answer is by setting a clear, legal distinction between what AI should be doing and what should remain in the capable hands of an individual. Diversity has been, and will continue to be, an open-ended conversation filled with differences in opinions, policies, procedures and technologies. One thing is for certain–we cannot lose the momentum that’s already underway, no matter how slow moving it may be. There are countless reasons to establish a diverse team, ranging from financial benefits to, more abstractly, creating a team that feels more inclusive, qualified and innovative. There’s clearly a lot more work that needs to be done, but following a data-driven strategy is vital, and at a minimum, major companies will continue to be held accountable for where they are and where they plan to be.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek The Downsides of Open Source Software CyanogenMod is dead, killed by parent company Cyanogen. The community is attempting to pick up the pieces and create a new project, LineageOS, based on the code. But it’s a reminder that open source software isn’t all sunshine, rainbows, and stability: in fact, it can often be very messy. Even if a project is open source, it isn’t necessarily even responsive to the community, much less a reliable piece of software you can depend on. Projects vary: Some are run by one or two developers as a hobby, others bring together developers paid by many massive corporations, while others are driven by a single parent company. Each situation has its own problems and drama. We love open source software—don’t get us wrong—but it presents a certain number of challenges. Let’s take a look at a few. Open Source Often Suffers Delays and a Glacial Development Pace Many open source projects seem to suffer from a slow development pace, where new versions are endlessly delayed, new features come slowly if ever, and it’s difficult to prioritize difficult-but-important features. Just look at Ubuntu’s attempts to launch its Unity 8 desktop and Mir display server, enabling its vision of “convergence”. This new version of the Linux desktop was supposed to be stable many years ago, and still isn’t. The project has moved at a glacial pace, so much so that Canonical was beaten to the punch by Microsoft, which announced its own vision PC-powered-by-smartphone before Windows 10—and delivered on it. Canonical still hasn’t delivered its long-promised vision yet. Maybe it’ll be stable in a few more years. RELATED ARTICLE Here’s Why Firefox is Still Years Behind Google Chrome Mozilla has also had some difficulty prioritizing. They still hasn’t delivered multi-process and sandboxing features in Firefox. These are critical to keep the browser secure, prevent crashes from taking down the whole browser, and better utilize multi-process CPUs. All other major browsers have delivered these features, including the hated Internet Explorer. Mozilla crated the “Electrolysis” project to add these features, but halted it in 2011 because it was too difficult. Mozilla then had to restart it in 2013. This feature looks set to arrive in 2017—which is really, really late. In the meantime, Mozilla wasted time working on Firefox OS, a failed smartphone operating system. When a project uses so many volunteer developers, it may have difficulty finding the people to do the hard work that isn’t fun to do. Internal Drama Begets Forks, Forks, and More Forks An open source project’s source code is available for anyone to change. That’s the point! If an open-source project changes in a way you don’t like, then you—or the community—can take that old source code and continue working on it as a new project. But community projects are often so wrapped up in internal drama that they cause things to split apart into multiple projects, confusing and alienating users. For example, when GNOME 3 launched and many GNOME 2 users weren’t happy, there wasn’t an immediate obvious path. Developers had to fork the GNOME code into other projects like MATE and Cinnamon. One desktop environment turned into three, and development resources are more scattered between projects. As a result, it took some time for the community to get these new projects going. RELATED ARTICLE OpenOffice vs. LibreOffice: What’s the Difference and Which Should You Use? Similarly, the OpenOffice community was not happy when Oracle acquired Sun. Oracle even briefly renamed its proprietary, not-open-source office suite StarOffice to “Oracle Open Office”. The community had to create a new fork, LibreOffice, based on the OpenOffice code. It has become the de facto open source office suite for many people, but others still use OpenOffice because they aren’t aware of the better fork and the drama surrounding it. OpenOffice just has a lot of built up name recognition. And, of course, there’s CyanogenMod. Cyanogen Inc just pulled the plug on CyanogenMod’s online services—meaning they would rather kill the most popular third-party Android ROM than hand it over to the community, instead forcing the community to create a new fork of CyanogenMod named LineageOS. Why doesn’t Cyanogen just hand over the CyanogenMod project to the community? The answer seems to be internal drama (are you seeing a pattern here?). Cyanogen was the company whose CEO promised they would “put a bullet through Google’s head”, after all. It ended up putting a bullet through CyanogenMod’s head, instead. This all just ends up hurting CyanogenMod’s users, who received very little notice before CyanogenMod’s servers and services will be shut down. Phones will continue working, but convenient updates and other services are going up in smoke almost overnight. Users just have to hope the LineageOS project will quickly become a replacement. Not All Open-Source Projects Are Community-Driven Open source projects aren’t always driven by the community. Saying a program is open source just means that the code is available to do what you like with. The company developing the software doesn’t necessarily have to run it as a community project, or they may have an interest in using the project to promote their other software. CyanogenMod is a good example of this. Once Cyanogen Inc. came about, they didn’t really care about CyanogenMod. Cyanogen’s new goal became marketing the Cyanogen Modular OS platform to manufacturers, trading on CyanogenMod’s great name recognition after killing the project. Perhaps that’s just where the money is. Oracle never cared about OpenOffice, but initially wanted to use its name to drive sales of its StarOffice proprietary office suite by branding it with the “Open Office” name. It then donated the project to Apache after most of the volunteer developers left. Google doesn’t really care about Android as a full open-source project, either, which is why more and more parts of the “Android Open Source Project” (or “AOSP”) are being left behind. Google wants to keep Android open so it’s easy for manufacturers to customize, but open source applications like the keyboard and dialer are becoming more and more outdated. On a consumer Android device, Google just bundles its own closed source keyboard, dialer, and other apps. Google seems committed to an Android open-source core, but not an entire open-source operating system people can use without Google’s software and services. After all, improving the Android Open Source Project just helps Amazon’s Fire OS, a competitor to Google’s Android devices. What’s the point of that? Open Source Can Lack Serious Manpower, Despite Being Used by Millions RELATED ARTICLE Heartbleed Explained: Why You Need to Change Your Passwords Now If a project is open source, anyone can use it without contributing—even massive companies. This leads to problems when an important, widely-used project has a severe lack of manpower and funds. We saw the results of this with the Heartbleed security hole back in 2014. Heartbleed exploited a vulnerability in OpenSSL. OpenSSL is an important encryption library used by many giant tech companies and hundreds of thousands of web servers. But it had just one full-time employee without outside employment and $2000 a year in donations. The project did take in additional money from commercial support contracts and consulting, but just a single full-time employee seems shockingly low for a critical piece of infrastructure used by multi-billion dollar corporations like Google and Facebook. Heartbleed drew attention to just how underfunded this critical piece of software was, so big tech companies committed to chipping in money every year to fund the development of OpenSSL and other important projects as part of the “Core Infrastructure Initiative“. There’s a good outcome to this particular story, sure—but only because so much attention was drawn to it. When you rely on an open source project to enable your infrastructure, it’s easy to end up depending on it and assume someone else is maintaining it well enough. What other important open-source project is critically underfunded? We may not notice until there’s another big problem. Image Credit: snoopsmaus JOIN THE DISCUSSION (9 REPLIES) January 3, 2017 Jason Dagless Open Source is it's own worst enemy many many times. January 3, 2017 Cambo Unfortunately, there is no business model in 'free'. People/Community can only donate their time for so long. This is why non-commercial Linux projects have never and will never take off in the consumer or enterprise markets. No stability- and when they close up shop, no one to go back to. What's very interesting is the internal squabbling in Cyanogen. The writing was on the wall years ago when they began the childish stuff of "ripping" Android from Google. BS. And they were called on it. They had 50 million users/customers- yet not a dime in income. January 3, 2017 Neph It's good to see how little research you did for CyanogenMod. It shows just how far down Howtogeek has gotten over the years. Cyanogen was trademarked when Cyanogen Inc became a public company. Now that the company is going belly under, so to goes the naming rights. The decision to change the name now was proactive in case someone picks up the trademark in bankruptcy court and tries to put pressure on the open source project. The project itself is not dead, just the automated build servers that C Inc ran, but to know that, you'd actually have to do some reading on the topic for which you wrote. January 3, 2017 Cambo The point of the article isn't what happened to CM specifically, it's the downside of Open Source software as a whole. January 3, 2017 Constantin Prigoreanu For a lot of poor (equals bad ?) developers (and clients, for sure) , it's the only way to go; a powerful exception (to mediocre quality projects) , is postgresql: it works perfectly . The not so good (that is not so good as the commercial alternatives) parts in an open project , are forcing you to make use of your brain , in order to make GOOD use of them; so , if they don't kill you (or your projects), they make you stronger ! The way to go, isn't unique, you may combine different parts from different projects ( like using SharpMap AND MapWinGIS in the same VisualStudio project), go back , delete , think again , until you get it: simple and fast ! There's no alternative to simple and fast , but failure . January 3, 2017 Lol. Burn. Even if it had been true. It's one company.The truth is that open source has a history with many long term success stories and commercial companies often stop supporting older versions to force customers to buy new versions they don't really need. Lack of support can become a problem with any model. With a community you are more likely to still find support somewhere than with a business who has ditched an 'outdated' oroduct. Planned obsolescence is the bane of the commercial model (and the environment). No incentive for it in open source where a solid and durable foundation that is built upon and only changes to provide real benefit makes more sense. Code is written with pride and excellence instead of to a deadline and a budget. It's tight and efficient compared to some of the bolt together lazy bloatware commercial offerings can produce. If it's not, someone will come along and tighten it up just because they can and they enjoy the process, the challenge and the recognition. It's another way to win. Some people actually do have intrinsic motivation to do things without needing the external reinforcement of money. That intrinsic motivation often means they are very or even exceptionally good at what they do. I'm not going to list examples. Do your homework and you will learn more than if you follow an instinctive mpulse to win by debating sgainst some specific example I provide. Of course this can all be regarded as mere opinion and I'm fine with that. You can lead a horse to water... As opinion goes it's on topic. January 3, 2017 Constantin Prigoreanu Agree 101%; i'v met smthing that made me shudder: a huge software company , that made a simple (but extremely useful) piece of software , free for clients. Wonderful ! But this piece, made it mandatory to use THE ENTIRE SOFTWARE STACK , in order to be able to generate and use the little free module; If there are enaugh clients , maybe it's worth it , but they deliberately made it impossible NOT to use the entire stack , which is prohibitively expensive. Talk about planned obsolence ... January 7, 2017 Ken Holloway I'm not sure of the business models behind open source products such as Mozilla Firefox and Apache Open Office, but these seem to me to be examples of successful open source ventures. January 11, 2017 Yes. Criticism of delivery times and stability is laughable when you look at the history of Windows. It wasn't very stable untill 98SE and really stable untill XP. NT had a different timeline. Plenty of software businesses have rollout and stability problems. That's why we talk about bugs and snags. Rollout extends to hardware as well. The fact is that any criticism you can level at an open source project can be valid in for profit organisations. Even big ones like MS and certainly smaller ones who might have smaller staff levels than some volunteer projects. To suggest delayed rollout or stability problems are somehow the bane of open source but not profit motivated businesses is wrong. You can cherry pick examples to support your hypothesis but the overall success of open source as a concept is it's own proof. Sure if you have a staff of one volunteer that becomes a potential single point of failure but the code is open. If you're a big business you should be donating to the developers not taking the piss out of volunteers for your increased profit. If you don't then it's your own fault if it goes belly up. You can still take that open source code and do something with it yourself. If that happens with proprietary code you're stuffed. Both open source and proprietary code can be imperfect at any one moment. If the purpose of the article is to warn big business not to rely on open source perhaps it should instead be for big business not to leech off open source parasitically but to donate appropriately to projects they use. Interestingly another HTG article is about how Firefox and Chrome are almost identical clones whilest this article seems to think not. Personally for my preference Chrome is too intrusive and spy orientated. I'll take Firefox and Tor everytime. Got Feedback?

Chrysler’s Next Infotainment System Could be Android-Powered Share Tweet Subscribe Get AutoGuide.com in your Inbox Like AutoGuide.com on Facebook By Sami Haj-Assaad Jan 03, 2017 The collaboration between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) and Google is extending beyond autonomous cars, as the automaker is demonstrating an Android-powered infotainment system. On display at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is a new Chrysler 300 with the UConnect 8.4 infotainment system that is now running on an Android-based operating system.    While UConnect is frequently praised for its ease of use, Android is the most popular open-source operating system in the world, powering large amounts of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. ALSO SEE: Google is Spinning Off its Self-Driving Car Unit into a New Company While car buyers may be familiar with Android Auto, a system that integrates a phone’s functions with the car’s infotainment system, this new infotainment system on display doesn’t require a smartphone. “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” said Chris Barman, Head of Electrical Engineering, FCA. “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” The demo car is capable of running Google Assistant, Google Maps, and popular Android apps including Pandora, Spotify, NPR One and Pocket Casts. “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way,” said Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, Google. “This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” The automaker is also unveiling a new self-driving concept minivan at the show, keep your eyes on AutoGudie.com’s CES coverage for more details on that and the other cool concepts and reveals from the show.

There’s no reason New Year’s resolutions have to be all serious life-changing stuff like losing weight or quitting smoking, though. This is a good time to step back and think about ways to make your Android experience better. Unlike your pledge to hit the gym every day in 2017, here are six Android resolutions you can actually keep. Stop clearing recent apps Just don’t do it. There are times when you need to swipe an app away from the overview screen on Android—maybe it’s crashing or you want to start it fresh. Compulsively clearing all the apps in the list is completely unnecessary, though. Still, some of us just can’t seem to stop doing it. Maybe we are were deeply traumatized by the dark ages of Android when task killers were necessary to have any semblance of good battery life. Swiping an app away from the recent list only ends the foreground process. Anything that needs to be running in the background will continue working, so you’re not really freeing up any memory. When Android needs RAM, it just clears out old processes anyway. The system is very good at managing this stuff now. All you’re doing is wasting time when you clear your recent apps compulsively. You might even be harming battery life, as your phone needs to work harder to re-launch apps fresh than to just take it out of the background “suspend” state. Most phones have a button to clear all recent apps; even Google added this to stock Android, but it’s way, way at the top of the list. It’s almost like whoever was told to add the button resented being forced to do it. Take the hint and stop clearing all your apps in 2017. Set your default apps It’s time to commit. One of the great things about Android is that you can choose your own default apps for various actions. But… are you actually choosing them or are you tapping “Just once” every time you’re prompted? I think many of us are suffering from fear of commitment when it comes to default apps. When a default isn’t set, most phones pop up the selection UI at the bottom of the screen. Your most recently chosen app for completing an action is at the top, and you can either tap “Just once” or “Always.” Unless you commit to a default app, you have to do the extra tap every single time. Over the course of a year, that adds up to a lot of wasted time. So in 2017, how about we make the tough call? Set those default apps. You’ll save loads of time, even if you occasionally have to dig into the settings to change a default. You can always pop into Settings and change your mind later. Make sure your photos are backed up If you don’t have a backup, you might as well not have the files at all. Most of us don’t carry cameras anymore, so all our photos are on a phone. If you’re not backing up those pictures, you’re just asking for trouble. For every person reading this who does back up their photos, there’s probably someone else who doesn’t. You don’t want to be one of those people frantically searching for a way to save their photos after their phone bootloops or the screen cracks. Backing up your photos is easier than it’s ever been on Android. If you’ve never bothered to set it up, now is the time to do it. The quickest way is the Google Photos app. Simply open it up, confirm that you want your photos backed up, and choose either original or high (compressed) quality. You get unlimited uploads in high quality, but original size counts against your storage limit of 15GB. Pixel phones get unlimited original quality uploads, and you can always buy more storage for other phones if you run out of free space. If you don’t like Google’s photo tools for some reason, there’s Dropbox. The Dropbox app also has automatic photo backups, but you only get 2GB of free storage on Dropbox. You’ll probably need to upgrade to a paid plan pretty quickly. Disable and uninstall that stuff you never use Think of it as Android spring cleaning. How many of the apps in your app drawer actually get any use? There are probably a lot that you keep around “just in case”...but in case of what? It’s so easy to install an app or game that you think sounds cool, but maybe you never get around to trying it. So, it just its there in your app drawer, taking up space and adding to the clutter. Maybe it’s time to get more proactive about ditching the stuff you never use. It’s not likely you’ll find yourself in a situation where that RSS reader or WiFi analyzer is vitally important, and you also lack internet access to download it from the Play Store. It’s okay—you’ll be able to download it from the Play Store in a few seconds in the event you ever do need it. In the case of non-removable bloatware, go into the settings and disable it once and for all. The more apps you leave installed, the more you have to scroll through looking for the ones you actually use. Let’s clear out the clutter in 2017. Set up two-factor authentication Ryan Whitwam Make your account as secure as possible. Your Google account is the key to your phone, and it can be even more than that if you use Google’s services to create documents or back up your photos (which you should be doing). You should make certain this account can’t be compromised, and the best way to do that is to set up two-factor authorization (2FA). It’s a little bit of a pain, but it’s not as bad as it used to be. With two-factor enabled, you will need to have access to your phone every time you log into your Google account. To set up 2FA, go to your Google account settings from a browser and open the Sign-in and security menu. You can opt to get one-time use codes via SMS or an authenticator app (Authy is great for this). Google also supports one-tap verification prompts on your verified phone to confirm log-ins. You should also make sure to print a copy of the backup 2FA codes provided by Google and keep them in a safe place. This will help you access your account in the event you’re locked out. Other services like Dropbox and Facebook support two-factor as well, but start with securing your Google account and see how it goes. Actually pay for quality apps and games If we don’t support developers, it’s going to be in-app purchases as far as the eye can see. Android would not be nearly as cool if not for the efforts of hard-working developers around the world. Sometimes devs see fit to create cool things for free, but they usually want to be compensated for their hard work. A lot of Android users don’t buy apps, but we should be rewarding the developers who create quality items. A few dollars for something you’ll get a lot of use out of is completely reasonable, and it keeps devs in business. There are a lot of games that use clever psychological ploys to push people into making in-app purchases over and over. It’s only become more common over time because these apps are downloaded much more often than games that just cost a few dollars up-front. Buying a game that doesn’t have in-app purchases every now and then keeps developers interested in making such titles. Otherwise, we’re all going to be stuck paying $0.99 for baskets of gems in every game, eventually. Remember, Google’s return period was changed to 2 hours a while back. So, you should have a chance to test any app or game you buy. Take a chance in 2017 and support your local Android app developer. These are just a few ways you can start off 2017 right on Android. You can probably come up with some of your own, and you should. It’s good to have a backup when that daily gym thing doesn’t work out.

Name: Subject: Message: Remotely control your Hyundai with the help of Google Home Newsby Mitja Rutnik2 weeks ago 5 446 5 This post was originally published on our sister site, Charged.io. The Blue Link service offered by Hyundai has a bunch of great remote access features. For instance, you can start your car and even lock or unlock it with the help of your mobile device. At CES in Las Vegas, the South Korean car manufacturer has announced a partnership with Google that takes its Blue Link service to another level. The already mentioned remote access features can now be controlled with the help of the Google Home. It’s quite simple to use, as all you have to do is tell Google Home to start your car, lock/unlock it, or even to send directions (Google Maps) straight to your vehicle. Hyundai said that more features will be added soon but the company did not clarify what these additional features might be. It also didn’t specify an exact date as to when the Google Home integration will be officially released. See also: Google Home review – the future of the home?

Easy to install and manage. User-friendly app. Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) enabled. Very good throughput in testing. Cons Expensive. Lacks USB ports. Does not support dedicated band control. Bottom Line The Linksys Velop provides Wi-Fi coverage for your entire home and seamless roaming over a single network. It's stylish, easy to install, and delivers fast single-user and MU-MIMO throughput speeds, making it our top pick for Wi-Fi systems. By John R. Delaney The Linksys Velop ($499.99 for the 3-Pack we tested) represents the company's entry into the growing Wi-Fi system market, joining Eero, Google Wifi, the Netgear Orbi, and a smattering of others. As with much of the competition, the Velop is good looking, easy to install and manage, and blankets your home with Wi-Fi coverage, allowing you to roam from room to room without having to connect to range extenders or access points. Although it's the most expensive system we've reviewed, it delivered the best overall performance in our throughput testing and it offers the most robust feature set. It's our top pick for home Wi-Fi systems. //Compare Similar Products Compare Netgear Orbi High-Performance AC3000 Tri-Band Wi-Fi System (RBK50)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Securifi Almond 3 Smart Home Wi-Fi System   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Google Wifi   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Ubiquiti Amplifi HD Home Wi-Fi System   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Eero   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Luma Home WiFi System   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Trendnet AC2600 StreamBoost MU-MIMO WiFi Router (TEW-827DRU)   %displayPrice%%seller% see it Do I Need a Wi-Fi System? Why Not a Standard Router? If you have a large home, Wi-Fi systems provide an easy way to install a far-reaching wireless network in your home without the need for range extenders, access points, or additional wiring. Most systems, including the Velop, the Luma Home WiFi System, and Eero, utilize satellites and employ mesh technology that allows those satellites (which are actually individual routers) to communicate with one another and with wireless clients throughout your home (the Netgear Orbi, another top pick, is a bit different; it uses a dedicated 5GHz Wi-Fi radio band to communicate with its satellites). The main benefit of a Wi-Fi system is roaming connectivity; each satellite is part of the same network and provides seamless Wi-Fi from one point to another. That means you don't have to worry about logging in to a range extender or access point as you move from room to room. Moreover, they don't require much management or configuring, unlike a router/range extender or router/access point combination. View All 8 Photos in Gallery Design and Features Wi-Fi systems come in all shapes and sizes, from Google Wifi's smallish, puck-shaped nodes to the lumbering cylindrical towers of the Netgear Orbi. The Velop 3-Pack consists of three identical, sleeking-looking glossy-white tapered mini towers (nodes) that stand 7.28 inches tall and measure 3.07 by 3.07 inches at the base and 2.6 by 2.6 inches at the top. There's a tiny LED status light on the top of each node, and the base holds two Gigabit LAN ports, a power jack, an On/Off switch, and a reset switch. There are no USB ports on any of the nodes. The LED light shines blue when connected, red when it loses its Internet connection, yellow when it is out of range, and purple during setup. Each of the three nodes covers up to 2,000 square feet, which means that the 3-Pack will provide Wi-Fi coverage for homes up to 6,000 square feet. If you live in a smaller dwelling, you can purchase a single node for $199.99 or a 2-Pack for $349.99. You can also extend your network by adding nodes. In comparison, each Luma and Eero module covers up to 1,000 square feet, while the Netgear Orbi uses two modules to cover up to 4,000 square feet, and Google Wifi uses three modules to cover 4,500 square feet. Each Velop node is an AC2200 router that can deliver maximum speeds of up to 400Mbps on the 2.4GHz band and 867Mbps on each of the two 5GHz bands. Inside each node are six antennas, tri-band 802.11ac circuitry (one 2.4GHz band and two 5GHz bands), a quad-core ARM Cortex X-7 processor, and 512MB of RAM. The Velop and the Netgear Orbi are the only Wi-Fi systems we've tested that support Multi-User Multiple Input, Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) data streaming, which transmits data to compatible clients simultaneously rather than sequentially, allowing for faster all-around throughput speeds. As with Google Wifi, Velop offers a robust combination of management features, including parental controls, guest networking, device prioritization, and a handful of advanced settings (port forwarding, MAC filtering, and Internet connection type). In comparison, the Netgear Orbi comes with more advanced settings, but lacks guest networking, and the Securifi Almond 3 and Luma systems lack device-prioritization capabilities. The Velop system is configured and managed using Linksys' free iOS or Android app. The app is easy to navigate, and offers helpful tips for changing settings. It opens to a Dashboard screen that displays the name of the network, how many devices are connected, and buttons to turn Guest Access, Parental Controls, and Device Prioritization on or off. In the Parental Controls menu, you can select a device to control and block access to specific sites, or you can completely block access to the Internet. Blocked devices are then listed on the Dashboard page. The Device Prioritization menu lets you select up to three client devices for priority Internet access, and these devices also appear on the Dashboard page. The Guest Access menu lets you configure a guest network with Internet access, but no access to other devices on your network, including drives, printers, and other peripherals and PC systems. You can turn guest networking on and off using Amazon's Alexa voice commands. Advanced Wi-Fi settings are limited to choosing a security type and a Wi-Fi mode, and you can use the Channel finder to select the best Wi-Fi channel for each node. There's also a Speed Test option that measures Internet upload and download speeds, and a Velop Administration section that lists the status of each installed node, the current firmware version, and IP details. Here, you can send diagnostic information to Linksys and report specific issues. Installation and Performance Wi-Fi systems are designed for fast and easy installation, and with its illustrated in-app instructions, the Velop follows suit. To start, I downloaded the app to my iPhone, selected Setup New Wi-Fi Network, and created an account. The first thing the app wanted to know is if I currently use a router/modem combo or a separate router and modem. Next, it instructed me to plug in a node and place it out in the open. It took around 30 seconds for the app to find the node, at which time the LED light began flashing purple. I connected the node to my modem/router combo, and the app instructed me to sit back and relax while it connected to the Internet. After 40 seconds or so, I was connected and prompted to personalize my Wi-Fi by creating a name and password for the new network. I picked a location (living room, family room, office, etc.) and was prompted to add another node or quit setup. Installing additional nodes was simple; I placed the second node in my kitchen, plugged it in, and tapped Add Another Node in the app. It went through the same handshaking process as before and performed a signal test (dubbed Spotfinder) to make sure the node was not too far away from the main node. If it is too far away, the app will ask you to relocate the node before repeating the connection process. Once connected, I assigned a location to complete the installation. I repeated the process for the third node, which I placed in the basement. See How We Test Wireless Routers An impressive performer, The Velop turned in some of the highest scores of any Wi-Fi system in our throughput speed tests. With the exception of the Ubiquiti Amplifi HD, every Wi-Fi system we've tested, including the Velop, uses automatic band steering to provide the best possible performance. As such, these scores are based on the system's band-steering capabilities. In our close-proximity (same-room) test, the Velop's main node score of 556Mbps led the field by a healthy margin; the Netgear Orbi scored 460Mbps, the Luma garnered 457Mbps, and the Eero had a throughput of 188.7Mbps. It was better than the 187Mbps for the Securifi Almond 3, 459Mbps for the Ubiquiti Amplifi HD, and 491Mbps for the Google Wifi. At 30 feet, the Velop scored 236Mbps, once again beating the Netgear Orbi (223Mbps), the Luma (76.1Mbps), the Securifi Almond 3 (161Mbps), the Eero (71.2Mbps), the Ubiquiti Amplifi HD (223Mbps), and the Google Wifi (175Mbps). To compare these scores with a traditional router, our midrange Editors' Choice, the Trendnet AC2600 StreamBoost MU-MIMO WiFi Router (TEW-827DRU), bested all Wi-Fi systems with a score of 590Mbps in the close-proximity test and 260Mbps in the 30-foot test. The Velop's Kitchen and Basement nodes scored 257Mbps and 328Mbps, respectively, in the close-proximity test, easily beating the Securifi Almond 3 (90.3Mbps and 115Mbps), the Google Wifi (182Mbps and 111Mbps), the Ubiquiti Amplifi HD (193Mbps and189Mbps), and the Luma (106Mbps and 101Mbps). The Netgear Orbi's satellite scored a leading 460Mbps. In the 30-foot test, the Velop nodes took top honors, with scores of 238Mbps and 286Mbps, compared with the Securifi Almond 3 (80.6Mbps and 96.2Mbps), the Google Wifi (141Mbps and 117Mbps), the Ubiquiti Amplifi HD (168Mbps and 162Mbps), the Luma (77.2Mbps and 75Mbps), and the Netgear Orbi (220Mbps). We test MU-MIMO performance using three identical Acer Aspire R13 laptops equipped with Qualcomm's QCA61x4A MU-MIMO circuitry. The Velop's main node averaged 264Mbps in the close-proximity tests and 116.2Mbps in the 30-foot test. The Netgear Orbi's main node only managed 128Mbps in the close-proximity test, but had a throughput of 124Mbps at 30 feet. The Velop nodes averaged 60.1Mbps (Kitchen) and 70.1 (Basement) in the close-proximity MU-MIMO tests, compared with the Netgear Orbi's score of 127.6Mbps. At 30 feet, the Velop nodes scored 50.8Mbps and 57.8Mbps, respectively, to the Netgear Orbi's throughput of 124Mbps. Our traditional router, the Trendnet TEW-827DRU, garnered a speed of 238.3Mbps (close proximity) and 127.6Mbps (30 feet) in the MU-MIMO tests. Conclusion The Linksys Velop is ideal for non-technical users who want whole-home Wi-Fi coverage without having to configure range extenders or access points. It takes minutes to install and requires very little management, and its stylish nodes will fit right in with any home décor. Granted, the 3-Pack is $200 more expensive than Google Wifi and $100 more than the Netgear Orbi, but it offers more coverage than either. (The Velop 2-Pack is $349 and covers 4,000 feet, which puts the price in line with the competition). More important, it delivers the best all-around throughput performance of any Wi-Fi system we've seen to date, and it's ready for MU-MIMO data streaming. As such, it's our latest Editors' Choice for home Wi-Fi systems. Back to top PCMag may earn affiliate commissions from the shopping links included on this page.

(Photo: Jefferson Graham) LOS ANGELES — In 2016, both tech start-up eero and Google gave consumers new ways to fix dead Wi-fi zones in the home by creating a network of multiple routers. Now router leader Linksys responds with its own system, Velop, a similar multi-unit offering that tries to stay competitive with eero and Google by integrating power and voice commands with Amazon's Echo. Alexa can remind you about your Internet password and announce it to your home guests as well. "And if you need a WiFi timeout, and everyone is getting together for dinner, you can say, `Alexa, turn off Linksys Wi-Fi," says Kieran Hannon, the chief marketing officer for Belkin International, the parent company of Linksys. The idea is that you plug one unit into your current Internet, then spread the other units around the home to distribute the signal. The three-unit package will be available for $499, which is on par with eero's non-holiday pricing, but more expensive than Google's, which starts at $129 for one (or three for $299.) In November, eero announced it would work with Amazon's Alexa, bringing three of Alexa's "skill sets" to the router system — turn off LED lights, find your smartphone, and turn off Wi-Fi for a spell.

Happy new year! Here’s to a fabulously connected year ahead, where we all hope the Internet does more good than harm. As I’m sure you’ve been seeing, everyone’s making their top trends in 2017 lists. Full disclosure – I’m very bad at lists. So there is no list from me. What I really should have done is ask you what you thought the online trends of 2017 would be. But all is not lost. Now that you know it’s in the offing, let’s plan our list for 2018 and I’ll work up an easy way for everyone to contribute. I promise! And we all have one whole year to prep. For 2017, however, the one big thing that I believe will go mainstream is Voice. Voice is the new interface We’ve all seen this somewhere. Someone talks into a phone and something starts happening – music starts playing, lights go on, an Uber arrives at their door. All these things happen without them touching their smartphone. It all happens because they just spoke out loud, almost like making a wish. Possibly the most familiar prompts for this seemingly magical virtual assistant are the phrases: “Hey Siri” and “OK Google”. Microsoft also has their virtual assistant Cortana and Amazon has Alexa, but more about those another day. A dosa or a saucer? Virtual assistants have been around for a while, and weren’t good for much, especially if you had any accent that wasn’t very American. Each time I ask Siri, “Where can I get a dosa” it thinks I’m asking “Where can I get an awesome / saucer / Dawson”. Google Now, however, has learnt a tremendous amount in the last few years and can recognise Indian accents, as well as many others. It totally understands that I want a dosa and pulls up Google Maps showing me a plethora of places to choose from, complete with reviews and travel times. English-shminglish Last October, Google announced that the second language they were adding to their shiny new artificial intelligence Google Assistant was Hindi. This is really big news for obvious reasons. To make all this advanced technology accessible to the most number of people, we need an interface that’s so easy and intuitive, it’s natural. This interface isn’t a predictive keyboard in Tamil, or a touchscreen in Gujarati – it’s our voice. And not all of us speak English. Imagine having all the information on the Internet available to you, by only having to ask a question, or voicing a thought, with the results delivered to you in your language. The applications and possibilities seem limitless. Mainstream? But ultimately, none of this will work unless we stop feeling like complete idiots while talking to our phones in public. This is the only reason I do not speak to my smartphone while out and about, and keep my conversations with virtual assistants limited to dinner party tricks, or asking about the weather in the confines of my home. Mainstream is when everyone is using voice all the time and the rest of us join in to stop looking like idiots.

Skip to content To Inform is to Influence IO, SC, PD, what's in a name? Menu About Information Operations Holistic Organizers IO, Cyber, SC, PD Community Calendar China · Information Warfare Chinese Information Warfare: The Panda That Eats, Shoots, and Leaves January 3, 2017 Joel Harding Chinese hackers stole Google search engine secrets BY: Bill Gertz January 3, 2017 5:00 am Bill Gertz, senior editor of the Washington Free Beacon, describes the growing threat posed by information warfare in his new book, “iWar: War and Peace in the Information Age,” (Threshold Editions). The following is an excerpt from the book, out this week. The year is 2028. It is August and the weather is hot. People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Col. Sun Kangzhou and three highly trained special operations commandos from the Chengdu military region in southern China are sitting in two vehicles outside a Wal-Mart Supercenter in rural Pennsylvania about 115 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. Dressed in jeans, t-shirts, and work boots, the men appear to be just like any construction workers. In fact, Colonel Sun and his men are members of the elite Falcon special forces team. One of the vehicles is a heavy-duty pickup truck with a trailer carrying a large backhoe. The other is a nondescript blue sedan. The commandos’ target today is not a military base but something much more strategic. It has been two weeks since the deadly military confrontation between a Chinese guided-missile destroyer and a U.S. Navy P-8 maritime patrol aircraft thousands of miles away in the South China Sea. The 500-foot-long Luyang II missile warship Yinchuan made a fatal error by firing one of its HHQ-9 long-range surface-to-air missiles at the P-8 as it flew some 77 miles away. The militarized Boeing 737 had been conducting a routine electronic reconnaissance mission over the sea, something the Chinese communist government in Beijing routinely denounces as a gross violation of sovereignty. The Chinese missile was tracked by the P-8’s sensors after a radar alarm signal went off, warning of the incoming attack. The advance sensor warning allowed the P-8 pilot to maneuver the jet out of range of the missile. The crew watched it fall into the sea. Fearing a second missile launch, the pilot ordered the crew to fire back. The aircraft bay doors opened and an antiship cruise missile, appropriately named SLAM-ER, for Standoff Land Attack Missile-Expanded Response, took off. Minutes later, the missile struck the ship, sinking the vessel and killing most of the crew. The South China Sea incident, as the military encounter was called, was just the kind of military miscalculation senior American military leaders feared would take place for years, as China’s military forces over the years had built up military forces on disputed islands and gradually claimed the entire strategic waterway as its maritime territory. Following the South China Sea incident, U.S.-China tensions reached a boiling point with threats and counterthreats, including official Chinese government promises of retaliation. In Washington, phone calls to Chinese political leaders went unanswered. Beijing streets were filled with thousands of protesters in what were carefully orchestrated government-run demonstrations denouncing America. The demonstrators were demanding payback for sinking the warship. Tensions were the highest in history and threatened to end the peaceful period since the two major trading partners shelved their ideological differences beginning in the 1980s. Colonel Sun and his team are now striking back in ways the United States would never suspect. The sabotage mission they have embarked on is unlike any conducted before and is one that China’s military over the past two decades has been secretly training to carry out: an information warfare attack on the American electrical power grid. Chinese military intelligence hackers, after decades of covert cyber intrusions into American industrial control computer networks, have produced a detailed map of the United States’ most critical infrastructure—the electrical power grid stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific and north and south between Canada and Mexico. Unbeknownst to the FBI, CIA, or National Security Agency, the Chinese have discovered a strategic vulnerability in the grid near the commandos’ location. The discovery was made by China’s Unit 61398, the famed hacker group targeted in a U.S. federal grand jury indictment more than a decade earlier, which named five of the unit’s PLA officers. The officers and their supporters had laughed off the Americans’ legal action as just another ineffective measure by what Beijing believed had become the weakened “paper tiger” that was the United States. The raid is code-named Operation Duanlu—Operation Short-Circuit—and was approved by the Communist Party of China Central Military Commission a day earlier. The commission is the ultimate power in China, operating under the principle espoused by People’s Republic of China founder Mao Zedong, who understood that political power grows from the barrel of a gun. The two commandos in the truck drive off to a remote stretch of highway several miles away to a point that was previously identified near a large hardwood tree that has grown precariously close to a key local power line. The truck drives by the tree, whose roots have been weakened on the side away from the power lines by the commandos weeks earlier. The backhoe arm pushes the tree over and into the power lines, disrupting the flow of electricity and shutting down power throughout the area. At precisely the same time as the tree strikes the power lines, Colonel Sun sits in the car, boots up a laptop computer, and with a few keystrokes activates malicious software that has been planted inside the network of a nearby electrical substation. The substation is one of the most modern power centers and is linked to the national grid through “smart grid” technology designed to better automate and operate the U.S. electrical infrastructure. The smart grid technology, however, has been compromised years earlier during a naïve U.S. Energy Department program to cooperate with China on advanced electrical power transmission technology. The Chinese cooperated, and they also stole details of the new U.S. grid system and provided them to Chinese military intelligence. Once in control of the substation’s network, Colonel Sun sets in motion a cascading electrical power failure facilitated by cyberattacks but most important carried out in ways that prevent even the supersecret National Security Agency, America’s premier cyber-intelligence agency, from identifying the Chinese cyberattackers and linking them to Beijing. The agency never recovered from the damage to its capabilities caused years earlier by a renegade contractor whose charges of illegal domestic spying led to government restrictions on its activities that ultimately prevent the agency from catching the Chinese before the electrical infrastructure cyberattack. For political leaders, the devastating power outage is caused by a tree in Pennsylvania, leading to a cascading power outage around the nation. The Chinese conducted the perfect covert cyberattack, which cripples the United States, throwing scores of millions of Americans into pre-electricity darkness for months. Millions of deaths will ensue before Washington learns of the Chinese military role and, rather than fight back, makes a humiliating surrender to all Beijing’s demands—withdrawal of all U.S. military forces from Asia to areas no farther west than Hawaii, and an end to all military relationships with nations in Asia. *** The above scenario is fictional. Yet the devastation a future information warfare attack would have on critical infrastructures in the United States is a real and growing danger. No other nation today poses a greater danger to American national security than China, a state engaged in an unprecedented campaign of information warfare using both massive cyberattacks and influence operations aimed at diminishing what Beijing regards as its most important strategic enemy. Yet American leaders remain lost in a Cold War political gambit that once saw China as covert ally against the Soviet Union. Today the Soviet Union is gone but China remains a nuclear-armed communist dictatorship on the march. From an information warfare stance, China today has emerged as one of the most powerful and capable threats facing the United States. By May 2016 American intelligence agencies had made a startling discovery: Chinese cyber-intelligence services had developed technology and network penetration skills allowing them to control the results of Internet searches conducted on Google’s world-famous search engine. By controlling one of the most significant Information Age technologies used in refining and searching the massive ocean of data on the internet, the Chinese are now able to control and influence what millions of users in China see when they search using Google. Thus a search for the name Tiananmen—the main square in Beijing, where Chinese troops murdered unarmed prodemocracy protesters in June 1989—can be spoofed by Chinese information warriors into returning results in which the first several pages make no reference to the massacre. The breakthrough is similar to the kind of totalitarian control outlined in George Orwell’s novel Nineteen Eighty-Four with the creation of a fictional language called Newspeak, which was used to serve the total dominance of the state. Technically, what China did was a major breakthrough in search engine optimization—the art and science of making sites appear higher or lower in search listings. The feat requires a high degree of technical skill to pull off and would require learning the secret algorithms—self-contained, step- by-step computer search operations—used by Google. The intelligence suggests that Chinese cyberwarfare researchers had made a quantum leap in capability by actually gaining access to Google secrets and machines and adjusting the algorithms to make sure searches are produced according to Chinese information warfare goals. Those goals are to promote continued rule by the Communist Party of China and to attack and defeat China’s main enemy: the United States of America. Thus Chinese information warriors can continue the lies and deception that China poses no threat, is a peaceful country, does not seek to take over surrounding waterways, and does not abuse human rights, and that its large-scale military buildup is for purely defensive purposes. The dominant battle space for Chinese information warfare programs is the internet, using a combination of covert and overt means. The most visible means of attack can be seen in Chinese media that is used to control the population domestically, and to attack the United States, Japan, and other declared enemies through an international network of state-controlled propaganda outlets, both print and digital, that have proved highly effective in influencing foreign audiences. One of the flagship party mouthpieces is China Daily, an English-language newspaper with a global circulation of 900,000 and an estimated 43 million readers online. China Central Television, known as CCTV, operates a 24-hour cable news outlet as well to support its information warfare campaigns. One of the most damaging Chinese cyberattacks against the United States was the theft of federal employee records in the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in 2015. That attack took place after an earlier private sector cyber strike against millions of medical records held by the major health-care provider Anthem. The data theft included the massive loss of 21.5 million records. Worse, the OPM delicately announced that among those millions of stolen records was “an incident” affecting background investigation records, among some of the most sensitive information in the government’s possession used in determining eligibility for access to classified information. It was a security disaster for the millions who held security clearances and were now vulnerable to Chinese intelligence targeting, recruitment, and neutralization. A senior U.S. intelligence official briefed on the classified details of the OPM told me that the early technical intelligence analysis of the data theft revealed that it was part of a PLA military hacking operation. “It is fair to say this is a Chinese PLA cyberattack,” said the official, adding that the conclusion was based on an analysis of the software operating methods used to gain access to the government network. The threat was not theoretical. In the months after the OPM breach, several former intelligence officials began receiving threatening telephone calls that authorities believe stemmed from the compromised information obtained from OPM background investigation data hacked by the Chinese. The response by the Obama administration to the Chinese hacking was to ignore it, despite appeals from both national security officials and private security experts that immense damage was being done to American interests and that something needed to be done to stop the attacks. The White House, however, under Obama had adopted a see-no-evil approach to Chinese hacking that would endure throughout his administration and border on criminal neglect. On several occasions, Obama and his key White House aides were presented with proposals for proactive measures against the Chinese designed to send an unmistakable signal to Beijing that the cyberattacks would not be tolerated. Intelligence officials revealed to me that beginning in August 2011, a series of policy options were drawn up over three months. They included options for conducting counter-cyberattacks against Chinese targets and economic sanctions against key Chinese officials and agencies involved in the cyberattacks. The president rejected all the options as too disruptive of U.S.-China economic relations. Obama never explained why he refused to take action against China, but he clearly rejected anything that might make the United States appear as a world leader and power. By the summer of 2015, the group of sixteen U.S. intelligence agencies—including the CIA, DIA, and NSA—that make up what is called the intelligence community weighed in on the growing threat of strategic cyberattacks against the United States. In their top-secret National Intelligence Estimate, the consensus was that as long as the continued policy of not responding remained in place, the United States would continue to be victimized by increasingly damaging cyber- attacks on both government and private sector networks. A strong reaction was essential. Chinese cyberattacks have been massive and have inflicted extreme damage to U.S. national security. Among the exotic Chinese information weapons Beijing plans to use in a future conflict are holographic projectors and laser-glaring arms that can present large unusual images in the skies above enemy forces that would simulate hallucinations among troops on the ground, according to one recent translated Chinese military report on the subject. Traditional propaganda also will be used, including “public opinion propaganda and PSYWAR weapons to execute psychological attacks against the enemy, so as to disrupt the enemy command decision making, disintegrate the enemy troop morale, and shake the enemy’s will to wage war,” according to recently translated Chinese military writings. Stefan Halper, a Cambridge University professor and editor of Pentagon study on Chinese information warfare, told me the Chinese are far more advanced than the Pentagon in the art of information war. “We’re in a period where it’s not whose army wins. It’s whose story wins, and the Chinese figured that out very quickly,” Halper says. “They’re way ahead of us in this. We’re in an age where nuclear weapons are no longer usable. They understand that. We keep nattering on about nuclear capabilities, and shields and so on, but it’s really quite irrelevant.” As Jake Bebber, a U.S. Cyber Command military officer, put it, the threat from China and its strategy of seeking the destruction of the United States have been misunderstood by the U.S. government and military. “China seeks to win without fighting, so the real danger is not that America will find itself in a war with China, but that America will find itself the loser without a shot being fired,” he wrote in a report for the Center for International Maritime Security. In the future, an American president must come to the realization that the decades-long policy of appeasing and accommodating the communist regime in Beijing is not just contrary to American national interests, but is in fact advancing a new strategic threat to free and democratic systems everywhere. Retired army lieutenant general and former DIA director Michael Flynn, the incoming White House national security adviser, has criticized the failure to understand Information Age threats and respond to them forcefully. “Until we redefine warfare in the age of information, we will continue to be viciously and dangerously attacked with no consequences for those attackers,” he told me. “The extraordinary intellectual theft ongoing across the U.S.’s cyber-critical infrastructure has the potential to shut down massive components of our nation’s capabilities, such as health care, energy, and communications systems. This alone should scare the heck out of everyone.” China today employs strategic information warfare to defeat its main rival: the United States. China’s demands to control social media and the Internet are part of its information warfare against America and must be resisted if free and open societies and the information technology they widely use are to prevail. China remains the most dangerous strategic threat to America—both informationally and militarily.

In a list of 2016's 50 most vulnerable products, compiled by CVE Details, Android OS was found to be by far the most exploited service of the year, with 523 known security flaws, followed by Debian Linux at 319. Notably, the number of Android vulnerabilities was almost double that of Adobe Flash in fourth place, widely regarded as a bug prone and insecure platform for web content. However, Adobe was the clear winner when vulnerabilities were ranked in terms of vendor, with 1,383 known bugs. Of the 10 products at the top of the list, four come from Adobe, namely Flash Player, Acrobat, Acrobat DC and Reader. Microsoft was not far behind, in second place with overall vendor vulnerabilities at 1,325, covering services such as Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Microsoft Edge and Windows Server 2012. The results are slightly skewed, as bug hunters are incentivised by Google to root out vulnerabilities for cash rewards, including $20,000 for exploits granting remote access to Google servers, which may account for the surprisingly high number of flaws. A security flaw found in software running on Qualcomm chipsets in August 2016 was feared to have affected more than 900 million devices, including the HTC One and US versions of the Samsung Galaxy S7. In October last year, Google released fixes for a staggering 78 vulnerabilities, including a serious privilege escalation bug, initially discovered in Linux OS but proved to have been inherited by Android, allowing for hackers to bypass security and gain root level access to devices. Google Chrome was found to have the greatest number of vulnerabilities at 172, followed by Microsoft's Edge at 135 and Mozilla's Firefox with 133. Safari is the most secure browser according to the CVE figures, at just 56 vulnerabilities in 2016. Apple's iPhone OS, Watch OS and Apple TV also made it onto the top 50 list, but collectively made up only 340 vulnerabilities. Microsoft Office ranked at the bottom of the list, with just 48 security flaws.

Home India news In future, carriers can provide services comparable to Google and Amazon: Vmware’s Shekar Ayyar In future, carriers can provide services comparable to Google and Amazon: Vmware’s Shekar Ayyar Shekar Ayyar, Corporate Senior Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development, VMware spoke to Anup Jayaram on how virtualization is changing the telecom sector. By: Anup Jayaram | Updated: January 4, 2017 11:03 PM Shekar Ayyar, Corporate Senior Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development, VMware spoke to Anup Jayaram on how virtualization is changing the telecom sector. (Source: Website) Over the years, telecom operators have been opting for software solutions to reduce costs. As operators look to provide more value added services on their existing architecture, they opt for virtualization. That’s what VMware, now a part of Dell Technologies does among other things. Shekar Ayyar, Corporate Senior Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Development, VMware spoke to Anup Jayaram on how virtualization is changing the telecom sector. Edited excerpts: Q: How have things changed for VMware in recent times? A: In the last two years we noticed a growing emphasis in telcos on efficiency and agility improvement on the IT side translating to similar transformation on the network side of the architecture. Every telco is under cost and competitive pressure. With internet of things (IoT), they’re also asking questions on how to provide more value added services on top of their existing architecture. So, the journey that we have seen over the past couple of decades in IT is now trying to repeat itself in the telco network side. VMware has gone on the network side to about 80 plus production deployments globally across 45 carriers. We have also accumulated 200-250 million mobile subscribers on VMware architecture. You can use that to deploy not just one virtual network function but multiple functions in the same architecture. Because this is done on software you can decide to launch a new service tonight and deployment time is anything from hours to maybe weeks. Q: What all comes under virtualization? A: You can split it network wise into two groups. One is VCPE (Virtual Customer Premises equipment) applications, while the other are closer to the cloud and are clubbed under (VEPC Virtual Evolved Packet Core) applications. It allows a telco to go to an enterprise and offer them cheaper connectivity because they can intelligently manage traffic on IP and non-IP networks dedicated networks as they have virtualized their infrastructure. Another service they can deploy is owning a set top box. Then there are mobile consumer and enterprise services that can get deployed of which voice over LTE is a classic example. Q: How many telcos are doing it? A: Globally it is between 400-500 carriers. Some are complicated because they have many companies, but assume there are 400 individual companies. Of those, about a third are actively talking about or planning on doing something today. The others are on the education cycle of understanding what is happening. This time last year I would have said Indian telcos were lagards. The advent of Jio has caused ripples. One of the things Jio has done is prompted other telcos to get to 4G and LTE like environment quickly. Q: Is this primarily due to Jio? A: This is the Jio effect. We feel the initial move might be defensive, either because a competitor has done it or because there is a cost pressure. But the ability to deploy a new service followed by others to eventually becoming a marketplace where you could imagine that one or more of the Indian telcos could become the local hub for all services that a consumer or an enterprise who want to consume through the global network. Q: What kind of services can you expect? A: The base level includes better voice and more secure exchange of information. Then there will be innovative services like connected cars or mobile medical applications. It’s going to make the competitive environment increasingly complex. Today it is between Reliance, Bharti, Idea and Vodafone competing for services. But once you extend that to payments, retail gateways and IoT services you’re going to expand that competitive domain to Amazon, Google and others. It’s no longer going to be just this narrow slice of competition. Q: How do you see Google and Amazon coming into play and how do they compete? A: Today they compete globally with telcos because they are the de-facto OTT marketplaces. Even though the backbone and core network is provided by carriers, the actual Android marketplace is dominated by Google and the Apple marketplace by Apple. Amazon has its own marketplace and these are not in any way dependent explicitly on carriers. In a new world, carriers can effectively create, deploy and provide services comparable to Google and Amazon. When that happens, your carrier might actually be the host marketplace for all services you consume. Search from Google might become one application that you consume on your carrier smartphones and retail Amazon might become one of those as opposed to going to Amazon and making that your home base. At the OTT level there is an IP backbone that couples with the mobile network so that if you want Android services, it is delivered on an Android marketplace that uses everything underneath this as plumbing. Q: They don’t have to go to Google to search… A: Yeah, exactly. That means they would offer that service through their portal. It’s a reversal of what is happening today and the reason they are not able to do it today is because networks are not flexible enough to allow them to become developer oriented portals. Q: Has it happened in the US? A: It’s starting. You got carriers starting to provide a certain set of services. Google and Amazon would look to become more of your communications provider where today they are a service provider on top of your communication network. But at some point you can imagine that you’ll get your mobile service from Google or Amazon. Q: So the divide that we had as application provider and network provider is going? A: Historically you had landline, mobile telephony, cloud. Now, they’re all starting to get blurred because some advanced customers are asking us for architectures that are common across IT, cloud and network. That brings together a common platform for them to deploy and develop services. You can then treat Google as your mobile platform and your mobile carrier as the portal provider for everything. So, that’s how this will evolve. I think boundaries that are there will no longer be maintained. You May Also Like To Watch This: Q: How will that change things for VMware? A: We are a pure play software infrastructure vendor and to that extent there will always be an opportunity for that. But we will always remain a plumbing provider to somebody that takes our component and then makes something out of it. Q: 5G will be more of M2M than faster data… A: 5G will be more M2M. But, India is so vast, the population large and economic disparity huge. So there is as much an emphasis on optimizing and extracting value on older technologies as about adoption of technologies. Reliance has pushed the envelope on 4G by becoming a pioneer in that. I don’t know if anybody will do something similar on 5G. If they do, maybe India will be a forerunner in that, but outside of that India has demonstrated the ability to leapfrog. India will not be at the leading edge of technology but probably a year behind. The Indian market volume is high, but expectations in terms of price is calibrated to the economic environment. For vendors like us, it’s a bit of a dilemma because you’ve got the ability to deploy large volumes but margin profile is not the same as the rest of world. Q: How well is VMWare doing? A: There is the $100 billion capex market that global communication service providers deploy. We see the move to software taking a portion of that spend and converting that to addressable market for a VMware. Somewhere between $2 billion to $8-10 billion in that window will be directly addressable by us between 2018-2020. If you take the conservative end of that spectrum and we are 50%, a billion dollars of that could accrue. If you are a 10% shareholder, then there’s $200 million.

Consider it done Appystore: An app to boost your little ones' learning Airtel and Vodafone subscribers in India have begun seeing an option to pay for apps, games, books and movies on Google’s Play Store through their carriers, allowing them to buy services on their Android devices without a credit/debit card or net banking. Combined, the country’s two largest mobile service providers have around 450 million subscribers, giving Google a massive base of customers who will now be able to buy services on its store more easily. The company’s Android operating system powers nine out of 10 smartphones in the country. Google has not officially announced the launch of carrier billing for Airtel and Vodafone users in the country, but both prepaid and postpaid users have begun seeing the option. Upon initiating a payment however, users are shown an error message suggesting the integration isn’t yet complete.  “We’re continually looking at ways to enhance user experience, including payment options available on our Play Store,” said a Google spokesperson.  Google began carrier billing in partnership with Idea Cellular in May last year. The company also introduced the option to pay through net banking late last year as it tried to get more Indians to buy content and services on its Play Store. With carrier billing, Google will be able to tap users without credit/debit cards or those that have them but do not use them to make online purchases. India’s 250-300-mn strong smartphone user base is predominantly on Android. However, the firm’s earnings from selling apps, books, movies and games still remain minuscule. Google has tried to change this by promoting developers to sell their apps for as low as ~10 in the country.  Carrier billing will either deduct the amount for an app bought on Google’s Play Store from a user’s currency balance in case of a prepaid connection and add it to their bill for postpaid users. The method will also allow users to navigate the tedious two-factor authentication process that comes along with paying using a card or net banking. While digital payments might have got a recent push, it’s unlikely Google will integrate any third-party wallets into its own store. Globally, the firm has Android Pay, its own digital wallet where users can add credit/debit cards and easily authenticate payments on their smartphones. Google has not indicated if it would bring Android Pay to India anytime soon.  Read More On Google | Play Store | App Purchases | Airtel | Vodafone | Carrier Billing PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements New to the stock market?

The company is planning to bring all the paid services under one spot. Previously, Google has announced that the billing for Google Drive storage will move on to the Play Store in January 2017. It seems that the migration is true for some of the Google Drive users. The users are even sharing their views and thoughts about the migration on social media. Recently, the company has sent emails for the change in its paid service. Let?s discover the entire story with TheBitBag. Google?s Email for the Google Drive Migration Recently, Google has sent an email to its users. The email reads that the company wanted to provide an improved experience to its users. And they are making minor changes in how the users manage their subscription. Furthermore, it reads that the Google Drive will be using Google Play to process the user’s’ subscription payment. The email even described the activities that uses can conduct once the account will be migrated to the Play Store.

Obviously smartphone integration is one avenue, but in the past couple of years, we’ve seen it integrated with Android Wear, the Apple Watch, and Alexa-powered speakers. Now it looks like we can add one more medium to the list in the form of Google Home. For those unfamiliar, Google Home is a speaker and Google’s answer to Amazon’s Echo devices and the Alexa platform. The device is powered by the new Google Assistant software which allows users to perform a variety of tasks using voice commands, and now it seems that controlling your Hyundai remotely is one of those tasks. Of course you can’t actually drive your car remotely, but rather it you should be able to access the same controls that other devices can. This means that you can start your car remotely, lock/unlock the doors, and even deliver Google Maps information to your car. Like we said these aren’t new features, but if you own the Google Home, then these are features that you can look forward to trying out with your Hyundai. However the good news is that Hyundai is planning more features that they’ll be adding in the future, but no word on when that will be taking place. Filed in Gadgets >Transportation.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Paid Search Content Marketing Social Media SEJ SUMMIT Tools Advertise Forecasting for the Future: How to Track Google Algorithm Updates SEO January 3, 2017 SEO Amanda DiSilvestroJanuary 3, 2017 VIP CONTRIBUTOR 698SHARES 1.9KREADS 698SHARES 1.9KREADS VIP CONTRIBUTORAmanda DiSilvestro 698SHARES 1.9KREADS Google changes its search algorithm about 500 to 600 times a year with about nine major updates in the past two years. Those in the SEO world are probably familiar with two of the most recent algorithm updates: Possum and Penguin 4.0, both of which were rolled out in September. As Ryan Shelly from our own Search Engine Journal stated earlier this year, there are three things to remember when an update happens: (1) don’t panic, (2) wait to react, and (3) read credible sources and make adjustments where necessary. The important thing to remember is while staying on top of algorithm updates is important, there are always other best practices to consider alongside these new updates. Why You Should Care Google algorithm updates are increasingly important to consider in the SEO world. While you do not need to pay attention to every little update that Google has (which quite frankly would be overwhelming and verging on impossible, especially for small business marketers), it is important to keep tabs on the top sites and most important updates. In reality, the most important updates are what impact businesses the most. Keeping on top of algorithm updates can help you address flaws and discover adjustments you might need to make to your digital marketing strategy. Many digital marketers start out by reading every little update and trying to recognize the impact, but the key is really knowing what is most important and seeking out guidance for how it might impact your business in consideration of the whole of Google Search engine impact. BUT…Algorithm Updates Aren’t Everything That being said, algorithm updates are not the end-all, be-all of SEO for company websites. It is important to remember that when you see a significant change in traffic, you need to consider all possibilities. Have you changed your normal behavior with content in some way (frequency of blogging, etc.)? Are you having issues with your mobile site or load times on your site because of new content you have added? While you absolutely want to consider how new algorithm updates might impact your business, you also want to make sure you don’t use them as a scapegoat for other flaws in your digital marketing strategy. How to Track Google Algorithm Updates With all things considered, below I’ll explain not only how to track algorithm updates, but also how to recognize what is most important in a constant feed of changes, adjustments, and new material. There are a few different sites that you can go to to see Google Algorithm updates: MozCast MozCast takes a unique approach to reporting the general “climate” of Google algorithm updates. With an overview page that looks much like a weather forecast, Moz has taken the approach of climate to tell marketers what is on the horizon. On a stormy day or a day with extreme temperatures, marketers know that there is a lot being stirred up in the Google algorithm. This is great because it is something that marketers can check daily, in a general sense, without getting hung up on small details. When you do see a stormy day on the horizon, that is when you know you should keep your eyes peeled on Google’s blog and on some of the other tools listed below. Moz Pro: Google Algorithm Change History As mentioned, changes in the algorithm can be major or minor. Marketers like to know the dates and information about algorithm changes so they can best plan for how this might impact their organic traffic and other aspects of search. Moz Pro has an entire page dedicated to Google Algorithm updates, along with links to Google articles on the updates, articles their writers have written, and articles by other sites that can be helpful in considering the change. As mentioned in the beginning, it is important to read from credible sources, and Moz has really taken this to heart in designing their stream of information. SEO Book If you are looking to get an overview of the history of Google algorithm updates from 2013 to present (and even for forecasting the future), then SEO Book is a great place to start. They highlight all the major algorithm update changes by year, and include the month and day of each change. As of now, they even have a forecast for January 2017. One of the things that is really nice about SEO Book is that they also include a concise explanation of each update. Panguin Tool Do you want to see how these Google algorithm updates directly impact your own organic traffic? The Panguin tool is free and allows you to look at these updates in relation to your own traffic through Google Analytics. If there have been any penalties to your traffic because of conflicts with new updates, you will easily be able to see them here! This tool is very user-friendly and gets you a report within seconds as well, so it has always been a personal favorite. Rank Ranger Rank Ranger is similar to the Moz page, with the exception that rather than having links to long-form content regarding the updates, a summary of each update is on the main page. This makes it easy to scroll through, read about the updates, and look at visual aids to help understand the information. A sidebar allows you to look at past updates dating back to 2000. So if you are into digital history, as well as getting a summary of the updates most recent and relevant to your work today, then Rank Ranger may be your new go-to for updates. Bonus: Follow Search Engine Journal on Twitter @sejournal. We cover every major update in real-time. The Takeaway There are many tools to monitor Google’s constantly changing algorithm updates, and most of them make it fairly easy to understand what the relationship to your organic traffic really is. While it is not necessary to monitor every update that Google puts out (especially since there are hundreds every year), it is important to understand the big changes and change your strategy accordingly as they happen.

It also probably isn’t making the top brass at Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) or Facebook Inc (FB) too happy. GOOG shareholders might be smiling, though. Google Home The first product that’ll come replete with this Google assistant is called Google Home. The 7 Best Tech Stocks … Of 2020! Frankly, it sounds pretty similar to the Amazon Echo, which comes with Amazon’s AI-powered virtual assistant, Alexa. The voice-activated Google Home… “…lets you enjoy entertainment, manage everyday tasks, and get answers from Google — all using conversational speech. With a simple voice command, you can ask Google Home to play a song, set a timer for the oven, check your flight, or turn on your lights.” This is definitely the GOOG answer to Amazon’s popular Echo; the Echo can also help you manage tasks, search the web, play songs, set timers and check flights. That turning on the lights thing, though — that’s new. Of course, Alphabet also owns Nest, the smart home company, so I expect there’ll be some nice synergies between Nest products and Google Home. Google Home will hit shelves later this year. Allo, GOOG’s Answer to Facebook Messenger The Google assistant will also come standard on GOOG’s new messaging app, Allo. Based on your phone number, Allo will allow you to communicate with any user, regardless of if they use Android or iOS. Not only can you have normal conversations with friends — with stickers and emojis of course — you can also call on the Google assistant to help you with day-to-day tasks, schedules and decisions like what movies to see (nearby), or where to go to dinner. Suggestions are personalized, and should become better as you use it more. The “Smart Reply” feature on Allo will even suggest responses to messages you receive, taking context into consideration. And if you’re worried about getting spied on, GOOG allows you to enable Incognito mode, which enables end-to-end encryption as well as expiring messages. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg probably isn’t pleased with this, since Facebook Messenger is a big part of his long-term vision, and he’s also putting a lot of stock in Facebook M, a personal AI assistant. Alphabet Inc: GOOGL Gets Into Ride-Hailing Despite Uber Investment GOOG noted that Allo will be available this summer, along with a video-calling app called Duo. And with I/O set to go on until Friday, we can expect more exciting announcements today and tomorrow. As of this writing, Robert Martin had no position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The South Korean firm appears to be going big on robots this year, in an attempt to, in its words "showcase LG innovations in artificial intelligence." Perhaps the most exciting new addition in this new robot lineup is the 'Hub Robot', which looks to be the company's answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Related: CES 2017 The new device will apparently "double as a smart home gateway and a personal assistant for consumers," which is essentially what Amazon and Google's alternatives do. LG announced the Hub Robot along with some other robotic companions, one of which has been designed to help users with gardening. The company also says it will launch "models designed for commercial use in public spaces such as airports and hotels to help improve the traveler’s experience". LG's press conference, set to get underway at 4pm GMT tomorrow (Jan 4), will see the robots properly unveiled, which should no doubt yield further details. Related: Amazon Echo According to the firm's announcement, the new robots will use "powerful analytical processing power... to navigate complex environments and decipher the most efficient and effective path to accomplish tasks". There's no word on when the new devices will actually be made available, as the company says it's merely "previewing" the robots at CES. That said, we're hoping to hear something during the conference on possible release dates and pricing, so stay tuned for the latest.

The collaboration aims to create the next generation of connected car systems using the Android platform. FCA and Google will be showing off the collaboration at CES in the form of an integration of Android and the FCA Uconnect 8.4-inch connected system for cars. Don't Miss: NES Classic Alternatives are Cheaper The new system will be shown off at CES 2017 inside a Chrysler 300 sedan, FCA says that the display will show the power of combining Uconnect with Android and its open platform and ecosystem. "This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction," says Chris Barman, Head of Electrical Engineering, FCA. "With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications." The Uconnect system runs Android 7.0 Nougat and supports core infotainment features including radio and comfort controls. The system is also designed to be compatible with Android applications. Specifically the demonstration at CES will show off how the system operates with Pandora, Spotify, NPR One, Google Assistant, Google Maps, and Pocket Casts.

But thanks to Qualcomm who couldn't keep it to itself, we know everything about the second commercial Project Tango phone. Qualcomm, on its official blog, revealed information about the upcoming AR phone touting the importance of the processor in the making of the phone. The Zenfone AR will be a follow-up to the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first to sport Google's Project Tango camera which uses a complex camera tech combined with a bunch of sensors to augment the reality around you. Qualcomm's reveal was backed by notorious leakster Evan Blass who provided image renders of both the front and the back of the phone. While the front looks like a standard Zenfone, the back contains a monstrous camera stack. From what we know, the Zenfone AR will be powered by the Snapdragon 821, which although is now a generation older, powers phones like the Google Pixel, Xiaomi Mi Mix and the OnePlus 3T. Moreover, it will also be Daydream ready, making it the first phone to support both Project Tango and Daydream. Daydream is Google's platform for accessing virtual reality content. Qualcomm doesn't go into the detailed specifications of the phone but was proud enough to highlight that the Zenfone AR will function better than the Lenovo's Phab2 Pro which was powered by a Snapdragon 652. Also, thanks to the Snapdragon 821, the Zenfone AR will support the entire Google's VR suite of apps including Street View, YouTube in addition to apps like Netflix, HBO and Hulu. The chipmaker also notified that all future 800 series and 600 series processors will support Project Tango. The official unveiling is slated for January 4th.

Google recently launched their own efforts with Google WiFi, and it seems that Linksys has no interest in giving up their market share to the company. This is why it isn’t surprising to see Linksys announce the Velop Whole Home WiFi system that CES 2017. If you live in a relatively small home, like a studio or 1-2 bedroom apartment, there’s a good chance that you could get away with having a single wireless router. However if you live in a large house with 2 floors or more, then this is where it gets tricky and it is also where Linksys’ Velop system comes into play. The setup process appears to be pretty simple and you basically set up the routers around the home to create a mesh network to envelope the whole area with WiFi. Linksys boasts that they use a Tri-Band solution that resolves bottlenecking, and is also supposed to outperform traditional router and range extender combos, thus providing users with optimal connectivity all the time. It comes with an accompanying smartphone app that lets users control their network remotely. It also works with Amazon’s Alexa platform where you can use voice commands to get it to perform certain tasks, such as enabling/disabling guest WiFi. If the Linksys Velop sounds like something you might be interested in, a single device will set you back $200. A 2-pack will retail for $350, while a 3-pack will go for $500. Filed in Gadgets >Home.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español CNET Computer Accessories Networking Linksys Velop Whole Home Wi-Fi system Linksys Velop Wi-Fi system aims to be the Eero killer January 3, 2017 4:00 AM PST The Velop comes in three identical units. Dong Ngo/CNET If the Google Wifi competes with the Eero by being much less expensive, Belkin's first Wi-Fi system, the Linksys Velop, intends to beat them both by having more powerful hardware. This new system, released today at CES 2017 in Las Vegas, carries the same hefty price as that of the Eero at launch: $500 for a set of three identical units or $200 for a single unit (you can also get two for $350.) That price converts to about £405 or AU$685 for the set of three, £160 or AU$275 for a single unit or two for £285 or AU$480. So it doesn't come cheap. But it packs enough power to potentially double the real-world Wi-Fi speed. Powerful hardware with dedicated back-haul Like most Wi-Fi systems, you use one Velop unit as the main router, then place additional units around it - one or two rooms away - to wirelessly and automatically extend the Wi-Fi network. Each Velop unit is a powerful tri-band dual-stream (2x2) AC2200 router, compared to the AC1200 Wi-Fi standard used by both Google Wifi and the Eero. It has two 5GHz bands with up to 867 megabits per second each and one 2.4GHz band (up to 400Mbps). The router is powered by an integrated system on a chip that incorporates a quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 processor along with 4GB of flash memory, 512MB DDR3 system memory and a Bluetooth 4.0/LE radio for device setup. That's a lot of raw power. What special about the Velop is that when multiple units are used together, they dedicate one 5GHz band for the back-haul, or the job of wirelessly linking them together. In other words, the main router unit uses one band just to send the signal to a satellite unit, and the satellite uses one of its 5GHz band just for the job of receiving that signal. Then it uses the other two bands to rebroadcast the signal to clients. This minimizes the effect of signal loss, which always occurs when a band has to both receive and rebroadcast the Wi-Fi signal at the same time. The Velop is the second Wi-Fi system, the Netgear Orbi being the first, that employs a dedicated back-half band. But the Velop goes one step further than the Orbi by supporting dynamic frequency selection (DFS) allowing it to automatically pick the best channel or band at a given time to connect the hardware units and clients together. You can also link the Velop units together using network cables, which will completely eliminate signal loss and distance restriction -- something the Netgear Orbi so far hasn't allowed. All these mean one thing: fast Wi-Fi connection speed. Basically the Velop is fast enough to deliver ultra-fast internet connection of 400Mbps or even faster. Keep in mind that most existing Wi-Fi systems, like the Eero or Google Wifi, can deliver the full broadband speed of no more than 200Mbps. Each Velop unit is a powerful AC2200 router that has two auto-sensing (LAN/WAN) Gigabit network ports. Dong Ngo/CNET Feature packed The Velop comes with a Linksys app for iOS and Android for both the setup process and ongoing management. It also comes with a host of cool features, including: Spot Finder: Using the Linksys app, the Velop will recommend the best placement for additional satellite units to deliver the best performance. Linksys XConnect: Sensitive information, such as passwords, will be encrypted and secure when passed between hardware units. Amazon Alexa Cloud Integration: You can use Alexa to control your home network, turn the Guest nerwork on and off or verbally request the Wi-Fi networks' passwords. Future Alexa skills are in development. Seamless Wi-Fi Experience: Velop promises seamless signal hand-off, allowing a connected client to roam from one hardware unit to another without interruption. Airtime fairness, Load balancing and device steering: When multiple clients with different Wi-Fi speed grades are connected to the Velop, they are treated differently based on their top speed. This allows all devices to connect at their best speeds. Wi-Fi coverage and availability Linksys says you can use a single Velop unit to cover a home of some 2,000 square feet, two units for up to 4,000 square feet and all three units for up to 6,000 square feet. The actual coverage depends on the layout of your home, obviously, but chances are you won't need more than three units. The Velop is available now and includes a three-year warranty, which is generous considering most routers and Wi-Fi systems come with just one year. All things considering this Wi-Fi system sure sounds promising. Check back after CES for the full review to see how its real-world performance pans out. Here's what else is happening at CES 2017.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google and FCA team up for Android-Uconnect integration By Rei Padla - January 3, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you happen to be at this year’s CES, you can discover yourself what the FCA and Google have been working on the past few months. A connected car system is something we’ve been dying to see and experience and looks like it’s happening soon. Thanks to the Android OS, its being open source makes it an ideal platform for OEMs and other companies to work on and actually have successful collaborations. At the CES in Las Vegas, the FCA and Google will be showcasing the Android-Uconnect integration that makes the 8.4-inch connected system more useful than ever. Android delivers user interface customization and automakers find it easy to manipulate. The result is a full-featured automotive infotainment system where most Android apps can run. The FCA will be offering hands-on demonstrations in Las Vegas this week. Beginning January 5 until the 8th, you can check out the Android-powered Uconnect connected vehicle system installed in a Chrysler 300 sedan. FCA’s Head of Electrical Engineering Chris Barman says Google and FCA’s collaboration did them good. He said, “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” The Uconnect is already powered by Android 7.0 Nougat so it can work with even the latest smartphones. The name of the game is connectivity and this compatibility with Android makes the Uconnect more useful with Google Maps, Google Assistant, and apps more frequently used while inside a vehicle such as Spotify, Pandora, Pocket Casts, and NPR One.

This year’s CES begins Thrusday. Published: 15:47 January 3, 2017 Bloomberg   SMALL MEDIUM LARGE SAN FRANCISCO: Car electronics supplier Delphi Automotive Plc went coast-to-coast in 2015 in a self-driving Audi Q5 sport-utility vehicle to prove the autonomous automobile had arrived. Now, Delphi is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, the company will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. “The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, “Look what it can do,” ‘ said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of advanced engineering. “This year, the discussion is all about the path to production.” Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it’s in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens Jan. 5, the talk won’t be about proving technology — it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. “We’re close to bringing this to a lot of people,” John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. “We’re kind of at an inflection point.” At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21 per cent more than last year. Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomy business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42 billion by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. “CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era,” said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield.” Prius Problem One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. “Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer’s mind,” Wakefield said. “Then when you come out with one, it’s like, ‘Oh, you make one, too?” ‘ Google’s self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than 2 million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn’t yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Unlike traditional automakers, Alphabet’s businesses tend to focus on recurring revenue streams, such as search ads. Google’s Project Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. “Google’s playbook here is well-tested,” said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer of Zendrive, a transportation data start-up, who formerly worked on Android. “They understand how to use the platform to create dominance.” Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the back seat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which said last week its test-fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. Acclimating Consumers The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. “Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure,” Wakefield said. “As they gain confidence and think, ‘Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,’ GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise.” It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. “The high cost isn’t solved yet,” Wakefield said. “There’s not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two.” Safety Improvements The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “It took air bags 15 years to get high penetration in cars,” Jonas said. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla — which doesn’t exhibit at shows such as CES — may be the biggest accelerant for autonomy. Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which puts pressure on other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. “Tesla is being a disrupter,” Wakefield said. “Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product.” Regulatory Changes Autonomy also is getting a boost from US regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. “Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule,” said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now “you’re going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers.” For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70 per cent, De Vos said. “The economics are really compelling,” said De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi’s driverless car in Las Vegas. “After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers.” More from Technology Phone hacking company falls victim to hackers WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping Nintendo Switch to launch March 3 for $299 Antitrust lawsuit against Apple revived Adoption of mobile apps in Gulf gains traction Facebook’s virtual reality foray derided Alphabet winds down Titan drone internet project Will Alexa become the OS for virtual assistant? tags from this storyUnited States follow this tag on MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsTechnology tagsUnited States follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN+ MGN FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01WhatsApp vulnerable to snooping 02Individuals can access VPNs in UAE 03Phone hacking company falls victim to hackers Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 Play Britain is open for business Sep 20, 2016 Play Emirati who created 2 successful companies Jan 02, 2016 Play Tour of the DWTC kitchens May 18, 2015 8Images World Future Energy Summit in Abu Dhabi Jan 18, 2010 8Images Where to live in Downtown Dubai Mar 15, 2011 11Images Etihad Airways offers residence in the sky May 04, 2014 10Images Apple unveils Nike+ smartwatch Oct 29, 2016 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Most Popular on Gulf News Speeding driver crashes into parked car, dies Revealed: World's most powerful passports 9 ways your own home could kill you Mum reunited with abused baby in Saudi Arabia Dubai retail developers prepare for mega year Businessman donates Dh370m to charity Mohammad Bin Zayed visits UAE ambassador Revealed: Top 25 universities in the world Female Indonesian workers come to UAE Close Recommended For You 26 dead in new Brazil prison massacrePUBLISHED ON Jan 16, 2017 US spy chief tells Trump to watch his mouthPUBLISHED ON Jan 16, 2017 9 ways your own home could kill youPUBLISHED ON Jan 11, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

The year in tech starts here. It increasingly looks like the future of home Wi-Fi involves placing not one, but two or three routers throughout our homes to get the best possible signal. Last year, we saw these multi-unit systems from Eero, Luma, Plume, Google, and Netgear (among others). And to kick off this year, Linksys — one of the router world's old guards — is getting into the game. Linksys is today unveiling Velop, its strangely named take on a multi-unit router system. You're meant to place two or three Velop routers throughout a home, and for doing so, Linksys promises you'll get the best Wi-Fi around. And "best" is an important part of the pitch here, because Velop is one of the most expensive systems out there, running up to $499 for a three-unit bundle. For that price, Linksys claims you'll get even faster speeds from Velop than you would from Netgear's Orbi, which currently sits on top of the pack, by far, when it comes to speed. Linksys Like Orbi, Velop is a tri-band system (it has three Wi-Fi radios in it) that's always dedicating a single band to communication between router units, preventing some of the speed drop-off seen by two-band competitors like Google Wifi. Linksys claims it's able to provide even better speeds than Orbi by using different bands to connect different router units, rather than locking down a specific band and using that no matter what. Where will these look unobtrusive? But if speed is the upside of a tri-band system, size is the downside. All of the two-band systems so far have been small pucks and boxes that could be subtly placed on a shelf. But, like Orbi, Velop is composed of big, noticeable routers. Velop isn't nearly as enormous as Orbi's weird potteryesque design, but its units are tall and have sloped sides that make them impossible to lay down flat. They're going to stand out wherever you put them, and while I wouldn't say they're necessarily ugly, they do remind me of the speakers that shipped with Gateway PCs in the mid-’90s... so, yeah. It's worth keeping in mind that the speeds Velop promises to deliver won't be necessary for everyone. Even a two-band system like Google Wifi is able to deliver speeds fast enough to stream 4K video. And if the internet speeds you're paying for aren't above 100Mbps (and statistically, they’re probably not), Linksys' speed advantage may not make a difference. Linksys In addition to speed, Linksys is also hoping it can win on ease-of-use, which is going to be a tougher battle. Velop's setup is handled entirely through a mobile app. It's also integrating with Alexa to let basic router functions be completed by voice, though so far, that's limited to turning the guest network on and off. Owners will also be able to ask Alexa to read their Wi-Fi password aloud, which'll be helpful since everyone inevitably forgets it (this feature can also be disabled for what seem like obvious security reasons). Speed isn’t everything Our current pick for favorite multi-unit Wi-Fi system — Google Wifi — wins for its ease of use, not its speed, which means that Linksys really has to deliver here, especially given its price. Google Wifi is only $299 for a three-pack, while Velop is $499. Linksys says a three-pack is only going to be necessary for a large, four-or-so bedroom home. A smaller home, around 2,000 to 4,000 square feet, should be able to get by with a two-pack of Velop routers, which it's selling for $349.99. You'll also be able to buy a single Velop unit, either as an add-on or a standalone router, for $199.99, which is supposed to be good for up to 2,000 square feet of space. Velop is available for preorder today and will be in stores on January 15th. Or if you happen to be in Vegas for CES and for whatever reason want to buy a Wi-Fi router system right now, you'll be able to pick one up early at local Best Buys, which should be only half as crowded as the convention center.

Some publishers are unsure Newsis via AP file photo mail print View all comments Tweet By DAISUKE WAKABAYASHI - - Published: 7:35 PM, January 3, 2017 SAN FRANCISCO — Last month, Mr Federico Viticci, who runs MacStories, a news site devoted to Apple and its products, made a change in how the site publishes articles for mobile gadgets. MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile webpages, called AMP. Mr Viticci said MacStories’s pages loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also didn’t like the idea of Google’s obscuring his site’s links — with AMP, they read google.com instead of macstories.net — in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Mr Viticci wrote on Twitter. Mr Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship some web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP, in October 2015, it said the new format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile websites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile webpages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier webpages. What’s more, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That’s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher’s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher. “It looks like a Google story,” said Mr Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP to prioritise speed and that it wanted to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile webpage. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said Mr David Besbris, Google’s vice president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company — which created the internet’s most valuable property by organising the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for “Donald Trump” on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organisations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google’s network. Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 per cent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter. Since AMP’s launch, the open-source project has won over many big publishers who praise Google’s responsiveness. They say readers are engaging more with ads on AMP because they actually get to the stories and it’s a better experience. There are more than 600 million pages running AMP on more than 700,000 domains, including publishers such as The New York Times and non-media sites like eBay. Mr David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 per cent of mobile web content was on AMP. Yet Mr Gehring also said Google suffered from “tone deafness” when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic. That tone deafness has rubbed some publishers the wrong way. In October, the software developer Alex Kras created a stir when he wrote a post titled “Google May Be Stealing Your Mobile Traffic”, in which he recounted what had happened when he used AMP on his technology blog. After he enabled AMP on his WordPress publishing software, Mr Kras said, his old posts displayed google.com and there was no easy way to redirect readers to his own site. “It made me feel like my site wasn’t my own,” Mr Kras said. He later said the title of his blog post was inaccurate, but stood by his concerns that AMP could cost publishers mobile traffic, an assertion Google denies. Mr Kras said smaller publishers had more to lose if they used AMP, since big publishers have more name recognition and readers are more likely to remember them as the source of a story. “Little guys like myself don’t have this luxury,” he wrote in another blog post after meeting with Google officials. Still, Mr Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. “For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,” he said. Google may be starting to acknowledge some publishers’ concerns. Last month, Google told Search Engine Land that it planned to make changes to AMP in 2017 to make it easier for publishers to offer their own links and for readers to be redirected to their sites. Google did not elaborate on its plans. Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google. “Google has been a good partner,” said Mr Mark Silverstein, head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. “When they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.” THE NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most Tech READ COMMENTED ‘Smart’ solar palm trees power Wi-Fi, phones in Dubai ‘Sextortion’, a new cyber crime, is common: Study ‘PCs will not go away in the next five or 10 years’ ‘PCs not dead yet’ ‘MyShake’ app, a personal tsunami warning system Yahoo plans to shrink board, change name to Altaba after Verizon deal The best tech to help you sleep Smartphone, Internet use at record high in US: Survey Robots will take jobs, but not as fast as some fear: McKinsey report Outrage over Indian flag doormats on sale on Amazon New Facebook project aims to fight the spread of ‘fake news’ Japan researchers warn of fingerprint theft from ‘peace’ sign E-waste rising dangerously in Asia: UN Creative control Bionic woman: Chinese robot turns on the charm Inside Today World Beijing will 'take off the gloves' if Trump continues on Taiwan: China Daily Trump's offer to Putin: an end to sanctions for nuclear arms cut - London Times Trump says NATO is obsolete but still 'very important to me' South Korea former opposition leader holds lead in presidential favorites poll Stark inequality: Oxfam says 8 men as rich as half the world Business Singapore to prop up South-east Asia’s muted IPO market in 2017 Key Samsung shares steady, market awaits South Korea prosecution decision on leader World's eight richest as wealthy as half humanity, Oxfam tells Davos Luxottica and Essilor to merge in $53 billion deal: FT Job cuts, fewer flights?

Published on January 03, 2017. Most Popular YouTube video bloggers and other independent producers have been a growing part of marketing content creation for brands, sometimes in deals brokered by third parties. Now Google itself is getting in on the action, linking YouTube video production talent with brands and their agencies to produce video ads for the site. Through an initiative called YouTube Labs, Google, working with influencer network AwesomenessTV, recently linked L'Oreal brands Maybelline, Essie and Dark & Lovely with YouTube creators, who also worked with agencies Code & Theory and Tag Creative. The result is a series of videos for each brand. L'Oreal USA had exclusive U.S. use of YouTube Labs for 2016 in what Kirk Perry, Google president-client and agency relations, describes as an alpha test, though the model will be open to other companies this year. In Europe, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Mondelez have tested the approach. The effort moves Google into a sort of talent brokerage, linking content creators on YouTube with brands. And in the case of the L'Oreal brands, that didn't mean hooking them up with beauty bloggers with which they're already familiar in many cases through content or promotional deals. Rather it meant bringing creative talent from others areas, such as travel blogger Raya Encheva, together with brands. Google doesn't make any commission or fee from the arrangement, Mr. Perry said, though the content creators do, and Google benefits from paid advertising revenue for placement of the videos on its site. There's no restriction on brands using the videos elsewhere, such as Facebook, other publishers or their own sites. The effort came out of brainstorming sessions earlier last year on "the next generation of content," said L'Oreal USA Chief Marketing Officer Marie Gulin-Merle. "The idea was to put in one room in a beauty hackathon the YouTube creators, our marketing teams and our agencies. We would behave as publishers and invent the web series." Howard Collinge, group creative director at Code and Theory, which worked on the videos for Essie and Maybelline with the YouTube creators, said he doesn't see the outside help as a threat. "This was a really great collaboration," he said. "From the creative side, I think it gave us a lot of freedom." The emphasis was on speed, with the agency going straight to production once the scripts were approved, guided by insights from YouTube creators and what they knew about the market," he said. "But we essentially wrote scripts and went and shot them. So we used them as a springboard. We had a lot of creative freedom to do what we thought was the right thing." The brief was simple, Mr. Collinge said: "Be entertaining and really get their attention and be relevant. That's a great brief for any agency. It was a very experimental lab approach that felt a lot freer and more fun, nothing like a typical ad agency where you get briefed and have six weeks to work and then research and go shoot a commercial." Ms. Gulin-Merle also describes the process as "less linear than before," replacing the usual process involving copy testing. "It was a fast and furious way of working with one motto: Better done than perfect. It's OK if you don't take another week to polish the content. You put it online and optimize from there and listen to the conversations and feedback from the consumer." Among the ideas in the series was to tap into the stories behind the names of Essie nail polishes, she said. One video tells a story behind "Jamaica Me Crazy," named after an annoying vacation-intensive coworker and her trip to the island. It's less clear if Google getting involved as a conduit between YouTube creators and brands helps companies like Gen.Video, which has done the same thing albeit with somewhat different projects for such players as Procter & Gamble's Olay. "This is a logical and inevitable evolution of Google's facilitation role in the YouTube marketplace," said Jessica Thorpe, president of Gen.Video, in a statement. "It will put added pressure on companies (platforms and agencies) to provide more services than simply matching to support and amplify the impact of influencer video." Gen. Video is already doing that, she said, in part by facilitating distribution of videos created by the producers it represents on e-commerce sites. "The players that only provide exchange-based matching will quickly die out, and those that can differentiate will thrive as leveraging influencers becomes more universal," she said. But she said Google's involvement will "be another catalyst for growth for the video generation." "I don't think we compete in any way, shape or form with the Gen.Videos of the world or the Tongals of the world," said Google's Mr. Perry. "We obviously have a little insight on the YouTube business and the creator ecosystem. We also have access to a lot of data and analytics about where consumers are and what they're watching. So we have that unique insight others wouldn't have." While Google gets no money directly from making the introductions, the idea, he said, is an investment to make brands more comfortable so they'll want to reach consumers on Google media. ~ ~ ~ CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article did not note that Google had worked with influencer network AwesomenessTV to link L'Oreal brands with YouTube creators. It also implied that Code & Theory worked on videos for Maybelline's Dark & Lovely brand; those were handled by Tag Creative.

The upcoming Android smartphone will officially be the second Google Tango phone following 2015’s Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Qualcomm revealed the Zenfone AR on a blog post earlier today which carried a publishing date of Jan. 4, according to GSM Arena. The blog post has now been taken down and it seems as though someone within the company inadvertently published the post in advance. The blog post detailed that the Asus Zenfone AR will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 processor, the very same chipset that’s in Google’s Pixel phones and Asus’s own Zenfone 3. A lot of people were expecting that the handset would come with the new Snapdragon 835, but Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 821will be enough for the upcoming handsets’ Tango features, according to 9To5Google. Although it’s already been known previously that the Zenfone AR will be Tango-enabled, the blog post also revealed that it will be Daydraam VR-ready as well. This will make the Zenfone AR the very first handset to support both of Google’s Tango and Daydream software for Android. For the uninitiated, Google Tango is a tech platform that allows users to map out indoor environments through a smartphone’s dual-camera setup. The software uses augmented reality technology allowing a smartphone to see the world and detect distances without using on GPS and other external signals. Daydream VR on the other hand is Google’s own virtual reality platform which is baked right in the Android mobile operating system. Following Qualcomm’s accidental reveal of the Asus Zenfone AR, leaker Evan Blass also shared a press render of the upcoming handset on his Twitter page. Up front, the handset looks a lot like the Zenfone 3 with the exception of the physical home button and the Asus logo just beneath the earpiece. On the back, the Tango-enabled dual cameras and its array of sensors are clearly seen. Asus is expected to officially reveal the Zenfone AR at CES 2017 which kicks off this Wednesday in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Here's what we expect to see. Phones, Carriers, and Mobile Chipsets AT&T and T-Mobile both have major press conferences at CES. AT&T's presser is usually about connected devices and the Internet of Things rather than phones, but expect some details on 5G, as well. T-Mobile says it's having an UnCarrier announcement, which usually means some big service plan improvement. On the chipset side, the big news will undoubtably be Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, the mysterious 10-nanometer processor that will be in many flagship phones next year. Qualcomm has a press conference, a keynote, and a drinks event, so clearly, it has a lot to say. Mediatek will probably focus on cars, while Intel and Nvidia have said they're going to talk about cars, AI, VR, and 5G. None of those other companies are anticipated to announce a discrete chip with the impact on the phone world that the Snapdragon 835 will have. None of the biggest US phone makers have major announcements scheduled for CES. LG will probably do its G6 at Mobile World Congress in late February, although it may have some midrange devices at CES. HTC has an announcement scheduled for Jan. 12, after the show, and it looks like the Samsung Galaxy S8 is now scheduled for April. We haven't heard a peep from Motorola, and Apple is never at CES. If it does an update for iPhone SE, it'll probably be in March. That leaves the phone portion of CES, as before, mostly to Chinese and Taiwanese vendors with smaller roles in the US market. We expect the Asus Zenfone AR, the second phone with Google's Tango AR technology, to appear at CES. Honor will probably have an update to last year's low-cost Honor 5X. ZTE will offer an update on its CSX crowd-sourced, sticky, eye-tracking phone. Alcatel may have something, too. Cars People always say CES is about big TVs—and it is—but over the years CES has become a key event for the automotive industry. Every major auto vendor attends to show and although they don't always debut new models, they almost always launch new technologies and services. This year will be no different. It isn't confirmed, but there are rumors that Chrysler will reveal an all-electric version of its Pacifica minivan, a separate, self-driving version of which (below) is already racking up mileage with Waymo (from Google parent company Alphabet). While most vendors are busy automating their vehicles, Honda is busy emoting. Honda will show off the NeuV, a car that includes an artificial intelligence engine that can generate emotions. (Skeptics credit Volkswagen's Herbie the Love Bug as the real pioneer in this space.) How this will enhance the mobile experience remains to be seen. BMW will show off its next generation in-vehicle control system, HoloActive Touch. As the name suggests, it offers a mix of heads-up display, augmented reality, and plain old touch screens with haptic feedback to navigate the in-vehicle interface. Last year, Faraday Future made a splash with the FFZERO1 all-electric supercar, but that prototype was never meant to be commercially available. This year, Faraday plans to show a vehicle that you might be able actually to buy. The big questions remain: What? When? And how much? (Telsa isn't scared yet.) Cameras and Drones CES is always hit or miss for camera announcements. Some years, we get a few entry-level models that do nothing to excite photography enthusiasts. Last year, Nikon decided to go big and drop two pro SLRs, the D5 and D500 at the show. What we do know is that Fujifilm, which has had a presence on the show floor in past years, won't be at the show this year. Olympus, which hasn't shown at CES in some time, isn't holding on-site meetings with press, as it has in the past. And, like last year, Sigma is skipping the show. I'd expect to see some modest announcements from the usual suspects—Canon, Nikon, and Sony—but nothing major. Panasonic showed off a prototype of its forthcoming GH5 mirrorless model at Photokina, and I wouldn't be shocked to see more details at CES. For fans of aerial videography and photography, the major drone manufacturers—DJI, Parrot, and Yuneec—announced new products at previous shows. I'd expect them to have something new at CES, though with DJI, which also makes handheld gimbals, it might not be something that flies. TVs 4K is here to stay, and that means an incredibly shrinking market of 1080p HDTVs. Major TV manufacturers will all but completely phase out HDTVs in favor of 4K models even for the budget tiers, and high dynamic range (HDR) will stand as the premium feature to make more expensive TVs appealing. Don't expect to see many record-breaking huge TVs at the show, but bigger will become the norm. Sixty-five inches stands as the current standard for large TVs, but 70- and 75-inch models will start to come down in price enough for them to be feasible for users looking for really large TVs without spending five digits. Audio Totally wireless earphones have boomed in the last year with the Bragi Dash, Samsung Gear IconX, and Apple AirPods. Now this new headphone form factor will get polished and more widely adopted. Expect many more completely wire-free earphones to show up at CES, and don't be surprised if Bragi, Samsung, or SOL Republic hint at improved second-generation versions of their own models. PCs It looks like gaming will be the word on everyone's lips in the PC market, driven by Nvidia's amazing new Pascal graphics line and Intel's evolutionary Kaby Lake processors. These components are allowing for more power than ever in increasingly streamlined laptops, and manufacturers are itching to make the most of the hardware. More gaming power also goes hand in hand with virtual reality, and now that the main VR headsets are on the market, the biggest companies are eager to roll out systems that cater to early adopters and fence sitters. General Windows 10 headsets are on the way, too, which should mean gaming-grade components will come to a wider swath of systems than before. Outside of power-focused systems, expect the multi-function revolution to continue; 2-in-1 design is spreading to every other PC category, from business systems to ultraportables. Laptops will get thinner, continue to adopt USB-C (some leaving traditional USB behind altogether), and attain ever-longer battery life thanks to the new processors. Expect updates to award-winning lines from the likes of Dell, Lenovo, and Acer. Virtual Reality VR has come with less than an explosion but more than a flash in the pan. All of the major virtual reality players we've been waiting for (Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, Samsung Gear VR, Google Daydream) have arrived, and now we need to see if they keep improving hardware and software offerings to make the market feasible. Meanwhile, Microsoft is working with several manufacturers for its own ecosystem of Windows 10 VR headsets, and we could see the first looks at actual models at the show. As for non-VR gaming, CES isn't a big show for it. Don't expect any news on the Nintendo Switch, but the week after CES Nintendo itself will be holding a major preview event. Wearables and Fitness Gadgets It's been a rough year for wearables and fitness trackers. Ahead of CES, the big elephant in the room is how companies plan to reverse the downward trend and bolster their fortunes. Whether it's diving deeper with personal training software, more specific tracking (e.g., exactly how many burpees can you do in a minute?), or sleeker fashion options, look for companies to try distinguishing themselves from their competition. Speaking of which, Hug Innovations is set to show off the world's first gesture-control smartwatch, while Under Armor will deliver a keynote about its vision of "connected fitness." Just don't expect Fitbit to be anything but mum on its recent Pebble acquisition. Smart Home Between Alexa and Mark Zuckerberg's new buddy Jarvis, the smart home is looking a lot less futuristic. In 2016 we saw a focus on home security, so it's no surprise that this year brings even more smart alarm systems, video doorbells, and security cameras. But the biggest challenge remains making the Internet of Things devices talk to each other seamlessly across platforms. To that end, keep an eye out for companies showing off their solutions of how to integrate all these connected devices into a more intuitive user experience. And of course, there's always the oddball "smart" gizmo like toothbrushes, umbrellas, and even mattresses. Back to top Previous : The Best of CES 2016: Where Are They Now?

Here, an old logo of U.S. car manufacturer Chrysler is seen at a 1941 Royal car in Zurich, Switzerland, Aug. 17, 2016. Photo: REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann Google, after abandoning its self-driving car plans (or rather, hiving them off to another company, Waymo, under its parent Alphabet), is still working on automobile software. And in an announcement Monday, Fiat Chrysler revealed it had been working with the technology giant to develop its Uconnect car system using the Android platform. The new version of Uconnect, to be showcased at the upcoming electronics extravaganza, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2017, in Las Vegas, is powered by Android 7.0 Nougat. It will allow Fiat Chrysler vehicles to seamlessly integrate with popular Google products like Google Assistant and Google Maps, as well as Android apps such as Pandora, Spotify, NPR One and Pocket Casts. Chris Barman, head of electrical engineering at Fiat Chrysler, said in the statement: “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction. With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” Related Stories Georgia Appeals Court Upholds $40M In Damages In Jeep Crash, Fire That Killed 4 year old Google's Waymo Unveils Self-Driving Minivans At CES 2017, the companies will give visitors to the Fiat Chrysler booth a hands-on demonstration of the new Uconnect system — an 8.4-inch connected car system featuring Android Nougat inside a Chrysler 300 sedan — which will include comfort controls along with core infotainment features such as radio. Patrick Brady, director of Android engineering at Google, said: “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way. This collaboration with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” The Fiat Chrysler exhibit will be at #6306 in the North Hall at the Las Vegas Convention Center from Jan. 5-8.

And as it turns out the third largest US automaker has decided to hit the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas with another Google collaboration – a project for a concept that acts as a preview for the company’s upcoming infotainment system software. The prototype integration will be shown at the CES event in Las Vegas – a Chrysler 300 has been refitted with a different version of the 8.4-inch Uconnect display – this time the system being based on the Google Android 7.0 Nougat. FCA added the current Uconnect infotainment system’s feel and functionality would be retained, but with the added bonus of integrating features and apps available for Android devices. The Android open-source operating system is the dominant element for tablets and smartphones – and might look to become relevant in the auto world as well. The prototype at CES will demonstrate how the system can control traditional things such as climate control and the radio, and then allowing full functionality with apps such as Google Maps, Pandora, Spotify, NPR One, Pocket Casts, and Google Assistant. “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” commented Chris Barman, FCA head of electrical engineering.   Related Tweet Share Share 2017 NAIAS: This is the 2018 Kia Stinger January 11, 2017 2017 NAIAS: 2018 Toyota Camry January 10, 2017 2017 NAIAS: 2018 Honda Odyssey is the techy family hauler January 10, 2017 2017 NAIAS: Nissan Vmotion 2.0 concept January 10, 2017 2017 NAIAS: Audi Q8 concept arrives in Detroit January 10, 2017 Recent Posts A Koenigsegg employee has envisioned the Regera as a Prince tribute Manhart Racing makes the BMW M2 more hardcore than an M5 Report – Chevrolet Cruze diesel might get magical 50 mpg rating There’s an EV acceleration battle going around town Report – 2020 Ford Bronco getting a removable roof Most Popular Now List of World record highways 10 Busiest Junctions in the world McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule McLaren denies Dennis to challenge new FIA rule Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Jackie Stewart tells Mercedes to quit F1 Hamilton-to-Ferrari rumours fire in Bahrain Ferrari re-opens door to working with Red Bull 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show LIVE: 2016 Skoda Superb Combi… Bottas signs deal to replace Raikkonen – report Latest Galeries Receive Our Newsletter Subscribe to RSS Follow us on Social Media News All the news ordered by time Industry Technology Tuners Videos Safety Car Crashes Concepts Spy Photos IN DEPTH Motor Shows Motor Sport Test Drive Editors Choice Automakers Acura Alfa Romeo Aston Martin Audi Bentley BMW Bugatti Buick Cadillac Caterharm Chevrolet Chrysler Citroen Dacia Dodge Ferrari Fiat Fisker Ford GMC Holden Honda Hummer Hyundai Infiniti Jaguar Jeep Kia Koenigsegg Lamborghini Lancia Land Rover Lexus Lotus Lincoln McLaren Maserati Mazda Mayback Mercede-Benz Mini Mitshubishi Nissan Pagani Peugeot Porsche Opel RAM Renault Rolls Royce Saab Saturn Scion Seat Skoda Spyker Subaru Suzuki Tata Tesla Vauxhall Volkswagen Toyota Volvo Others Copyright © 2017 — INAUTONEWS.

At CES 2017, the car company announced a new partnership with Google to add voice control for your car through the Google Home. That means that various Blue Link remote access functions like starting your car or unlocking the doors can be controlled simply by talking to your Google Home. Additionally, Blue Link supports Google Maps, so Home can look up addresses using Google’s mapping data, deliver the results, and send directions straight to your car all through voice control. None of this is exactly new, per say — Hyundai’s offered similar support through smartphones and smartwatches for a while, and we’ve even seen an Alexa-controlled Tesla hack. That said, Hyundai’s implementation is one of the first official integrations for controlling a car with a digital home assistant. Additionally, Hyundai claims that it’ll be adding more features before it launches the Action for Google Home, but currently isn’t offering an estimate as to when it will be available.

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechNews Driverless cars finally steer near showrooms 2017-01-03 12:17 - Keith Naughton and Mark Bergen Post a comment 0 share: Waymo Pacifica minivan RELATED ARTICLES Singapore becomes first to try out public self-driving taxis Elon Musk readies Tesla 'masterplan' after autopilot crash Michigan - Car electronics supplier Delphi Automotive Plc went coast-to-coast in 2015 in a self-driving Audi Q5 sport-utility vehicle to prove the autonomous automobile had arrived. Now, Delphi is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, the company will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. READ: Honda in talks with Google on self-drive tech The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. “The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, ‘Look what it can do,’" said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of advanced engineering. “This year, the discussion is all about the path to production." Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it’s in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens January 5, the talk won’t be about proving technology - it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. “We’re close to bringing this to a lot of people,” John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. “We’re kind of at an inflection point.” At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21% more than last year. READ: Apple reveals autonomous vehicle ambitions Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomy business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42bn by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. “CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era,” said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield. Prius Problem One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. “Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer’s mind,” Wakefield said. “Then when you come out with one, it’s like, ‘Oh, you make one, too?”’ Google’s self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than 2 million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn’t yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Unlike traditional automakers, Alphabet’s businesses tend to focus on recurring revenue streams, such as search ads. Google’s Project Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. “Google’s playbook here is well-tested,” said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer of Zendrive, a transportation data startup, who formerly worked on Android. “They understand how to use the platform to create dominance.” Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the backseat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which said last week its test-fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. Acclimating Consumers The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. “Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure,” Wakefield said. “As they gain confidence and think, ‘Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,’ GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise.” It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. “The high cost isn’t solved yet,” Wakefield said. “There’s not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two.” Safety Improvements The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “It took air bags 15 years to get high penetration in cars,” Jonas said. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla - which doesn’t exhibit at shows such as CES - may be the biggest accelerant for autonomy. Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which puts pressure on other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. READ: Uber keeps self-driving cars rolling “Tesla is being a disrupter,” Wakefield said. “Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product.” Regulatory Changes Autonomy also is getting a boost from US regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. “Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule,” said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now “you’re going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers." For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70%, De Vos said. “The economics are really compelling,” said De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi’s driverless car in Las Vegas. “After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers.” Read Fin24's top stories trending on Twitter: Fin24’s top stories Read more about: volvo  |  self-driving cars  |  autonomous cars share: More In This Category Hail Uber, book restaurants through Google Maps WhatsApp vulnerable to 'backdoor' spying - report MTN 'gives away' 50GB and 10 000 minutes every month Bitcoin price plunges as China probes exchange Most Popular Read WhatsApp vulnerable to 'backdoor' spying - report MTN 'gives away' 50GB and 10 000 minutes every month Hail Uber, book restaurants through Google Maps Will Apple's next iPhone be borderless?

On December 8, 2015, Asus confirmed its participation in CES 2017 and since that day, the company has been dropping hints on its new launches, especially the two smartphones—Zenfone AR and the new Zenfone Zoom. The company has only confirmed the former model, but the video teaser, which was released in mid-December showed the infinity '∞' symbol [ watch teaser at the bottom], an unmistakable sigil of the company's flagship camera-centric Zenfone Zoom, has led many to believe that Asus is ready with its successor. Also read: CES 2017: LG to showcase new line of AI-based Robots to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home at Las Vegas event Asus Zenfone AR: What we know so far In November 2016, the company's CEO confirmed that the Zenfone AR is actually the Google's second generation Project Tango phone -- with augmented reality features and 3D imaging technology -- which will be unveiled in January's CES 2017 event. There is no official word on hardware specifications, but it will come with advanced functionality and performance compared to Google's first-generation Project Tango-based phone Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, and will be reasonably priced. CES 2017: Asus releases new video teaser of Zenfone ARAsus via YouTube Just a few hours ago, Asus' chipset supply partner Qualcomm accidently posted a press release on its official blog revealing the Zenfone AR's processor details. Quickly realizing its faux pas, it took the webpage off the internet, but by then many blogs had managed to get a screen-shot of the page.

The survey showed that three-quarters of citizens believe that internet service providers such as Google and Facebook should not have the right to prevent access to their services if users refuse to store identifiers, such as cookies, on their equipment. There has been a wide practice of locating cookies which track computer users’ preferences and activities, without their consent or knowledge. Popular browsers like Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer placed them anonymously for years without alerting users. More recent practices, to put the onus on users to opt out, are equally invasive of privacy and data protection. However, three-quarters of industry, on the other hand, disagree. READ NEXT Dublin firm LogoGrab fights image fraud Online advertisers, in particular, say the proposals would upset the entire business model of the internet. The commission when it launched its Digital Single Market Strategy two years ago, which included the adoption of the general data protection regulation, was aware there was a danger the privacy of internet users could be abused. It led to an e-privacy directive review, which was aimed at reinforcing trust and security in digital services in the EU. The focus was on ensuring a high level of protection for citizens and a level playing field for all market players. Based on the consultation across EU states, the commission is now ready to issue a new legislative proposal on e-privacy. Without prejudice to the outcome of the evaluation, several policy issues have already emerged as key issues to be addressed in the review of the e-privacy directive. These include the need for new privacy rules on how internet platforms such as Google, Facebook and its WhatsApp subsidiary, and Microsoft and its Skype subsidiary track people online and then offer to target advertising to businesses. New rules are expected that will compel website and browser owners to gain the assent of users before bombarding them with advertising based on the profiles they have built up of these users. The commission is also probing the revenue that these internet platform owners derive from selling citizens’ profiles to companies who wish to sell goods and services, both online and in the high street. The commission is understood to be planning to introduce penalties for any breaches of the new e-privacy rules, including fines of 4% to 10% of the advertiser’s revenue. The move is considered by industry insiders as part of a wider attempt by Brussels to rein in big Silicon Valley corporations and their tax avoidance practices in Europe. It has already launched antitrust probes into Google and has, of course, ordered the Irish Government to collect €13bn in back taxes from Apple. In Google’s case, any fine could cost up to €6bn on current market sales and €2bn for Facebook. It may mean heftier fines if the commission were to push for a multi-year settlement, as it has done in the Apple case. While Google still controls about a third of the roughly $187bn (€177.6bn) worldwide digital advertising market, Facebook’s market share has risen rapidly in recent years, to 12%, according to global research firm e-Marketer. More than half of Google’s searches now come on mobile devices, and some analysts estimate more than half of its revenue comes from mobile. Advertisers’ spending on mobile search ads increased by over 50% in 2015, while overall search ad spending rose just 10%. Google also pays Apple to make Google the default search engine on iPhones, which gives it top billing on more than 1bn devices. The commission’s anti-trust probe clearly has this cosy arrangement in its sights. Google said it is now reaping the rewards from the shift to mobile because companies are increasingly willing to advertise on smartphones. That is in part because Google is adding new mobile ad formats and is better measuring the efficacy of such ads, including tracking users’ locations to see if they visit a physical store after seeing an ad for the store on their phones. However, the drive to improve the privacy rights of citizens is not welcome news to the many businesses that have come to rely on internet advertising to drive customers to buy their products. The internet has become an essential component of international business facilitating communication across the globe between advertisers, sellers, and customers. More specifically, websites have become customers’ first port of call for seeking information and eventually purchasing goods or services, whether online or offline. Consequently, businesses are increasing their presence on the internet and improving their advertising practices so that current and prospective customers receive ads with content that is relevant and meaningful to them. Separately, the commission’s statistics office Euro-stat release showed that most EU businesses have a website and one out of four used internet advertising in 2016. In Ireland and across the EU companies have been lobbying for continued ease of access and use of citizens data. As can be expected, companies who run their marketing campaigns on the internet use targeted advertisement methods that increase the likelihood of their promotional marketing messages reaching the right audience. They want to see continued and untethered use of internet advertising. Interestingly, the survey showed that internet advertising was not only used by companies that sell to consumers online. In fact, it is mostly used by companies selling offline. Businesses liked targeted internet advertising to use information from the content of the web pages viewed by internet users. Other than Airbnb, more than half of EU businesses providing accommodation services used internet ads. Contextual advertising was the most common form of internet advertising which was based on information about users’ past browsing activities recorded by cookies. The digital trace of users’ activities on the internet over time is an important source of information on interests, preferences, and shopping activities. Businesses use this information to determine whether an internet user belongs to a specific target audience, subsequently sending internet ads matching the user’s profile. Browsers providing geolocation services are pushing the envelope further, essentially attempting to locate users’ IP address, wifi, or network location. Internet users’ geographic location such as the country, region, city, and often zip code provide useful information for targeting suitable advertisements, for example about restaurants nearby. The use of geo-targeting advertising can be combined with using contextual advertising or behavioural targeting to further identify needs of a potential customer. Some three-quarters of EU businesses advertising on the internet used information from the content of internet surfers’ web pages or keywords from their queries to identify the audience accurately before sending relevant ads, according to the EU research. The Eurostat release also showed businesses in Ireland are top of the league in using (at two-thirds of all businesses) social media to reach customers. This is well above the EU average of 45%, and seems to indicate an early willingness to use social media to build their image and that of their products among the younger end of the consumer market. Ireland also features in the top echelon, with a third of companies using the internet for advertising of their products and services. Any attempts by the commission to rein in the expansion of US technology corporations is likely to further trouble the administration of president-elect Donald Trump. He had told executives from Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies that he was “here to help you folks do well”. Opening his first meeting with the technology industry at Trump Tower in New York last month, Mr Trump told the heads of companies including Apple, Google, and Amazon he stood ready to do “anything we can” to help them, despite potential divisions with Silicon Valley over issues including encryption, imports, and immigration. He went on to say: “We are going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.” There is no question that businesses in Europe and the US will agree with this sentiment. However, there is the question of the location where the super profits of the digital world should be declared. There is an urgent need to ensure that citizens’ privacy is protected in legislation. The digital field may be the first battleground for the trade wars Mr Trump had threatened during his election campaign.

This new device rivals the Echo, Dot, and Google Home when it comes to offering smart assistance at home. It looks more like an Amazon Echo and actually works like one because this speaks the language of Alexa. We know more similar gadgets will be announced this year but Lenovo gets ahead with this product. Using Alexa instead of making another software is a smart move because more people are now familiar with it. Lenovo has actually joined the bandwagon when it comes to personal assistant devices. Feel free to play a track, make a list, ask a question, and get updates on your events and calendar entries. The Lenovo Smart Assistant takes a cylindrical from. It looks like another smart speaker but more stylish than the Echo. It boasts of eight 360-degree microphones, noise suppression, acoustic echo cancellation, and Harman Kardon audio as another option. It can listen to you from a maximum of 16ft distance. Just ask Alexa and the Lenovo Smart Assistant will answer you. The Harman Edition will be more expensive at $179.99 but the standard version will only be $129.99.

A report by AndroidPolice now confirms that some subscribers of Google Drive are now getting billed on their Google Play account page. Essentially, Google wants to move all of its paid services under one roof, which is the Google Play Store. It actually makes sense as the process becomes more streamlined and information is easier to access. Apart from the billing migration, there will be no prominent changes to Google Drive. The new billing system will however let users use their Google Play credit to buy Google Drive storage. In case you haven’t been moved, you should wait as the changes are being made this month. To check your Google Drive subscription in Google Play Store, just open the options, hit Account and then enter the Subscriptions tab. A couple of days ago we heard Google expanding the carrier billing option to Airtel and Vodafone postpaid customers. While the addition of the new method was officially announced in October at the Google Playtime event in India, the rollout began over the past couple of weeks. Carrier billing payment allows a user to buy apps, music, books and movies from the Google Play Store while the cost is reflected in the user’s mobile postpaid bill. This feature has been available for Android users in a number of countries, however this feature was finally brought to India last year.

From a legal standpoint, the arguments that Google is making in its defense in an employee lawsuit are lame. Of course, it could be saving its real case for the court. Oddly, the summary below omits a key issue as to why Google’s surveillance and secrecy policies are problematic. From the underlying story at Information: The lawsuit alleges that Google warns employees to not put into writing concerns about potential illegal activity within Google, even to the company’s own attorneys, because the disclosures could fall into the hands of regulators and law enforcement. It also alleges that confidentiality provisions include a prohibition on employees writing “a novel about someone working at a tech company in Silicon Valley,” without Google signing off on the final draft. Among other things, this makes it impossible for Google to have any sort of internal whistleblower program, even when most are strictly cosmetic. Most corporate governance experts deem them to be necessary as a liability shield for management. Moreover, these agreements also violate the SEC’s whistleblower rules, which bar companies from hindering employees contacting agency officials regarding suspected abuses. Google’s top brass appear convinced that their internal code of omerta plus their connections means that they can dispense with that sort of thing. Google’s internal non-disclosure agreements apparently didn’t contain standard “outs,” the most important being that the signer can disclose information when compelled to by judicial decree, as long as they inform the company first and give them the opportunity to contest the order. I hope California readers will tell me about the reputation of the firm suing Google. The claim looks to be spare (a good sign) and well argued. Even though the usual rule of thumb with employee suits is that the big companies have a huge advantage by being able to hire better counsel, Google looks to have overreached to such a remarkable degree that the employee may well prevail. It would also help if outside parties take interest and provide amicus briefs on behalf of the plaintiff. By Michael Arria, an associate editor at AlterNet and AlterNet’s labor editor. Follow @MichaelArria on Twitter. Originally published at Alternet Tech news site the Information reports that a former Google employee is suing the company, claiming it maintained an internal spying program that encouraged workers to rat each other out. The lawsuit was filed by a former product manager who claims that the alleged program violates California labor law. The same person filed a National Labor Relations Board complaint against Google and its sister firm Nest this June. The NLRB complaint alleged that the employee was terminated after making a social media post that was critical of the company. The allegation also contends that the companies illegally monitored workers’ electronic devices to prevent them from airing criticisms of Google. The lawsuit points out that employees should be able to discuss workplace conditions without fearing retaliatory action. Google has called the lawsuit “baseless.” The Information piece quotes a statement from the company: We’re very committed to an open internal culture, which means we frequently share with employees details of product launches and confidential business information. Transparency is a huge part of our culture. Our employee confidentiality requirements are designed to protect proprietary business information, while not preventing employees from disclosing information about terms and conditions of employment, or workplace concerns. If the lawsuit ends up being successful, it could be extremely expensive for Google. The Information report breaks down the math: Google could be fined up to $100 for each of the 12 alleged violations in the suit, multiplied by 65,000 employees. If an allegedly unlawful policy lasted for more than one pay period, the fine doubles to $200 per pay period, per employee, for up to a year. If ‘Doe’ prevails on every allegation in the lawsuit, the maximum fine would be $3.8 billion, with about $14,600 going to each Google employee.

A judicial order would override any such non-disclosure agreement, right? Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorJanuary 3, 2017 at 7:28 pm Many people who were not legally sophisticated would not understand that. And Google could use the excuse that they’d violated an unenforceable non-disclosure agreement to fire them. Google is basically pressuring employees to defy courts and regulators.

Reply ↓ Scott January 3, 2017 at 2:09 pm I made a short movie about my interactions with Google, or attempted interaction anyway. It is somewhere amongst the 1300 shows on my youtube channel Transcendian. If you believe you have a business concept appropriate to pitch to Google, there is a Business Plan Process. The profoundly ridiculous Feature of that; That proves a insular hypocritical Google ideal, is that once you write it off to them, they take claim of it. Period. What good is that? Google as so many of the US founded corporations is one mythical foundational ideation, and then a degraded reality. It is a feature of the international corporate way where what is ours is ours, and then what is yours is ours. In closing I must say that Youtube is a Grand contribution to our mental landscape as it is as close to UNTV as we really have in light of the educational videos where people share how to do things for no reason but generosity of spirit. We are at our best when we seek to teach each other how to live in this physical life. We are at our worst when we steal from each other, for that is a feature of barbarism. Reply ↓ AmicusLong January 3, 2017 at 2:43 pm I believe the Google policy of taking claim to submitted ideas is fairly standard. Actually, my Dad told me this when I was about 10 years old (I’m over 50 now), and I will admit that I never verified this. Anyway, according to Pops back in the early 70s, it guards against the scenario where a company independently comes up with an idea that someone happens to submit. Reply ↓ der January 3, 2017 at 2:20 pm The Plaintiff “Doe” brings the lawsuit it seems mostly for being falsely indentified as a leaker to 65,000 Google employees when Google’s Director of Global Investigations, Intelligence & Protective Services, Brian Katz, knew Doe wasn’t the “guilty” party. Doe feels as a public scapegoat having his reputation damaged with other “Googlers”. https://www.scribd.com/document/334752552/Google-v-John-Doe Shades of Thomas Drake, Chelsey Manning, Bill Binney? Googles requirement to approve any book or article? Is this in response to Antonio Garcia Martinez’s “Chaos Monkeys”? I would be interested to hear what he thinks. Google, like the United States, is all powerful in many ways and has no worries about being taken over by 10 Isis muhjahideens or hackers but is described by Doe as like a paranoid totalitarian state actor. It’s a wonder either one, Free Market loving USA or Alphabet, wants a sharing economy with driverless Uber (carbombs) and AirBnB safe houses. Why did Katz have to be such an asshole? The case as filed is an interesting read and now Google can’t do a thing about because “it’s out there”. Damage, if there is any, is done whether Doe gets anywhere with this case. Reply ↓ JEHR January 3, 2017 at 2:59 pm It is too bad that monopolies like google are allowed to get so big that they fall in love with their own image. Reply ↓ mk January 3, 2017 at 7:28 pm Google could be fined up to $100 for each of the 12 alleged violations in the suit, multiplied by 65,000 employees.

Mobile by Scott Stein January 2, 2017 10:26 PM PST @jetscott Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Asus' next phone looks like it just got revealed.Photo by @evleaks Virtual reality? Augmented reality? Asus is working with Google to release a phone that does both, and it's being built with Qualcomm's chips. A leaked announcement via Qualcomm in advance of Asus' January 4 CES press conference revealed the Asus Zenfone AR, a phone that merges Google's Daydream View VR platform and its Tango depth-sensing cameras. A likely photo of the phone was posted by @evleaks (see above). Its camera array looks smaller than Lenovo's first Tango phone, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. The Zenfone AR also boasts a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor than the Phab 2 Pro, putting it more on par with Google's Pixel phones. Google's previous phones that work with its new Daydream VR platform include the Pixel, Pixel XL and the Motorola Z, while the only Tango-equipped phone was the Phab 2 Pro. Our experiences with it last year were promising, but very mixed. Zenfone AR, however, could bridge the gap between augmented and virtual reality, something Google's VP of VR, Clay Bavor, has aimed for since bringing Tango and Daydream under one umbrella last year. Combining VR and a movement-sensing, location-aware camera like Tango could lead to virtual reality apps and games tracking movement across a room, enabling VR experiences like those available on higher-end systems like the PC-based HTC Vive that otherwise require external boxes or sensors. Perhaps Zenfone AR will be a blueprint to exploring where Android's next-generation phones will go next. We'll have to wait to hear more at Asus' press conference on January 4.

The company says that its robotic lineup will be able to navigate complex environments and find out the most efficient route to complete the tasks allocated to them by making use of powerful analytical processing capabilities. Also unveiled ahead of CES were new UHD televisions with the company's Nano Cell LCD tech. The company's robot collection will be unveiled on Wednesday at CES and includes the Hub Robot, which will work both as a smart home gateway and a personal assistant for the users, the company said in its release. This sounds a lot like the Amazon Echo speaker powered by the Alexa voice-based virtual assistant, and Google Home speaker powered by the Google Assistant. Another robot from LG's lineup will demonstrate use in gardening while other models that will be on display have been designed for "commercial use in public spaces such as airports and hotels to help improve the traveller's experience," the company said in the release. Ahead of its CES 2017 event, the company has also announced its Super UHD lineup of LCD TVs featuring Nano Cell technology, which helps them produce more accurate colours than other television sets, as per company's claims. All three new models from the lineup, namely SJ9500, SJ8500, and SJ8000, feature Active HDR with Dolby Vision that allows support for multiple HDR formats. The new smart TV models from Super UHD lineup run on LG's webOS platform and come with a thin and "aesthetically pleasing" design, the company said in its release. The company says that the newly launched TV models have powerful audio capabilities. The use of Nano Cell technology is said to reduces the on-screen light glow to maintain picture quality even when these TVs are surrounded by intense ambient lighting. "Nano Cell LCD displays offer a technological advantage by employing uniformly-sized particles approximately one nanometre in diameter to create more subtle, accurate colours that can be viewed from wider angles than other TVs," LG said regarding the Nano Cell technology used in the TVs. LG says that the absorption of surplus light wavelengths allows Nano Cell tech to distinguish between colours with precision. The company further claims that the use of the Nano Cell LCD technology dramatically reduces instances of colour fading, image instability and other colour degradation issues. LG partnered with legendary motion picture technology firm - Technicolor - to work on the colour technologies used by the new TVs in order to try and accurately recreate the "artistic intent of content creators," the company said. "Our 2017 SUPER UHD TV lineup with LG's proprietary Nano Cell technology is a breakthrough in display technology that advances the LCD TV viewing experience to a level unlike any other," Brian Kwon, president of the LG Home Entertainment Company, was quoted as saying in the release. Apart from the new TV models, LG has also announced that it will be unveiling a new generation of its CordZero premium vacuum cleaners. In its press release, the company said that the use of its Aero Science vacuum technology and improved CordZero Handstick and CordZero Canister will help users experience a "new level of cleaning." The company claims that the use of Smart Inverter Motor, which at 115,000 RPM is said to spin 16 times faster than an aeroplane engine, provides the new CordZero Handstick with top class sunction power. In the weeks leading up to CES 2017, LG already unveiled several products that the company will be showcasing at the Las Vegas trade show. These products include company's ProBeam laser projector, LG K-Series smartphones, its PJ9 Levitating Bluetooth speaker, Tone Studio and Tone Free wireless audio products, and deep learning-based home appliances.

The survey showed that three-quarters of citizens believe that internet service providers such as Google and Facebook should not have the right to prevent access to their services if users refuse to store identifiers, such as cookies, on their equipment. There has been a wide practice of locating cookies which track computer users’ preferences and activities, without their consent or knowledge. Popular browsers like Netscape and Microsoft Internet Explorer placed them anonymously for years without alerting users. More recent practices, to put the onus on users to opt out, are equally invasive of privacy and data protection. However, three-quarters of industry, on the other hand, disagree. READ NEXT Dublin firm LogoGrab fights image fraud Online advertisers, in particular, say the proposals would upset the entire business model of the internet. The commission when it launched its Digital Single Market Strategy two years ago, which included the adoption of the general data protection regulation, was aware there was a danger the privacy of internet users could be abused. It led to an e-privacy directive review, which was aimed at reinforcing trust and security in digital services in the EU. The focus was on ensuring a high level of protection for citizens and a level playing field for all market players. Based on the consultation across EU states, the commission is now ready to issue a new legislative proposal on e-privacy. Without prejudice to the outcome of the evaluation, several policy issues have already emerged as key issues to be addressed in the review of the e-privacy directive. These include the need for new privacy rules on how internet platforms such as Google, Facebook and its WhatsApp subsidiary, and Microsoft and its Skype subsidiary track people online and then offer to target advertising to businesses. New rules are expected that will compel website and browser owners to gain the assent of users before bombarding them with advertising based on the profiles they have built up of these users. The commission is also probing the revenue that these internet platform owners derive from selling citizens’ profiles to companies who wish to sell goods and services, both online and in the high street. The commission is understood to be planning to introduce penalties for any breaches of the new e-privacy rules, including fines of 4% to 10% of the advertiser’s revenue. The move is considered by industry insiders as part of a wider attempt by Brussels to rein in big Silicon Valley corporations and their tax avoidance practices in Europe. It has already launched antitrust probes into Google and has, of course, ordered the Irish Government to collect €13bn in back taxes from Apple. In Google’s case, any fine could cost up to €6bn on current market sales and €2bn for Facebook. It may mean heftier fines if the commission were to push for a multi-year settlement, as it has done in the Apple case. While Google still controls about a third of the roughly $187bn (€177.6bn) worldwide digital advertising market, Facebook’s market share has risen rapidly in recent years, to 12%, according to global research firm e-Marketer. More than half of Google’s searches now come on mobile devices, and some analysts estimate more than half of its revenue comes from mobile. Advertisers’ spending on mobile search ads increased by over 50% in 2015, while overall search ad spending rose just 10%. Google also pays Apple to make Google the default search engine on iPhones, which gives it top billing on more than 1bn devices. The commission’s anti-trust probe clearly has this cosy arrangement in its sights. Google said it is now reaping the rewards from the shift to mobile because companies are increasingly willing to advertise on smartphones. That is in part because Google is adding new mobile ad formats and is better measuring the efficacy of such ads, including tracking users’ locations to see if they visit a physical store after seeing an ad for the store on their phones. However, the drive to improve the privacy rights of citizens is not welcome news to the many businesses that have come to rely on internet advertising to drive customers to buy their products. The internet has become an essential component of international business facilitating communication across the globe between advertisers, sellers, and customers. More specifically, websites have become customers’ first port of call for seeking information and eventually purchasing goods or services, whether online or offline. Consequently, businesses are increasing their presence on the internet and improving their advertising practices so that current and prospective customers receive ads with content that is relevant and meaningful to them. Separately, the commission’s statistics office Euro-stat release showed that most EU businesses have a website and one out of four used internet advertising in 2016. In Ireland and across the EU companies have been lobbying for continued ease of access and use of citizens data. As can be expected, companies who run their marketing campaigns on the internet use targeted advertisement methods that increase the likelihood of their promotional marketing messages reaching the right audience. They want to see continued and untethered use of internet advertising. Interestingly, the survey showed that internet advertising was not only used by companies that sell to consumers online. In fact, it is mostly used by companies selling offline. Businesses liked targeted internet advertising to use information from the content of the web pages viewed by internet users. Other than Airbnb, more than half of EU businesses providing accommodation services used internet ads. Contextual advertising was the most common form of internet advertising which was based on information about users’ past browsing activities recorded by cookies. The digital trace of users’ activities on the internet over time is an important source of information on interests, preferences, and shopping activities. Businesses use this information to determine whether an internet user belongs to a specific target audience, subsequently sending internet ads matching the user’s profile. Browsers providing geolocation services are pushing the envelope further, essentially attempting to locate users’ IP address, wifi, or network location. Internet users’ geographic location such as the country, region, city, and often zip code provide useful information for targeting suitable advertisements, for example about restaurants nearby. The use of geo-targeting advertising can be combined with using contextual advertising or behavioural targeting to further identify needs of a potential customer. Some three-quarters of EU businesses advertising on the internet used information from the content of internet surfers’ web pages or keywords from their queries to identify the audience accurately before sending relevant ads, according to the EU research. The Eurostat release also showed businesses in Ireland are top of the league in using (at two-thirds of all businesses) social media to reach customers. This is well above the EU average of 45%, and seems to indicate an early willingness to use social media to build their image and that of their products among the younger end of the consumer market. Ireland also features in the top echelon, with a third of companies using the internet for advertising of their products and services. Any attempts by the commission to rein in the expansion of US technology corporations is likely to further trouble the administration of president-elect Donald Trump. He had told executives from Silicon Valley’s most prominent companies that he was “here to help you folks do well”. Opening his first meeting with the technology industry at Trump Tower in New York last month, Mr Trump told the heads of companies including Apple, Google, and Amazon he stood ready to do “anything we can” to help them, despite potential divisions with Silicon Valley over issues including encryption, imports, and immigration. He went on to say: “We are going to make it a lot easier for you to trade across borders.” There is no question that businesses in Europe and the US will agree with this sentiment. However, there is the question of the location where the super profits of the digital world should be declared. There is an urgent need to ensure that citizens’ privacy is protected in legislation. The digital field may be the first battleground for the trade wars Mr Trump had threatened during his election campaign.

Savitribai K. Patil was born on January 3, 1831, in a rich and influential farming family and at the age of nine was married off to the 13-year old Jyotirao Phule. She was taught to read and write by her husband and when she turned 17, the couple founded India's first school for girls and women in Bhidewada, Pune. It started with just nine girls from different castes enrolled as students - but it became a historic step when female education was considered taboo in the orthodox Indian society prevalent then. The Phule couple - who had no children of their own - launched a crusade against social discrimination based on caste and gender, and sparked the flame for women's equal rights during the British ruled India. At a time when women had no say in anything, Savitribai's campaign covered child marriages, child widows, rape victims becoming pregnant, the practice of 'Sati', educating women and fighting for equal rights for all women. The colourful Doodle shows a simple Savitribai spreading her sari 'pallu' wide to encompass women from all sections of society for education and empowerment. The simple 'Goodle' (Google Doodle) shows a group of demure women assembled outside what could be a school for education in a skyblue starry background which also doubles as her blouse. Over the next few years, the Phules set up 18 more schools across the state of which Savitribai became the teacher, headmistress and principal. Nearly 18 decades later, the Maharashtra government renamed the Pune University as 'Savitribai Phule University' as a tribute to the Phule's sheer courage and pioneering efforts in the field of education, women empowerment, social reform and gender equality.

Basically the front-facing camera on the phone has a serial number that is different for every device, which might seem harmless but it could actually “facilitate tracking”. The good news is that it looks like Google has already fixed it via a patch. According to Google, “This commit restricts access to this system property to cameraserver and dumpstate and shell SELinux domains. Test: Camera works, serial number property still available via ADB, but not readable by apps.” In case you’re wondering what the big deal is, the serial number essentially identifies phones individually. It could be used to pinpoint your phone specifically and also track you, which is clearly not good for both security and privacy reasons. It seems that with this patch, it will restrict access to the serial number and prevents other apps from accessing it. It has been tested and it appears to work.

X How 2017 will pan out for the media in Ireland Budgets in newspapers, radio and TV are torn up as Facebook and Google strengthen Tue, Jan 3, 2017, 06:30 Laura Slattery Entertainment empires such as Sky and Time Warner jewel HBO, which makes Game of Thrones starring Kit Harington, do very well out of the so-called golden age of television.         Here is one, and only one, grand prediction for how 2017 will pan out for the media industry: It will be like 2016, only more so. That means it will be a little bit rocky, a little bit Brexity. Companies that don’t hail from California may find themselves the underdog in the battle for revenue with those that do. Issues of trust will affect every media company, including those, such as Facebook, that would prefer not to consider themselves media companies at all. The themes that have dominated the media landscape of late – convergence, consolidation, digital transition – will be back again for another sequel. Mobile will attract an even greater chunk of advertising cash. Companies from the once separate sectors of telecoms and content production will merge, or at least sit down and do business with one another. And Google and Facebook will consolidate their power, putting the squeeze on once-comfortable national media brands not blessed with anything like their scale. Double-digit declines In Ireland, the forecasts from various sources at the start of 2016 were for the print advertising market to be flat or down a fraction. Instead, it suffered double-digit declines. Radio revenues that were expected to increase 5 per cent, fell about 5 per cent, while the anticipated 7 per cent growth in television advertising turned out to be more like 3 per cent. That sound you hear is budget spreadsheets in the offices of newspaper, radio and television offices being torn up and hastily revised downwards. To some extent, the problem was Brexit-related. Caution crept in to the boardrooms of big household goods companies that decide their Irish marketing budgets out of London. ‘The Irish Times’ Christmas Business Quiz 2016: winners and answers Virgin Media leaves Horizon behind in television platform rebrand Sport dominates latest TV ratings If digital advertising was affected by these same woes, however, it did a pretty good job of hiding it. Digital ad revenues galloped ahead. Industry body IAB Ireland and PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated they had grown 33 per cent for the first half of 2016, with mobile revenues edging ahead of desktop for the first time. (Digital as a whole overtook television as the single biggest category of advertising in Ireland in 2015.) ADVERTISEMENT Every “legacy” media company has at least one foot in the digital camp, of course, and is looking at dipping the toes of their second foot in too. Shouldn’t they be profiting from this explosion in digital advertising revenues? In fact, the data suggested the key beneficiary was Facebook, while the paid search revenues that represent Google’s leading market share were no slouch either. Both companies tightened their grip on the global advertising market. In the third quarter, Google’s revenues rose 18 per cent, while Facebook reported a 56 per cent surge – thanks to mobile – and that wasn’t even its best quarter of the year. Their performance in the Irish market mirrors these global growth rates, industry figures suggest. Immense power Research firm eMarketer estimates that Facebook will have earned $26 billion (€24.8 billion) in advertising revenue in 2016, while Google is on track to capture about $53 billion. Little wonder then, with this immense power, both companies have come under greater pressure to acknowledge editorial responsibility for the content distributed by their algorithms. But the fake news scandal is just the bluntest manifestation of what can happen when Google and Facebook are gamed purely for ad dollars – the lowest forms of media clickbait are, of course, a cousin of fake news. Both have the same tactics wrapped into their business model. It is a truism of the internet age that money has been diverted away from content producers and into the pockets of the platforms and the distributors that make nothing. It certainly feels that way for news media, which is valiantly trying to recoup lost print circulation through online subscriptions. It’s the right way to go. The television business is more complex. Entertainment empires such as Sky and Time Warner jewel HBO do very well out of the so-called golden age of television, and it is no coincidence that both Sky and Time Warner are the subject of takeover bids as the year ends. As the bubble in sports rights nears bursting point, glossy premium dramas such as HBO’s Game of Thrones and its successors may become even more important subscriber bait. Every broadcaster’s bête noire is Netflix, a company with the polar opposite business model to Google and Facebook, and one that shows no sign of slowing down its hefty, striking investment in original content. In its bid to add subscribers to its advertising-free subscription service, Netflix spends $1 billion annually on marketing alone. Watching television The average time people spend watching “traditional” television every day has not fallen – not in Ireland –- and yet it would be foolish to assume that the array of on-demand options spearheaded by Netflix won’t have an impact on viewer habits. In 2016, there was evidence that Irish broadcasters were finding it harder to cut through to younger viewers – new shows on RTÉ 2 that would have been expected to garner 200,000 viewers if this were 2006, had to be satisfied with an audience closer to 100,000. Some of this new reality may be connected to demographic trends, but still, the fear must be there – as it is for music radio stations – that audience (dis)loyalty is approaching a tipping point. And, wait, what’s this? Facebook, which has about 1.2 billion active daily users, is reported to be “exploring” paying for its own original video content, commissioning it upfront from production companies, just like Netflix, just like Amazon Prime, and just like regular broadcasters. This one could really hurt.       Topics: Time Warner Amazon Facebook Google HBO Iab Netflix PwC Sky Read More INM takeover of Celtic Media Group to be examined Facebook to promote ‘healthy’ journalism in response to fake news Movie chain operator Cineworld’s group revenue up 8.3% Pearse Doherty questions Government will to curb vulture funds Trinity Mirror in talks to combine with Desmond’s UK papers TV3 promises ‘new world’ of TV – but what about the ‘old world’?

Photo: AP Michigan/San Francisco: Car electronics supplier Delphi Automotive Plc went coast-to-coast in 2015 in a self-driving Audi Q5 sport-utility vehicle to prove the autonomous automobile had arrived. Now, Delphi is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, the company will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. “The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, “Look what it can do,”’ said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of advanced engineering. “This year, the discussion is all about the path to production.” Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it’s in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens 5 January, the talk won’t be about proving technology— it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. “We’re close to bringing this to a lot of people,” John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. “We’re kind of at an inflection point.” At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21% more than last year. Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomy business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42 billion by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. “CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era,” said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield.” Prius problem One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. “Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer’s mind,” Wakefield said. “Then when you come out with one, it’s like, ‘Oh, you make one, too?”’ Google’s self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than 2 million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn’t yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Unlike traditional automakers, Alphabet’s businesses tend to focus on recurring revenue streams, such as search ads. Google’s project Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. “Google’s playbook here is well-tested,” said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer (CEO) of Zendrive, a transportation data startup, who formerly worked on Android. “They understand how to use the platform to create dominance.” Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the backseat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which said last week its test-fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. Acclimating consumers The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. “Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure,” Wakefield said. “As they gain confidence and think, ‘Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,’ GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise.” It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. “The high cost isn’t solved yet,” Wakefield said. “There’s not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two.” Safety improvements The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “It took air bags 15 years to get high penetration in cars,” Jonas said. Palo Alto, California-based Tesla—which doesn’t exhibit at shows such as CES—may be the biggest accelerant for autonomy. Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. CEO Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which puts pressure on other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. “Tesla is being a disrupter,” Wakefield said. “Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product.” Regulatory changes Autonomy also is getting a boost from U.S. regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. “Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule,” said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now “you’re going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers.” For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70 percent, De Vos said. “The economics are really compelling,” said De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi’s driverless car in Las Vegas. “After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers.” Bloomberg Keith NaughtonMark Bergen Topics: Self driving cars Delphi audi volvo automobile More From Livemint READ MORE Of founders and CEOs Reconsidering the 4% inflation target Kratikal Tech raises close to $500,000 in seed funding First Published: Tue, Jan 03 2017. 11 38 AM IST Editor's Picks Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

Sometime back we had reported that Asus is working on the next Google Tango-powered smartphone, but till now there weren't many details available about the upcoming device. Now with the latest revelations, it is confirmed that we are going to see the Asus Zenfone AR during CES 2017, all thanks to Qualcomm. The chip maker accidentally revealed that Asus will launch the second Google Tango-powered smartphone on January 4th. Qualcomm in a blog post which a publishing date of January 4, as spotted by GSM Arena, revealed that the device will be the first to support both Tango and Daydream technology. The company also said that the upcoming smartphone will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, the same chipset which powers Google Pixel and Asus Zenfone 3. "The ZenFone AR with Snapdragon 821 is built for VR with high-resolution display, ultra-smooth graphics and high-fidelity sensors for precise head tracking," Qualcomm's blog post reads. "Snapdragon 821 provides the cutting-edge visual, audio and interactive technologies required to deliver a truly immersive mobile VR experience for leading Android smartphones." The release does not provide any details about the specs and pricing of the device, but with a better processor built-in will presumably give a better experience as compared to the Phab 2 Pro. In order news, famous tipster Evan Blass, also known as @evleaks, has shared a press render of the Asus Zenfone AR, further giving a concrete evidence that the device will be officially announced on January 4th. The leaked images showcase the front and back of the device in full glory. The front showcases a home button at the base, while at the top there is speaker grille coupled with Asus logo sitting right beneath it. On the right, there are volume rocker and power on/off buttons. At the back, there are dual cameras with array of sensors which is ideal for a Google Tango-powered device. For those who are not aware, Tango (formerly named Project Tango in-testing) is a technology platform developed and authored by Google that uses computer vision to enable mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, to detect their position relative to the world around them without using GPS or other external signals. On the other hand, Daydream (http://www.themobileindian.com/news/20259_Google-Daydream-View-VR-Headset-to-be-available-from-November-10) is Google's take on the high quality mobile VR experience. Although it is only limited to Google Pixel and Pixel XL as of now, but other big brands like HTC, LG, Xiaomi and Huawei will also soon launch Daydream-compatible smartphones. With Daydream View, you can watch movies, TV shows, and even play VR games. It supports apps like YouTube, Street View, Play Movies and Google Photos and game like Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.

Mobile by Scott Stein 3 January 2017 6:26 am GMT @jetscott Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Asus' next phone looks like it just got revealed.Photo by @evleaks Virtual reality? Augmented reality? Asus is working with Google to release a phone that does both, and it's being built with Qualcomm's chips. A leaked announcement via Qualcomm in advance of Asus' January 4 CES press conference revealed the Asus Zenfone AR, a phone that merges Google's Daydream View VR platform and its Tango depth-sensing cameras. A likely photo of the phone was posted by @evleaks (see above). Its camera array looks smaller than Lenovo's first Tango phone, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. The Zenfone AR also boasts a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor than the Phab 2 Pro, putting it more on par with Google's Pixel phones. Google's previous phones that work with its new Daydream VR platform include the Pixel, Pixel XL and the Motorola Z, while the only Tango-equipped phone was the Phab 2 Pro. Our experiences with it last year were promising, but very mixed. Zenfone AR, however, could bridge the gap between augmented and virtual reality, something Google's VP of VR, Clay Bavor, has aimed for since bringing Tango and Daydream under one umbrella last year. Combining VR and a movement-sensing, location-aware camera like Tango could lead to virtual reality apps and games tracking movement across a room, enabling VR experiences like those available on higher-end systems like the PC-based HTC Vive that otherwise require external boxes or sensors. Perhaps Zenfone AR will be a blueprint to exploring where Android's next-generation phones will go next. We'll have to wait to hear more at Asus' press conference on January 4.

Home Industry Technology Fake BHIM apps on Google Play Store: What you need to do Fake BHIM apps on Google Play Store: What you need to do Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the launch of BHIM mobile app in order to enable citizens to make digital payments and transactions. While the app is at the top of Google charts with more than 3 million downloads, the same platform which is filled with numerous duplicate apps. By: FE Online | Updated: January 3, 2017 12:10 PM Some of the names with which the fake BHIM apps are listed on Google Play Store are: BHIM UPI Bank No internet, BHIM payment updater 2017, Modi Bhim, BHIM App-Radio Jay Bhim, Bhim Modi App, Bhim Modi, BHIM Payment-UPI Guide, BHIM Banking guide, BHIM banking, Modi ka Bhim. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced the launch of BHIM mobile app in order to enable citizens to make digital payments and transactions. While the app is at the top of Google charts with more than 3 million downloads, the same platform which is filled with numerous duplicate apps. Some of the names with which the fake apps are listed on Google Play Store are: BHIM UPI Bank No internet, BHIM payment updater 2017, Modi Bhim, BHIM App-Radio Jay Bhim, Bhim Modi App, Bhim Modi, BHIM Payment-UPI Guide, BHIM Banking guide, BHIM banking, Modi ka Bhim and many more. Some of these apps also act as a guide to using the original BHIM app but all they do is redirect it to the actual app. There is one app which claims to even verify your new Rs 2,000 currency note. You need not worry but just keep a few things in mind before downloading and using the app. The payments app based on Aadhaar has been developed by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). Even their Twitter handle warns users from downloading duplicate apps. You should not go to a third party play store, but only on Google’s own Play Store when downloading the app. The app should have NPCL’s name in the developer’s category. Stay away from apps which have website domains in the title. You can download the app from this link: http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.org.npci.upiapp Some of the fake apps have crossed hundreds of thousands of downloads from the Play Store, which means a lot of people are getting duped and they are not able to reap the benefits of the original app. One of the apps called 99# BHIM UPI Bank No internet has able to manage 1 lakh downloads and claims to offer USSD and UPI payments services, but it only has a list of banks which offer that. There is, however, a disclaimer in the description, but it can easily be missed by someone downloading it. Also read | BHIM app reaches top of Google charts; Nandan Nilekani says ‘dream debut’ Most of the apps only consist of lists, but there are some of them which ask you for access to your pictures and data, which can be dangerous. The funny thing is that all the fake apps have decent ratings on the Play Store, and we fail to see why. BHIM app is the Indian government’s latest app to push India towards a cashless or ‘less-cash’ society. After downloading the BHIM app from the Play store, the user has to register his/her bank account and set up a UPI Pin for it. So, beware before downloading fake apps, and in case you want a guide to using the app, we have a link here. Please Wait while comments are loading...

We explain why Australians have the national holiday on January 26 Rozina Sabur Claire Lomas Eleanor Muffitt 3 January 2017 • 6:00am Australia Day is a national holiday in the country, marking the arrival of the British settlers in 1788. January 26 saw the arrival of the First Fleet of 11 convict ships from Britain and the holiday commemorates commander Captain Arthur Phillip's raising of the Union Jack at Sydney cove. But Australia Day has become an opportunity for a general celebration of what's great about Australia and being Australian. Watch | Australia Day 2016 celebrations 00:56 More than half of the country’s 21 million inhabitants celebrate either by going to an organised event in their community or by meeting up with family and friends on the holiday. It is also a chance for new citizens to celebrate their Australian citizenship. Last year Google honoured the day with a Google Doodle on the search engine's Australian site, which pictured a weeping mother sitting in an ochre desert, dreaming of her children. The doodle was drawn by Ineka Voigt from Canberra High School, who entered it into a competition run by Google Australia to have her drawing placed on the Google Australia homepage. Google's Australia Day doodle The national day was also mired in debate, with seven out of eight Australian state and territory leaders signing a declaration that "Australia should have an Australian head of state". This increased the demand among some republicans that the monarchy should be abandoned before the Queen's reign ends. The debate over the monarchy was reignited in September 2015 after Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull gained power. Australia held a referendum on becoming a republic in 1999, with the people voting 'no' by 54 per cent. Queen Elizabeth receives flowers from schoolchildren in Sydney in 2006 Credit: Reuters Australian of the Year Although the winner of the 2017 Australian of the Year Awards won't be announced until 25 January, among the finalists are Deng Adut, child soldier turned successful lawyer, Andrea Mason, 2016's indigenous leader and business woman of the year, and Andrew Forrest, an anti-slavery advocate. Last year former Lieutenant-General David Morrison was named as Australian of the Year, who is widely known for ordering army troops to accept women as equals in a viral video. He caused controversy in his acceptance speech by wading into the debate on the monarchy, saying "I will lend my voice to the republican movement in this country. It is time, I think, to at least revisit the question so we can stand both free and fully independent amongst the community of nations." London celebrations Home to tens of thousands of Australians, London's bars will be hosting a range of events in honour of the day, from bar crawls to movie marathons. Craft beer fans can head over to the Australia Day Craft Beer Festival in Hackney, with live music, DJ sets and the inevitable barbie. For wine connoisseurs, Wine Australia will be holding a tasting of over 1000 wines. South Londoners can head to the Clapham Grand for 'Aussie-inspired' facny dress, barbecues and beer. Fitzrovia's Dickie Fitz is treating guests to a four-course meal of modern Australasian fare, including kangaroo tartare, barbecued prawns and Australian kingfish with bush lime - as well as wine pairings and talks by the region's experts. Not much has been announced so far for 2017, but to get an idea of what to expect, here's what London had to offer Aussies in 2016. Belushi's bars in London Bridge and Shepherds Bush had Bundy Rum, Triple J's hottest 100 countdown and Australian sport on big screens. Claiming to be the top bar for London-based Aussies, Belushi’s also put on events at their Berlin, Barcelona, Amsterdam and Paris bars. For a bar crawl, drinkers headed to Shoreditch's Translate Bar where the Bogan Bar Crawl will began. The Grand Union in Brixton had barbie-themed festivities, sizzling sausages and "Australian inspired antics". Fitzrovia's Jetlag Sportsbar hosted an early morning showing of the cricket, followed by a movie marathon. In the West End, there was a beach party-themed night and comedy show at Bar Rumba and yes, another bar crawl, starting in Zoo Bar.

The collaboration focuses on the next generation of connected car systems, using the Android open-source platform. Android offers automakers user interface customisation, a full-featured automotive infotainment stack and ability to integrate Android apps into the vehicle's infotainment system. A hands-on concept demonstration of the power of combining Uconnect with Android is on display at the global consumer electronics and consumer technology tradeshow CES, 5-8 January in Las Vegas, inside a Chrysler 300 sedan. FCA is in collaboration with Google regarding the next-generation connected car systems enabled by the power of an open platform and ecosystem of Android. "This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers' increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction," says FCA head of electrical engineering Chris Barman. "With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android's features and ecosystem of applications." CES attendees can get one-on-one demonstrations of the Uconnect system powered by the latest version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, which includes core infotainment features such as radio and comfort controls. The Uconnect and Android integration also enable a system that is built for connectivity and compatibility with the universe of popular Android applications. The demonstration will show a seamless integration with Google Assistant, Google Maps and popular Android apps like Pandora, Spotify, NPR One and Pocket Casts. "Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way," said Google director of android engineering Patrick Brady. "This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age." tags GoogleFiatAndroidInfotainmentUconnectCEScarsystem Trending Tele-connectivity: Nepal's dependence on India to end in Feb Indian digital industry to be worth Rs 20k cr by '20: EY report Dec '16: Private TV channels now number 899 Wow, exclaim kids at Hershey's product It's all FMCG brands among top 10 TV advertisers in week one of 2017   Latest Reads Dec '16: Private TV channels now number 899 NEW DELHI: The total number of private television channels has risen to 899, with nine new television channels cleared in December 2016.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News Google Drive subscription billing starts migrating to Play Store Google Drive subscription billing starts migrating to Play Store Google Drive subscriptions are moving to the Play Store in an attempt to streamline Google's paid services under one place. By: Tech Desk | Updated: January 3, 2017 10:09 am This change will have no affect in Google Drive ‘Terms of Service’ or the subscription rates.  A few weeks ago Google announced that billing for Google Drive storage subscription will move on to the Play Store in January, and it appears this is already live for some people. According to an AndroidPolice report, users who are already subscribed to Google Drive can check to see if the billing has moved on to their Google Play account page. For those who can’t find it, they will be getting the new billing system later this month. The change in the billing system will have no other effect on the Google Drive subscriptions, except it brings payments  to a different place. This will help Google streamline its subscription-based services under one billing system, Google Play Store. There will be no change in the ‘Google Drive Terms of Service’. In a press note last month, Google had said the Google Play account page will be the new place where users go to manage their Google Drive subscriptions. However, users will continue to access support for the service through the help center. The pricing of storage on the Drive also remains unchanged, and the shift in billing will not be affecting users who try to access their online files. The one upside to the new billing system is the fact that you can now use your Google Play credit to buy Google Drive storage. Read: WhatsApp stops working in older iPhones, Android handsets Google last month added a new backup feature to Google Drive app on iOS, which makes it easier for users to shift from iOS to Android with ease. Contacts are automatically backed up to the drive, events will be added to Google Calendar, while photos and videos will be backed on to Google Photos under this feature. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags: Google Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house owned by Home Minister’s family under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentSalman Khan shares nostalgic picture from sets of Karan Arjun, wishes SRK-Hrithik for Raees-Kaabil EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party Must Read SportsKohli, Kedar hit magical tons to script sensational win SportsThis win is going to take a while to sink in, says Kohli SportsVirat Kohli leaves Twitterati awe-struck after century TechnologyNokia could be developing a foldable smartphone, hints patent TechnologyLenovo sends out press invite for MWC 2017, may debut Moto G5 Plus TechnologyFormer Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end, AI-focused smartphone  Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto, Pooja Hegde: Best and worst dressed Bollywood divas at Filmfare Awards 2017 Jan 16: Latest News Centre issues draft requirements under digital village initiative Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% China finally agrees to import buffalo meat from India Kathputli Colony: Life at the transit camp C N Rao at Jamia Hamdard Convocation: ‘To excel in science, we need hard work, funds for varsities’                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

For more information on Server Virtualization Navigating Your IT Career Exploring the Private Cloud for Your Organization IT Manager's Guide to Social Networking Partner Offers Microsoft had already supported Kubernetes on Azure for at least two years, but now things are getting more serious. "Today, we are taking this support even further and announcing the preview release of Kubernetes on Azure Container Service," Corey Sanders, Azure's director of compute, said in an announcement on the Microsoft Azure site. "This deeper and native support of Kubernetes will provide you another fully open-source choice for your container orchestration engine on Azure," Sanders continued. Microsoft also supports Docker Swarm and Mesosphere's DC/OS, but it seems it's Kubernetes that is taking over the world. At the rate things are going, Kubernetes may not be the only horse in the container management system race, but it will be the punter's choice and the bookies' odds-on favorite. So it's worth pondering why this might be. One person who has looked into container management systems in great depth is Joe Fernandes. He's a senior product manager at the open-source software company Red Hat, and he was part of the team that decided Red Hat should standardize on Kubernetes for Red Hat's open-source OpenShift PaaS offering. Back in 2013 the company considered building a home-grown container management system, and at the same time it looked at Mesos and talked to Google about its plans for Kubernetes. "What we saw in terms of functionality (with Kubernetes) was far ahead of Mesos and Marathon," he says. Kubernetes Standing Out in the Crowded Container Orchestration Field But equally important to Fernandes was Google's heritage in containers, he adds. "They have been on record as saying that everything they run is containerized. Kubernetes is not Borg (Google's resource orchestration software), but it was written from scratch using the experience gained over the space of a decade. Another important point in its favor (perhaps not surprisingly for an open-source company like Red Hat) was the fact that Google is a committed open-source sponsor. (In fact, the Kubernetes project is now hosted by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, which Fernandes believes is an added bonus.) "We talked to Google before Kubernetes became an open source project, but now it is faster growing, it is backed by a large number of vendors, and it is rapidly getting new capabilities and running different styles of workloads," says Fernandes. By contrast, he points out that although Mesos has the backing of Apache, it doesn't have the backing of a large number of vendors. "Only Mesosphere — although a couple of others do offer it as an option in the cloud (like Microsoft)," he says. The reason behind this, Fernandes believes, is that the codebase of Mesos is not easy to extend or build on. "I don't think they did as good a job of building the open-source community," Fernandes says. He also believes the biggest competitor to Kubernetes (and one that Red Hat considered, you'll recall) is the do-it-yourself approach. But the reality is that the container world is evolving very rapidly indeed, which makes that approach largely impractical, according to Fernandes. "Kubernetes is updated four times per year," says Fernandes. "Docker three or four times. Building these solutions yourself is incredibly time consuming, so most enterprises would be better spending their time building apps and getting someone else to build the orchestration platform," he says. So there you have it. There's no reason to think Mesos or Docker Swarm will be disappearing from the orchestration scene any time soon. But there are good reasons why Kubernetes seems to be proliferating. There are open core products built on it (like Tectonic) and fully open-source solutions that use it (like OpenShift), and in the future we are likely to see more of both of these types of offerings — all based on Kubernetes.

Eyal Toueg Automakers have seen the future — and it’s in Israel After BMW, Israel's Mobileye poised to seal second self-driving car deal Business feature Israeli VC remains bullish, foreseeing $10b companies Nearly every Israeli is familiar with the Waze application, which has changed the way we all drive. But the Waze brand only really has a presence in Israel; elsewhere in the world, it has been swallowed up in the company that bought it for $1.1 billion in 2013: Google. Some 70% of all traffic information on the Google Maps app – the largest of its kind globally, of course – is based on Waze technology. So the Waze revolution is changing traffic throughout the world, though mostly under a different name. The success of the Israeli startup is something others are seeking to emulate. And Waze isn’t the only local success story when it comes to transportation. Mobileye, which manufactures safety systems that identify when a vehicle veers from its lane or is getting too close to vehicles or pedestrians, is valued at more than $7.5 billion – despite a rift that has developed between the company and U.S. automaker Tesla, the world’s most prominent developer of driverless cars. Public transportation app Moovit has amassed 50 million users in 1,200 cities worldwide; these numbers attracted the attention of some of the world’s biggest automakers, and BMW is now an investor in the Nes Tziona-based company. Then there’s the taxi-ordering app Gett (previously known as GetTaxi), which nabbed a $300-million investment from Volkswagen last May. One of the lesser-known Israeli startups in the field is Hod Hasharon-based Valens, which developed a chip for transferring and processing large quantities of data at high speed in the smart car, and is collaborating with German automaker Daimler. In addition, General Motors has operated an R&D plant in Israel since 2008, and now employs 250 researchers. Daimler is currently opening its own research center here, while Renault is mulling a similar move. All of these examples, and more, are cited in a comprehensive report prepared by German strategic consulting firm Roland Berger, which was just submitted to the Alternative Fuels Administration in the Prime Minister’s Office. The report’s title, “Israel’s Automotive & Smart Mobility Industry,” belies the ambition behind it: In the coming weeks, the government will be presented with a National Plan for the Development of Smart Transportation, which in the first stage will include the formation of a team headed by PMO Director General Eli Groner and Transportation and Road Safety Ministry Director General Keren Turner and tasked with formulating policy that will turn Israel into a smart transportation superpower. Fashionably late The team will try to determine the application mechanisms needed to advance the smart transportation plan, whose guidelines have been set down by the Alternative Fuels Administration. The plan has six key points: allocating physical territory for transportation experimentation; making all government transportation databases accessible to those who wish to develop technological solutions; promoting cooperation between the industry and academia – essentially, creating an Israeli MIT that will bring together departments like geography, engineering, architecture, urban planning with the Office of the Chief Scientist to advance technological ideas in the field of transportation; changing the regulation to make it possible to conduct experiments and development in Israel i.e., for driving without two hands on the wheel; support for new developments and pilot programs; and comprehensive mapping of every road, parking lot, intersection and set of traffic lights in Israel. The plan will evidently call for the abovementioned 250-million-shekel investment initially. To a large degree, the government was forced to come out with its smart transportation plan after the local high-tech industry made such a splash in the field. But the government’s fashionably late entrance into the game is not a cause for concern. According to the data from Roland Berger, smart transportation is a “disruptive technology” – an industry that creates new markets with its innovative technologies. There is no question that smart transportation technology is going to fundamentally change the business model of every automaker, every public transportation operator and every transportation ministry worldwide. Wanted: Unconventional thinking By 2030, income in the field is forecasted to reach between $7.8 trillion to $9.4 trillion, with profits totaling $57.5 billion. This is a huge opportunity because of the tremendous magnitude involved, and because this is disruptive technology. The startup nation on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean has a clear relative advantage when it comes to disruptive technologies that require thinking outside the box. This sort of thought process covers ideas like traffic lights that change depending on the state of the traffic; buses that skip stops based on the number of people waiting at each one; buses that pick up people from their homes on order; cars that communicate with each other for safety or traffic management purposes; parking garages where the car parks itself; cars that brake independently in order to avoid an accident; and even – though not before 2030, it would seem – a transition to driverless cars. The world of autonomous vehicles will also be a world of only electric cars, with batteries that charge in mere seconds, and advance payment and ordering systems that will let people order a ride or share a trip for maximum convenience. Forecasting of traffic pressures and passenger loads will be a key part of these advanced transportation systems, as will the development of alternative energy sources. Traditional automakers are going to be hit by this technological shift. They will see the concept of the car losing its prestige and their brand losing its importance. In the age of the driverless vehicle, many fewer cars will be produced since they will have a much longer lifespan; and fierce price competition can be expected among manufacturers. Ridesharing, currently perceived as a forward-looking industry, could also take a hit in the absence of private cars in which to share rides. The Waze application. Household name in Israel, but its technology is used elsewhere within Google Maps.Bloomberg Meanwhile, countries at the forefront of this technological development and who adapt their transportation systems to the required technologies could reap vast benefits. The Roland Berger report says Israel is at an optimal starting point to profit from the change. It has no automakers that stand to be hurt. At the same time, it is a technology leader in electro-optics, big data and forecasting, and also a leader in the transition to electric vehicles. Israel already has more than 500 startups working in the field. In all, there are about 2,000 entrepreneurs and some 200 research studies focused on areas connected with smart transportation. Startups need the government The early success of companies like Waze, Mobileye, GetTaxi and Moovit has stoked excitement and whet the appetite for more of the same. But unlike other fields of technology, in the smart transportation field startups need government assistance – or mainly an assurance that the government won’t get in their way. Regulation is needed to enable experiments in various types of transportation, to allocate areas for experimentation and make government data on transportation accessible. Such access would include, for example, making the database of Rav-Kav card users available for public use, including information about where each rider gets on and off a bus, to enable the construction of forecasting models for passenger traffic. It would also include online mapping of all the roads in Israel – down to the level of cracks in the road, which the self-driving car needs to know about in real time. All of this is necessary for the smart transportation revolution to really take off, as is funding from the Israel Innovation Authority to encourage the development of relevant technologies. To ensure that Israel doesn’t miss out on this massive opportunity, the special team was established to consider how best to implement the smart transportation plan. The fact that the team is situated in the Prime Minister’s Office, under the director of the PMO and with the support of the National Economic Council, shows how much importance the matter has been given. One can only hope that all the good intentions won’t be squandered by the questionable ability of the government to implement them.

By Therese Poletti Published: Jan 3, 2017 8:46 a.m. ET Share Opinion: Ridiculous expectations for highly valued ‘unicorns’ like Uber and Airbnb may hurt chances for an IPO revival MarketWatch illustration/Shutterstock Snapchat parent company Snap is expected to go public in 2017, but can excitement for the offering translate to other tech IPOs? By TheresePoletti Columnist Snap Inc. is expected to be 2017’s savior from a depressing market for initial public offerings, but the ridiculously high valuations of other so-called unicorns, as well as a market still seen as unsteady, could make the chances for a revival disappear as fast as a Snapchat message. 2016 is expected to go down as the worst year for IPO returns since 2003, according to global IPO investment adviser Renaissance Capital, and the technology startups that have garnered so much ink in the past few years were a major reason. There were only 21 U.S. tech IPOs in 2016, according to Renaissance, which also manages IPO-focused exchange-traded funds. Tech deals did make a comeback in the fourth quarter amid pent-up demand, though, leading to predictions of a surge of tech deals next year. Strong performances by recent tech IPOs like Twilio Inc. TWLO, +0.29%  and Nutanix Inc. NTNX, +0.96%  are helping to boost the confidence levels of investors and pundits. Read also: Trivago brings depressing year for IPOs to a close “We are incredibly busy right now talking to companies about their potential listings for next year, much busier than last year for sure,” said Jeff Thomas, vice president and head of Western Region listings at Nasdaq. “Now that we have the election behind us, things are more certain.” “We believe that tech IPO activity will pick up significantly in 2017 and 2018, breaking the long IPO Recession of 2015-16,” Renaissance Capital said in a report last week. The most optimism stems from Snap, the developer of the Snapchat mobile app, which has reportedly confidentially filed paperwork to go public and raise as much as $4 billion, in a deal that will value the company at around $20 billion to $25 billion. “Once Snap goes public, it will be a bellwether,” PrivCo analyst Evan Danckwerth said. But can Snap unlock the doors to Wall Street for other highly valued startups? Duncan Davidson, a general partner at Bullpen Capital in Menlo Park, has huge expectations for Snap as a potential to be a major player in tech. But he also anticipates Snap’s IPO to be more like Google’s much lower-key Dutch auction IPO, in that it will not have a big impact on the market. “There is an IPO that comes along like twice a decade…[from] the platform companies that drive everything in the future,” Davidson said in an interview. “I don’t think there is any doubt that Snap is one of these type of companies, like Google and Facebook. But this IPO is not going to open the floodgates, this is like Google in 2004.” See also: Investors hope Snapchat IPO will unlock IPO market for tech unicorns Many of the “unicorn” companies — startups with valuations of $1 billion or more on paper — have raised so much money from venture capitalists, mutual funds, sovereign-wealth funds and individuals that there is growing pressure on these startups to return some capital to early investors. But those same investments may have put price tags on the companies that public investors are unwilling to pay. “[Investors] want an exit, but recognize that some of last year’s valuations may now look rather lofty,” said Lise Buyer, partner and founder of Class V Group, an IPO advisory firm. “It’s not unreasonable to reason that they presume it is better to get out at the beginning of the unicorn herd than toward the end.” In a report last month, PrivCo Media LLC, which tracks private companies, identified 130 candidates with the highest potential to go public in 2017. PrivCo said that 69 out of the 130 candidates they identified as IPO possibilities are unicorns that raised a cumulative $78 billion in funding, at an average funding round of $88 million, and generated $69.2 billion in revenue for 2015. Its report includes a list of 10 notable IPO candidates: Snap, ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc., cloud-storage provider Dropbox Inc., home-rental service Airbnb Inc., music-streaming service Spotify Ltd., Chinese drone maker DJI Ltd., youth-focused digital media company Vice Media LLC, online student loan refinancing company Social Finance Inc., Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi Inc., and co-working-space provider WeWork LLC. This group included some of the world’s loftiest private valuations, such as Uber, which has raised a total of $13 billion since it was founded in 2009 and now has an approximate $68 billion valuation, and Xiaomi, which is valued at about $45 billion. Among some of the big questions IPO investors wonder is whether Uber and Airbnb, two of the highest-valued U.S. companies, will take the plunge, especially after Uber’s latest financial disclosures to a chosen group of investors reportedly showed it is on track to hit losses of about $3 billion this year. Those losses could mean that Uber will try to get in better shape financially before it goes to the public markets. Alternatively, Uber may need more funding and its current investor base is likely tapped out, as its last fundraising in June of $3.5 billion came from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign-wealth fund. Read also: Uber is hiding everything it can The investors who seemingly poured cash in piles onto these companies are going to want some returns, and next year may see their day of reckoning. Many companies, though, are likely going to have a hard time achieving their lofty valuations in the public market and could end up like Square Inc. SQ, +0.07% with an IPO that comes out below its private valuation. “Expectations are going to be incredibly high,” PrivCo analyst Kashif Sheikh said. “The growth required to meet those numbers is insane. I don’t think anyone in history is going to have as much pressure as these guys.” One of those companies with immediate pressure to go public is Spotify, which did a convertible offering to raise more money last year with terms that will push it toward an IPO within a year, or it will pay more in interest until it goes public. Still, Renaissance noted in its report that Snap and Spotify alone “stand to raise more capital than all VC-backed tech IPOs in the last two years combined.” CBInsights, which does research on venture funding and private companies, came out with its own list near the end of 2016, with a total of 369 venture capital and private equity-backed technology companies in its 2017 Tech IPO Pipeline. It includes a Top 5 list most likely to go public this year, based on its company-rating algorithm: Qualtrics, an online survey company; Blue Apron, a meal-kit service that has reportedly delayed its IPO plans; Okta, corporate identity software for employee device management; Zuora, automated cloud-based billing and operations software; and Pluralsight, subscription-based software developer training. The first three were valued at over $1 billion at the time of their last fundraising, while Zuora and Pluralsight were valued at just under $1 billion. See also: Racism is built into sharing economy, and startups can do little about it “I think we are going to see companies across all sectors,” said Jackie Kelley, Americas IPO leader at EY (the former Ernst & Young), at an event on the outlook for tech IPOs sponsored by Quartz earlier this month, adding that “some of those unicorns we have been waiting for” will be among the deals. Kelley declined to comment specifically on which companies, but based her comments on information coming directly from companies that EY is advising on going public. Underpinning all the chatter about the potential for big deals next year is trepidation about rising interest rates, fears that the U.S. economy is due for a recession and unknowns about what a Donald Trump presidency will mean for Silicon Valley, even after his after olive-branch attempt with tech leaders. “Certainly there are reasons to believe it could be a strong year for IPOs, but there is enormous uncertainty from a macroeconomic perspective with the change in the administration,” said Buyer of Class V. “Uncertainty is not a friend of the IPO market and could have an impact that overwhelms the fundamental readiness of potential IPO candidates.” Read also: Why election-related IPO delays are not always a good excuse A rising interest-rate environment and questions about whether the U.S. is due for a recession and other warning signs of a weakening economy could help end the current market rally or at least start more volatility. Big swings in the market or higher numbers on the volatility index known as the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -2.69% could quickly kill any IPO-ready environment. “It’s really dangerous, this [Dow nearing] 20,000, if you are at a record high and fundamentals don’t add up,” Sheikh said. “People are taking advantage of the interest-rate environment [in real estate] and bankers are thinking the same thing: ‘We better do this now and there is a chance that this party won’t last.’” Sheikh predicts a flurry of companies filing to go public in the first quarter, but those companies could decide to hold off depending on Snap’s performance and market conditions. ”We have seen plenty of canceled IPOs in the past,” he noted. News of recent cancellations like Blue Apron’s and SoFi’s IPOs, combined with the possibility of a market peak and all the other conditions and “you’ve got a recipe for an even worse IPO environment than last year,” he added. Snapchat Prepares for $25 Billion IPO(1:34) Snap Inc., the parent of Snapchat, is working on an IPO that could value the virtual-messaging company at $25 billion or more. Photo: Snap While there may be pent-up demand from investors who like to buy into IPOs, that demand may also be tempered by the fact that some larger investors, including some mutual funds, have already invested in some unicorn companies while they are still private. Some of those investors marked down the estimated value of their investments earlier this year and then raised the value of its holdings in some of the same companies just a few months later. Another investor contingency is employees, some of whom have been able to get liquidity through selling some of their shares through secondary markets, such as the Nasdaq Private Market, another factor that has allowed companies to stay private longer. And some companies may just defer as long as they can, if they cannot go public at their current private valuation or if they are not ready to face public scrutiny. Many factors are going to come to play with each individual company as they look to take the plunge or not. And for those that do, investors should also look for any signs that the company’s biggest growth spurt has already occurred, another risk when companies stay private too long. “Just because something was valued highly in the private market does not mean that the valuation will carry through,” Buyer said. “There are some companies that should go public. But for a bunch of companies that are going to be forced to go, it won’t be the best time for them,” PrivCo’s Danckwerth said. “A lot of them are going to be undone by this market.” Also read: The IPO market is in the dumps, and all the tax cuts in the world won’t help More from MarketWatch The Ex-British Spy Behind Trump Dossier: What We Know Trump Press Conference: Five Announcements Obama on Transferring Power Peacefully to Donald Trump Related Topics Science and Technology U.S. Stocks Markets Startups Quote References TWLO +0.08 +0.29% NTNX +0.29 +0.96% SQ +0.01 +0.07% VIX -0.31 -2.69% Most Popular Why Goldman sees only 90 good days for U.S. stocks in 2017 More Democratic lawmakers plan on boycotting Trump’s inauguration Stocks may need a flawless earnings season to keep Trump rally going CIA chief John Brennan has a stern warning for Donald Trump Tour the house Obama will live in after he moves out of the White House Data Provided By Today's Interest Rates Mortgage Equity Savings Auto Credit Cards 30 yr fixed Jumbo 4.41% 30 yr fixed 4.03% 15 yr fixed 3.18% 10 yr fixed 3.08% 30 yr fixed refi 4.07% 15 yr fixed refi 3.19% 5/1 ARM 3.29% 5/1 ARM refi 3.5% National averages from Bankrate.com $30K HELOC 4.57% $50K HELOC 4.64% $75K HELOC 4.64% $100K HELOC 4.34% $30K Home Equity Loan 4.54% $50K Home Equity Loan 4.17% $75K Home Equity Loan 4.17% $100K Home Equity Loan 4.08% National averages from Bankrate.com 5 yr CD 1.2% 2 yr CD 0.75% 1 yr CD 0.59% MMA $10K+ 0.23% MMA $50K+ 0.36% MMA Savings 0.31% MMA Savings Jumbo 0.35% National averages from Bankrate.com 60 Mo Used Car 3.1% 48 Mo Used Car 3.09% 36 Mo Used Car 3.23% 72 Mo New Car 3.44% 60 Mo New Car 3.15% 48 Mo New Car 3.06% 60 Mo Auto Refi 2.91% 36 Mo Auto Refi 2.61% National averages from Bankrate.com Avg.

The technology, which is now ready for its CES 2017 debut, is based on Android Nougat.  ( Uconnect ) Advertisement It seems that Fiat Chrysler Automobiles liked what Google has done to its hybrid Pacifica minivan so much that it announced a new collaboration with the tech company, and this time, it involves the development of its Uconnect infotainment system based on Android Nougat. Android Auto Plus UConnect A working prototype will be showcased at CES 2017, and it will be outfitted in the dashboard of a Chrysler 300 sedan. Consumers can expect a modified Android build, tailored according to the current Uconnect system. This seems to be different than Android Auto as FCA states it is tweaking Android Nougat itself to integrate core Google services into Uconnect. "With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android's features and ecosystem of applications," Chris Barman, head of electrical engineering at FCA, explained in an official release. Barman also noted that the collaboration would mean FCA and its cars will be contributing to the development of in-vehicle technology, particularly with respect to gauging and satisfying consumer requirements and desires in their infotainment systems. Google In-Vehicle Technology Ambition If one does think about it, the Google-FCA partnership seems inevitable. It is helpful to remember that Google has already released the latest update to Android Auto, which made it available to the entire Android-wielding public. What is particularly important is how devices running the app can immediately provide the full Android Auto experience once plugged in to vehicles. This capability could actually diminish the roles of proprietary infotainment systems such as the FCA's existing Uconnect technology because Android Auto hosts key applications that many consumers want such as Google Maps, Spotify, and Google Assistant, among others. Modified Android In the case of Chrysler, Android will be embedded into the dashboard. FCA, however, has carefully highlighted that it will be heavily tweaked to achieve what it calls as unique and intuitive Uconnect interface. This line is probably more for the purpose of branding. An infotainment system adds character to a vehicle, and you may be sure it is part of the consumers' purchase decisions. Just like any automaker, FCA tries to ensure that its in-vehicle technology is a cut above the rest. For those wondering how the Chrysler Android-based Uconnect system will look like, a version completely powered by Android Auto has already been teased during the Google I/O event last May inside a Maserati Ghibli. In partnership with Qualcomm, FCA showed off a 15-inch, 4K touch screen infotainment system that recalls the form factor of the same dashboard technology found in Tesla.

Savitribai Phule was an educator and a social worker who urged for the education of women, during British India. Phule founded India’s first women’s school in Pune, and was also India’s first woman teacher. Every year, January 3 is celebrated as Savitribai Phule Jayanti, with programs held for women’s empowerment in her honour. Savitribai Phule was born in Naingaon in 1831. She was only nine years old when she was married to her husband, Jyotirao Phule, who was then fourteen years old. Jyotirao Phule encouraged Savitribai Phule to study. Later on, both husband and wife became social activists who fought for the rights of the downtrodden in Indian society, including those facing discrimination based on caste, women, widows and farmers. Savitribai Phule wrote a number of poems for the upliftment of dalits and women. Some of her poems can be read online here. This is a graphic novel illustrating the life of Savitribai Phule. The adopted son of Savitribai Phule and Jyotirao Phule, Yashwantrao opened up a clinic to care for patients affected by the third pandemic of bubonic plague, that raged for a hundred years. She was personally taking people to the clinic and caring for them, and contracted the deadly disease in the process. She died on 10 March 1897, because of the plague.

The bank decided to forgo any rollout after the test because of reliability issues — the system sometimes returned false or irrelevant information when it failed to understand a request, said Dominic Venturo, U.S. Bank's chief innovation officer. Today, reliability is much better with voice recognition technology, as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft are all investing heavily in their Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa and Cortana voice-based assistants. Banks are grappling with new challenges in trying to work with these voice assistants and securing transactions conducted through them. Some are debating whether to work with them at all. "We still must be thoughtful about what data will be passed into these third-party systems," Venturo said. "Right now we have to evaluate these one by one." Such challenges mean that 2017 won't be the year that voice banking takes off. Significant customer adoption of voice banking is three to five years away, said Emmett Higdon, director of mobile for Javelin Strategy & Research. Still, banks can't afford to stall their efforts around voice, given growing consumer use of the technology in everyday situations. Consumers will be using voice assistants across an increasingly varied array of devices: on smartphones, in connected cars, on wearable devices and on smart home devices like Amazon's Echo, the new Google Home or Apple's rumored Echo competitor. A recent Citigroup survey of general consumers with bank accounts found that 74% of the respondents were already using voice functionality to check weather, send messages and get directions. Growing adoption of voice assistants with these new types of devices will drive banks to explore new customer experiences that leverage touch, voice and other interfaces. Most major banks have rolled out some voice capabilities in their mobile apps, such as allowing customers to log in via a spoken phrase or password. The next important step for voice banking will be bringing voice assistants to mobile banking apps, Higdon said. In a Javelin survey this summer, half of the respondents — in this case, consumers who have used mobile banking — said they would be interested in using voice control within their mobile banking apps. "The problem is on the supply side — banks are not wading in," Higdon said. However, more banks will be experimenting in the coming year with developing their own voice assistants, he said. Bank of America announced in October that it planned to roll out Erica in 2017. The virtual assistant will be available within its mobile app and, when activated by a customer, will use artificial intelligence to offer basic financial advice via voice or text message. The bank has said that it wants to use Erica to bring some of the one-on-one personal service and advice normally reserved for its premier clients to the rest of its customers. Other banks will follow suit, with most likely to partner with companies like Nuance, Kasisto and Personetics that specialize in providing voice assistants, Higdon said. Such technology is a lot mature than when U.S. Bank tested it a few years ago. But U.S. Bank isn't saying whether it has plans to reconsider voice anytime soon. As for the step beyond that — letting customers use voice assistants from the tech giants to do banking tasks — banks have been even more hesitant. So far, Capital One is the only major bank that allows customers to check balances and pay bills through Amazon's Echo. Making payments, checking balances and transferring funds with these systems requires sharing account information through them. The technology underpinning virtual assistants such as Alexa in Amazon's Echo is all exclusively owned and tightly controlled by the tech companies that created them. So banks have to resolve the complex challenge of integrating their own applications with each one of these systems individually, Venturo said. And though Amazon, for one, encrypts all the data passing through Alexa, bankers like Venturo say an industry standard around tokenizing or encrypting data that passes through such systems would be helpful. Despite the challenges banks have in working with third-party assistants like Alexa, Carey Kolaja, global chief product officer for the Citi FinTech unit, expects such assistants will play a big role in helping customers make payments and online purchases going forward. "Not every transaction will be optimal on every device, and an experience that's optimal for one customer might not be optimal for another," she acknowledged. As an example, Kolaja recounted overhearing a woman at a Starbucks pulling out an iPhone and telling Siri to set a reminder to pay her phone bill. "I do not believe that woman would have been comfortable in a public forum asking Siri to move $1,000 from her account to another person's," she said. "So we need to build our products and services on a flexible open architecture that allows us to be responsive [to customer preferences]," Kolaja said. This adoption of voice commands means that customers will intuitively understand the value proposition behind voice banking — it will make routine banking tasks far easier. For example, banks have struggled for years with making their various products and services easy to discover on mobile devices through menu bars and other tools. With voice recognition technology, a simple spoken query could bring up the bank's relevant products and services, said Patrick Kelly, assistant vice president of emerging technologies at USAA. This would eliminate the need for the clunky menu option — classically represented by stacked lines that are often referred to as a "hamburger" — in banking apps altogether. Voice also could create entirely new customer experiences, Kelly added. For example, customers could conduct banking and shopping transactions using multiple devices simultaneously. A customer could ask their Echo to pull up their investment portfolio on their smart TV, prompt the Echo to make some transactions, and see the impact on their portfolio's balance displayed on the TV screen. This would be much faster than tapping or swiping on a touchscreen or TV remote to individually find each asset that the customer wants to buy or sell, allowing the customer to get back to their Netflix binge more quickly. "This is something that we've been thinking about as omnichannel 2.0," Kelly said. "We can already allow a customer to start a transaction in one channel and then finish it in another. That was the first stage. But doing it across multiple devices simultaneously, that's the next step." USAA happens to be ahead of most of the industry when it comes to voice. Besides allowing customers to log into its app via voice, it also uses Nina, the virtual assistant from Nuance. As virtual assistants become "smarter" and more context-aware, their conversational capabilities will present new opportunities for delivering financial advice and education. The Swiss bank UBS recently announced a customer pilot using the Echo to answer customers' questions about investments and the economy. However, banks' initial efforts with voice assistants need to stay grounded in simple, repetitive tasks like checking balances or searching for a transaction, Javelin's Higdon said. This will help acclimate customers to routinely using voice, so they will eventually feel more comfortable doing so for more complex transactions. "It's important to keep it simple and straightforward," Higdon said. "You don't want to throw too much at the consumer too quickly."

Chase Roberts is leaving for Silicon Valley on Friday, "The acceptance rate of a Google internship is less than Harvard. For 2015, 40,000 kids applied for a Google internship and 1,500 got in. That's a 3% acquisition rate, where at Harvard, it's 6%. It's actually easier to get into Harvard than to get into Google."   He says persistence is key. He'd know. Roberts, a junior at RPI in New York, applied three times for the coveted spot, using each rejection as a way to build up to where he needed to be.   Roberts says, "From that failure, I was able to get a different internship at a company in New York City called Bloomberg. They taught me how to do distributive computing, because of that one thing they taught me, a team at Google, when I reapplied and got through the interview, specifically wanted me for that one reason. That's how I was able to get in."   Exactly how it works isn't something I'd be able to explain - but it could relate to driverless cars, and it involves getting robots to learn how to open doors.   Roberts, "There are 100s of thousands of different types of door knobs, and to be able to program a robot to open every single door knob, it's very difficult. Too much to program, too difficult to do. We're going to program the robot to do these types of things."   -- KEYC News 12.

Now, Delphi is shifting from stunts to selling. In Las Vegas this week at CES, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, the company will give test rides to hundreds of potential customers in driverless Audis over a course of rugged terrain and tunnels. The goal: to walk away from this critical conclave with a handful of hot prospects for its self-driving system. Tesla Model S equipped with Autopilot Photographer: Christopher Goodney/Bloomberg “The last two years at CES have been more about just showcasing the technology and saying, ‘Look what it can do,’" said Glen De Vos, Delphi’s vice president of advanced engineering. “This year, the discussion is all about the path to production." Self-driving cars are finally making the leap from the lab to the showroom. Tesla Motors Inc., BMW, Ford Motor Co. and Volvo Cars have all promised to have fully autonomous cars on the road within five years. Alphabet Inc. just spun off its Google Self-Driving Car Project, renaming it Waymo, and then promptly unveiled its driverless Chrysler Pacifica minivan and said it’s in discussions to put its technology into Honda Motor Co. models. When CES officially opens Jan. 5, the talk won’t be about proving technology -- it will be about selling to automakers, ride-hailing companies, transit services and, ultimately, consumers. “We’re close to bringing this to a lot of people,” John Krafcik, the former auto executive now running Waymo, said at its formation. “We’re kind of at an inflection point.” For a QuickTake on issues surrounding driverless cars, click here. At a show once known for mobile phones and video games, vehicle technology will cover an exhibit space the size of four football fields, some 21 percent more than last year. Some 138 auto-tech exhibitors will all be seeking a piece of the autonomy business that Boston Consulting Group says will increase to $42 billion by 2025 and account for a quarter of global sales by 2035. And since it takes about four years to bring a car to market, now is the time to cut deals with suppliers and tech partners to outfit models with self-driving systems that will debut early next decade. Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivan equipped with Waymo technology Source: Fiat Chrysler Automobiles “CES 2017 marks the beginning of a new era,” said Luca Mentuccia, senior managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant Accenture. “Autonomous driving has become the next major battlefield.” Prius Problem One reason for the push to get robot rides on the road is fear of the so-called Prius problem, according to Mark Wakefield, managing director and head of the automotive practice for consultant AlixPartners. The Prius became synonymous with hybrids after Toyota Motor Corp. pioneered the technology almost 20 years ago. Today, the Prius still dominates the market for gas-electric cars. “Nobody really wants to be the competitor to the Prius, where you let one company effectively frame the experience in the buyer’s mind,” Wakefield said. “Then when you come out with one, it’s like, ‘Oh, you make one, too?”’ Google’s self-driving car project has garnered the most attention as it clocked more than 2 million miles of road testing over the last seven years. Waymo hasn’t yet revealed its business model, but it can draw from the success of the Android model its parent company employs in the smartphone market. Unlike traditional automakers, Alphabet’s businesses tend to focus on recurring revenue streams, such as search ads. Google’s Project Android, which powers four of every five smartphones sold globally, funnels money to Google services. Similarly, Waymo could build underlying software for autonomous vehicles, license it to carmakers and cash in on services and data. “Google’s playbook here is well-tested,” said Jonathan Matus, chief executive officer of Zendrive, a transportation data startup, who formerly worked on Android. “They understand how to use the platform to create dominance.” Consumers will probably get their first taste of automated driving in the backseat of a robo-taxi. Uber Technologies Inc. is testing a fleet of autonomous Volvo XC90 sport-utility vehicles in Pittsburgh and Arizona. Ford, which said last week its test-fleet will triple to 90 cars this year, says its first autonomous vehicles will go to ride-hailing and ride-sharing services in 2021. General Motors Co. plans to test self-driving Chevy Bolts in Lyft ride-hailing fleets in Arizona. Acclimating Consumers The idea is to get consumers so comfortable with the technology that they buy it for their own car. Volvo has said it will offer its self-driving system as a $10,000 option on the XC90 in five years. GM is developing a semi-autonomous system known as Super Cruise that will allow for hands-free driving on highways. “Chevy Bolts in a Lyft fleet will give people exposure,” Wakefield said. “As they gain confidence and think, ‘Wow, Chevy does some pretty neat stuff,’ GM is hoping that rubs off and convinces them to buy a Bolt with Super Cruise.” It also makes business sense to put the first autonomous cars into a shared-use situation. Because the sensors that give a driverless car a 360-degree view of its surroundings are still pricey, spreading the cost over all the riders in a robot taxi will help to defray the expense. “The high cost isn’t solved yet,” Wakefield said. “There’s not an assumption of making tons of money on this first generation or two.” Safety Improvements The dramatic improvements in safety that should come from semi-autonomous features such as automatic emergency braking will accelerate consumer demand for autonomy, according to Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley. “It took air bags 15 years to get high penetration in cars,” Jonas said.

Tesla is now outfitting all its cars with the hardware required to enable the robot to take the wheel. Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk says Tesla will soon be ready to flip the switch on the technology, which puts pressure on other companies to keep up. Just last week he tweeted a link to the dashboard video of a Model X whose warning chimed a moment or two before two other cars crashed ahead of it on a European highway. “Tesla is being a disrupter,” Wakefield said. “Instead of going slow and being methodical like other automakers, they put it out there and the others have to come up with a competing product.” Regulatory Changes Autonomy also is getting a boost from U.S. regulators, who in December proposed new rules that cars be embedded with chips to communicate with each other to help avoid accidents. Vehicle-to-vehicle communications, known as V2V, could arrive within five years and make driverless cars smarter and safer. “Every government agency we work with has been waiting for this rule,” said Jim Barbaresso, national practice leader for intelligent transportation systems for consultant HNTB Corp. Now “you’re going to see more momentum in connected vehicles and more activity among automakers." For Delphi and its partners Mobileye NV and Intel Corp., the first application of their self-driving system could be an airport tram or a rental-lot bus. By eliminating the human driver, autonomy could cut the operating costs of such systems by 70 percent, De Vos said. “The economics are really compelling,” said De Vos, who will be giving tram operators test rides in Delphi’s driverless car in Las Vegas. “After CES, we expect to really be getting serious with three or four customers.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The upcoming Android smartphone will officially be the second Google Tango phone following 2015’s Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Qualcomm revealed the Zenfone AR on a blog post earlier today which carried a publishing date of Jan. 4, according to GSM Arena. The blog post has now been taken down and it seems as though someone within the company inadvertently published the post in advance. The blog post detailed that the Asus Zenfone AR will be powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 821 processor, the very same chipset that’s in Google’s Pixel phones and Asus’s own Zenfone 3. A lot of people were expecting that the handset would come with the new Snapdragon 835, but Qualcomm says that the Snapdragon 821will be enough for the upcoming handsets’ Tango features, according to 9To5Google. Although it’s already been known previously that the Zenfone AR will be Tango-enabled, the blog post also revealed that it will be Daydraam VR-ready as well. This will make the Zenfone AR the very first handset to support both of Google’s Tango and Daydream software for Android. Related Stories ZenFone 3 Deluxe Special Edition To Arrive This Month Unannounced ASUS Chromebook Leaks On Newegg For the uninitiated, Google Tango is a tech platform that allows users to map out indoor environments through a smartphone’s dual-camera setup. The software uses augmented reality technology allowing a smartphone to see the world and detect distances without using on GPS and other external signals. Daydream VR on the other hand is Google’s own virtual reality platform which is baked right in the Android mobile operating system. Following Qualcomm’s accidental reveal of the Asus Zenfone AR, leaker Evan Blass also shared a press render of the upcoming handset on his Twitter page. Up front, the handset looks a lot like the Zenfone 3 with the exception of the physical home button and the Asus logo just beneath the earpiece. On the back, the Tango-enabled dual cameras and its array of sensors are clearly seen. Asus is expected to officially reveal the Zenfone AR at CES 2017 which kicks off this Wednesday in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The system is based off of Android 7.0 Nougat, skinned with Fiat Chrysler’s UConnect interface. It integrates Google apps like Maps and Assistant, as well as third-party apps such as Spotify and Pandora. The collaborative project is the latest in a partnership that has already produced 100 Chrysler Pacifica minivans featuring Google’s self-driving technology. The development also builds towards Google’s ambition of integrating its open-source Android into all user-facing aspects of the car — including the speedometer and climate control — which the company laid out at its 2016 I/O developer conference. The two companies have yet to state when infotainment system will become available to consumers, though more information may be forthcoming at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada.

Slim to none I’m sure yerallnuts Absolutely zero. There are significant hardware constraints, to name one issue. Chug that haterade Rather frustrating given my wife has a 2016 Chrysler vehicle and can’t use an app to remote start her vehicle. Troy Dobranski I have a factory remote starter in my 2014 Ram. Find a dealer to install a Viper Smart Start to interface with the factory system. I can start, lock, unlock, and even read DTCs on the phone and it’s all tied into the factory system. Chug that haterade Thanks for the tip. Do you mind sharing ballpark what it cost? Shogun No mention of QNX in this deal. BBRY fans are probably shjtting their pants Barry Harden Should’ve just stuck to the Android Auto platform. None of this custom interface with Uconnect nonsense.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 3 January 2017 | MYT 9:30 AM How Microsoft emerged from the darkness to embrace the Cloud by matt day In the clouds: Microsoft's Azure has gained traction in the past two years in part by using an old tactic: building off the company's relationship with business-technology buyers. — Reuters SEATTLE: The winter of 2010 brought some of Microsoft's darkest days.  Bing, the search engine Microsoft built to challenge Google, was burning cash with little to show for it. Smartphones for the first time surpassed the personal computer, Microsoft's comfort zone, as the world's most popular computing device. The must-have tech gadget that holiday season was Apple's new iPad.  Microsoft, a company at the centre of the technology world for decades, watched the future pass it by.  Steve Ballmer, Microsoft's chief executive, couldn't afford for that to happen to the company's sprawling business-software empire.  In a surprise move, Ballmer removed Bob Muglia, the leader of the company's fast-growing Server & Tools division. Muglia's departure in 2011 was the last in a string of exits that saw much of Microsoft's brain trust depart.  "It was really dreary," Muglia said of the mood at Microsoft then. "You basically saw a complete self-destruction of the senior leadership team."  But out of that chaos, the nadir of Microsoft's lost decade, the company found a rebirth in cloud computing.  Six years later, Satya Nadella, the man Ballmer tapped to succeed Muglia, is the chief executive of a reinvigorated Microsoft that is reaping the rewards of a bet-the-company push toward web-based software and services.  Microsoft stock hit all-time highs this month, a reflection of investor confidence in Nadella's pivot away from flagging consumer services like smartphones and toward business software delivered on the Web. A company that for much of the 2000s tried in vain to fashion itself in the model of Apple or Google found a better target in its back yard in Amazon.com.  Seattle-based Amazon grew up as an online retailer, but the company a decade ago pioneered the business of renting computer power and other technology infrastructure over the internet. Its Amazon Web Services unit, with sales of US$11bil (RM49.34bil) in the most recently reported 12 months, has a wide lead in that arena, analysts say.  Microsoft has pushed hard to catch up, spending billions on new datacentres and rewriting its software for delivery via the web.  Those investments are starting to pay off. Microsoft's sales of web-based computing infrastructure brought in about US$2.3bil (RM10.31bil) during the last year, analysts with RBC Capital Markets estimate.  That's a small portion of Microsoft's total revenue, and the service likely isn't profitable yet. But it represents a vital new line of business for a company that relies on a stagnant PC market.  "There's a realization that the conventional wisdom about Microsoft was wrong," said David Smith, an analyst with researcher Gartner. "They saw the tremendous success that Amazon was having, and they adapted because of that."  Gates' involvement  Microsoft's cloud-computing work started in earnest in 2006, the same year Amazon launched Amazon Web Services.  The goal wasn't to emulate Amazon. Instead, following the ill-fated engineering effort that put together the Windows Vista operating system, a small team of senior engineers started working on stitching together the plumbing behind Microsoft's online services, from Hotmail to search.  A road show and listening tour ensued, with a crew of six engineers piling into a minivan to learn from Microsoft's web-focused units in Silicon Valley.  Back in the Seattle area, the team set up a skunk-works lab in Microsoft's Building 28. It didn't advertise its work to colleagues, most of whom were plugging away on packaged software releases.  "We hid," said Yousef Khalidi, an engineer who was among the first to join the project. "The idea of moving away from shrink-wrapped software was, at the time, radical."  It wasn't long before Bill Gates asked to review the team's work. The co-founder's official role at the company was limited to a board seat, but he still kept a close watch on Microsoft.  Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said the team wasn't ready.  Gates wouldn't take no for an answer. He insisted, meeting the team in a small conference room one Friday morning and grilling it on its progress.  The following Monday, Gates called another meeting. The project was great, he said, but he wanted the team to go public with its work.  Overnight, the mission had changed from building tools for Microsoft employees to creating a new product for customers.  Bolstered by the addition of a few dozen employees, the team spent years building the first version of what was called the Windows Azure cloud-computing platform. It launched in 2010.  The initial product wasn't very good. Azure was difficult to use, and despite its "Windows Azure" branding, it couldn't run off-the-shelf versions of Windows Server.  The team's biggest bet – that businesses were interested in using web-based tools to build new and futuristic applications – proved to be a dud. Most companies wanted the cloud to replicate something they already did.  "Something big going on"  Microsoft did have a model for what would work.  In 2008, Server & Tools chief Muglia and Andy Jassy, the leader of Amazon Web Services, or AWS, struck a deal.  Some AWS customers wanted to run Microsoft's software on Amazon's infrastructure. Muglia agreed to add Amazon to a program for companies that rent Microsoft tools to their own customers, and pay Microsoft at the end of each month based on how much they used.  Amazon at the time wasn't telling investors much about how AWS was doing. Microsoft, though, had its own indicator: the large and growing number of Microsoft products Amazon was paying for every month.  "We knew that there was something big going on there," said Bob Kelly, a former Microsoft executive.  Microsoft and Google by then had launched competing services, but it was upstart Amazon that was capturing the most customers.  New head of team  Nadella took over Server & Tools in 2011 with a mandate to push harder on cloud computing, colleagues say.  It didn't matter whether customers were ready for web-based tools, the thinking went. The industry was going that direction, and Microsoft could try to lead or risk getting left behind.  "Very quickly, the world changed," said Khalidi, who leads Azure's networking teams today.  Nadella placed Scott Guthrie, a career Microsoft engineering manager, in charge of the Azure team.  One of Guthrie's first moves was to gather Azure's leaders at an off-campus retreat for an experiment: He asked them to try to build an application using their own cloud service.  It didn't go well. Some features didn't work, and some managers failed to complete the online sign-up process to use Azure. "We didn't have everything quite right," Guthrie said.  The team rewrote Azure, with a focus on ease of use and the sort of tools Amazon was having success with. It also had to unlearn lessons from decades spent selling out-of-the-box software.  In the old world, how a product performed was a customer-service issue, walled off from engineers working on adding new features.  In the world of live web services, customer service became part of the engineering work.  Nadella instituted weekly meetings in which senior leaders spent hours delving into how customers used Microsoft services, as measured by about 3,000 metrics.  If a portion of Azure's network fails in Southeast Asia, for example, "We want to know why, and we want to know in an excruciating depth what we are doing to make sure it doesn't happen again," Guthrie said.  Revenue isn't discussed. "We focus on customer metrics, and what we find is when we improve them, our revenue keeps going up," he said.  Azure relaunched in 2013 with a set of infrastructure services that performed many of the same functions as Amazon's AWS.  Symbolic switch  A month after Nadella replaced Ballmer as CEO in 2014, he signed off on a cosmetic, but hugely symbolic change. "Windows Azure" was renamed "Microsoft Azure."  Windows had been the center of Microsoft's universe for decades. Products had to play well with the operating system or else they wouldn't last long.  Dropping "Windows" was strategic, a reminder to potential customers that Azure could run more than Windows. It was also symbolic of the cultural shift Nadella was trying to engineer as Microsoft, formerly hostile to software built outside its walls, had decided to play nice with Azure.  "He said our business is cloud first, and we have to move away from the shackles that they were tied to in Windows," said Dave Bartoletti, an analyst at Forrester.  Microsoft's Azure has gained traction in the past two years in part by using an old tactic: building off the company's relationship with business-technology buyers.  Most companies buy one Microsoft product or another. Jerin May, a business-technology consultant with West Monroe Partners, says he sees that familiarity paying dividends.  Microsoft's "commercial cloud," which includes sales of Azure, Office 365 and other web-based business software, was on track in September to bring in US$13bil (RM58.31bil) over a full year.  Nadella, Guthrie and Khalidi are typical of the new Microsoft: soft-spoken managers with deep backgrounds in engineering. The company retains its sprawling bureaucracy and penchant for meetings, but introspection and data-driven analysis are in vogue.  Combativeness, particularly when talking about the competition, is out.  Asked in an interview about the rivalry with Amazon, Guthrie, who now leads Microsoft's Cloud and Enterprise group, tipped his cap to his the Seattle company.  "We have a lot of respect for our friends across the lake," Guthrie said. "Our approach has always been, when working on Azure, let's not sort of thump our chest and make claims. Let's actually deliver a better product." — The Seattle Times/Tribune News Service You May Be Interested Boosting women's libido Glass discards now included in waste separation law Better rates via online forex services Paying high interest rates for personal loans Purple should be your favourite CNY colour Chinese herb Dang Shen helps to boost strength Others Also Read An odorous problem in OUG Travel fair targets expats who holiday locally Do we really need to fear China money? advertisement Latest News QLED vs OLED PCs on the rise Startup pays real people to answer questions to build better AI Dell Vostro 14: Value for money Could your gadgets send you to jail?

He added it will be difficult for China's foreign trade to improve in 2017 due to rising costs and other factors. China is the world's largest trading nation. It could be heavily exposed to protectionist measures this year if Trump follows through on campaign pledges to brand it a currency manipulator and impose heavy tariffs on imports of Chinese goods.

And now the auto and tech giants are joining forces to upgrade the generally mediocre state of in-car infotainment systems. FCA and Google announced Monday that the companies would unveil the latest iteration of FCA's Android-based infotainment system dubbed Uconnect at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas Jan 5-8. Currently, many newer cars feature in-dash head units that are compatible with Android Auto and Apple's Car Play, systems that essentially provide limited access to key apps — such as contacts and maps — living on the driver or passenger's smartphone. But FCA's new Uconnect concept, which is powered by the latest version of Android, Nougat 7.0, aims to broaden the smartphone's functionality within the automobile, offering access to a broader and more customizable suite of apps. FCA and Google are eight months into a deep collaboration on self-driving car technology, with the automaker providing Google's recently renamed autonomous car company — Waymo — with 100 Chrysler Pacificas packed with the Mountain View, Calif-based company's self-driving sensors. “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” Chris Barman, FCA's head of electrical engineering, said in a statement. “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications," he said. Google director of Android engineering Patrick Brady added that the companies are "committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way." Consumers increasingly expect to port their smartphone lives over to their vehicles with minimal fuss. Tesla has made a name for itself by offering one of the largest, vertically positioned screens available in a car today. All of the car's functions are controlled from the 17-inch screen. FCA's new Uconnect will be showcased on an 8.4-inch screen inside a Chrysler 300. The other reason for automakers to further refine hands-free smartphone-based infotainment systems is legal. Although holding your phone and talking while driving is already banned in 14 states and and text messaging is banned in 46 states, the rules just got more strict for California drivers. Beginning Jan. 1, residents of the Golden State are prohibited from holding and operating their phones for any purpose unless it is mounted to a dashboard, and even then only one-touch swipes are permitted.

(KABC) KABC By Lori Corbin Monday, January 02, 2017 PLAYA VISTA (KABC) -- We can ask chefs, grocers, and food forecasters what's the latest flavor, but we also know what's trending by counting searches on sites like Google and Pinterest. Gluten-free continues to be the biggest health food search on Google, while Pinterest found searches for Naan pizza up 175 percent. "Naan is a great bread alternative. It's good for things like pizza crust," said Janette Rizk of Whole Foods Markets. Rizk said their researchers found tonics and tinctures topping sales. Bone broth, turmeric lattes and juices were also a hit. Juicing is also a way to develop products from byproducts, which cuts food waste. "There's watermelon water that is made from ones that maybe aren't as pretty that are turned into cold pressed juice," said Rizk. Beyond sushi, Japanese-inspired street food is hot: Miso, mochi, noodles, and seaweed are all big sellers. Milk alternatives fill the fridge, including hemp, flax, grains, even peas. "We created Ripple to be dairy free the way it should be which is high in protein, low in sugar and really delicious. It's made from yellow peas believe it or not," said Ripple's co-founder Adam Lowry. It's also the year for the color purple. "We're seeing purple everything. Purple cauliflower, asparagus, sweet potatoes. It usually means there's more antioxidants," said Rizk. It's also found in chips and snacks. Sugar continues to take the heat as the bad guy while fat has been exonerated with research showing health benefits. And with new nutrition labels coming out in 2018, food manufacturers are looking for a sweet balance from sugars added to those naturally occurring in food. "We ship nationally right to your doorstep. The whole goal is to make food that is healing, foods that's inspiring to eat," said founder of Urban Remedy, Nica Pasquale. Meal delivery plans even meal kits are more fine tuned. Plus, groceries and restaurants are using third-party delivery systems like Instacart so you can have it when you want it without going to get it.

Havas January 2, 2017 4:10 PM Tags: bots, chatbots, chief intelligence officer, Havas Image Credit: mickyso/Shutterstock Machine intelligence (MI) is fast outgrowing its cradle in the technology department. This calls for a new, high-level executive function and a strategic roadmap. In this article I’ll outline some areas for your new CMIO to crack during 2017 and beyond. At a time when machines are learning how to run brick-and-mortar retail stores, starting to beat doctors in diagnoses, and even inventing their own secret languages, it’s natural for machine intelligence to raise questions and issues. Having had the privilege to work on and oversee many MI* projects already, and diving deeper into the topic with each passing day, I see the future bringing more boon than doom for companies and individuals alike, as long the benefits and challenges are tackled with seriousness. One of the strongest predictors of a society’s well-being is its productivity, and machine intelligence is bound to be a productivity beast: IBM Watson handles in seconds or minutes what would take a doctor, a lawyer, or their back office teams weeks or months of work; Amazon’s Go store uses MI to enable a lightning-fast retail experience without checkouts; Google’s MI already translates from and to languages it hasn’t encountered before; and Salesforce’s enterprise MI can dramatically cut administration, reporting, and coordination efforts, which now suck up over 50 percent of management’s time. All this will give people more time to think, manage other people, use judgment, and simply work with things that bring them joy. Undoubtedly machine intelligence, like all technological disruptions, will bring also challenges, and will likely make the internet revolution look tiny in comparison. Still, while it’s widely seen as key to future success, details and comprehensive roadmaps are often missing, as is the sense of where MI should even live within the organization. In my point of view, it should be key to any large company’s strategy, and it should be led by a senior leader who reports directly to the CEO. These chief machine intelligence officers, or CMIOs, will be tasked to bring all business departments, as well as the company as a whole, to the machine intelligence age. If you are one of these people, or looking to hire one, below you’ll find some key CMIO-level challenges to tackle. Business imperatives Where are the hidden connections awaiting discovery? What are the key things you should be able to diagnose and predict in real time? Which routine but massive tasks should you automate? Where should you use fast, contextual customization and real-time optimization at scale? These are some of the most promising areas of MI’s value in business use. The CMIO will need to have a thorough understanding of the company’s environment, its business processes, and their relationships to assess the biggest opportunities as well as the most acute urgencies. In some areas, MI won’t even be bringing competitive advantage — it’ll be the price of doing business. The adoption rate of new technologies has accelerated dramatically throughout history, and we now have the mobile internet, accessible cloud services, and much of the Internet of Things already in place. MI can in this setting take over entire industries faster than preceding technologies did, and will lead a deep transformation of the organization’s operating models. How will, for example, Google make money when we don’t browse through search results anymore, but simply pose a question and expect one right answer, as well as instant execution? Laggards will face hardships and even extinction, as did stubborn incumbents facing internet-born companies. Only this time, the effect is bound to be even more dramatic. Customer value Alongside machine intelligence, design thinking and customer experience management will be critical concepts for business success in the near future. People are not rational calculators, and they often value soft experience factors even more than hard, objective value. MI holds vast potential in providing more valuable experiences to people, and the CMIO needs to work with design departments and agencies to unearth these opportunities. MI can streamline the everyday, remove tasks to get jobs done, make the previously impossible possible, empower and educate people, tailor and personalize products and services, enable important connections with people and things, make experiences safe and secure, and enable completely new forms of storytelling and entertainment. These are just some areas for innovating experiences, but across all of them, seamless transitions between platforms and devices will be key. And MI will not touch just the what. My friend Alexander Manu’s upcoming book will revolve around the insight that in the behavior economy, the delivery (the how) is indeed the whole value proposition (the what). Chatbots and cognitive personal assistants are already making many common tasks smoother and more automatic, and learning about their masters as they go. Mind also that you have both internal and external customers. Externally facing applications are usually instantly viable where problems are simple and ample data available. Where problems are murkier and data exploratory or scarce, it’s still often better to build decision and support systems for your staff. Their experience in dealing with customers and customer data can thus be greatly enhanced. Autonomy and interaction How much autonomy to give the MI solutions working with and for your customers, staff, and other stakeholders is a key question. Ideally, intelligent systems should take care of mundane tasks all by themselves, but even where they already can, people might not yet trust them. The fact that Google’s AIs Bob, Alice, and Eve figured out how to speak to each other in a language humans can’t decipher made some people worried. And as already happened years ago, haywire trading bots have caused flash crashes and millions of damage. In his book Superintelligence, Nick Bostrom divides machine intelligences into three levels: Oracles tell their users what they need to know, like Google Search has done for a couple of decades now; Genies can carry out their masters’ wishes, but only upon request, the way Siri now works; and Sovereigns require only a few key principles to operate independently on behalf of their hosts. While true sovereigns don’t yet exist, robot portfolios by brokerages can be considered their present-day relatives. Whichever level of independence you set on, CMIOs also need to lead the development and monitor the performance of the company’s MI interaction practices. MI systems increasingly interact with users via text and voice, sometimes also called the “interface of least resistance.” Gartner predicts that within four years, 30 percent of searches will be done without a screen; first via voice, then maybe via brainwaves. While conversation is the most human of interactions, it’s not always the most natural medium for brands. Instead of logos, tag lines, and other common brand assets, the brand’s essence will distill down to questions, answers, micro-interactions, sentiment, and style of conversation, even pauses. These will become important business and brand factors, and metrics and analytics will need to evolve to reflect these nuances. Architecture A key task for the CMIO, together with the CTO, COO and/or CFO, is to figure out the technical architecture of machine intelligence, along with a roadmap and investment plan. The MI ecosystem is already a flowering and fast-growing garden with a mix of cloud services and on-site solutions, as well as hardware and sensors available for companies large and small, for core and support functions alike, and customized for different industries and sectors. The technology stack also includes several levels vertically, from understanding natural language and abstract concepts to data collection, data sciences, and machine learning, as well as general-purpose libraries and MI training grounds. There are already many vendors of ready-to-use capabilities and APIs, and also lots of free or cheap resources to build your own solutions from scratch. While open source, free-to-use libraries like Google’s TensorFlow might sound great at the outset, think before embarking on a quest to build MI in-house. Even though the basic tools might be free, you’ll need a cadre of experienced scientists and specialists to develop the self-improving machine intelligence models and algorithms. This is not easy: Capable people are hard to find, not to mention expensive. In StackOverflow’s survey, only 0.1 percent of respondents recognized themselves as machine learning developers, and 1.9 percent had a background in math or statistics, key skills for MI development. Even with easy-to-use interfaces and options to train MIs by talking to them, you’ll still need the experts when something needs fixing or tweaking. So, rather than trying to best Google, Salesforce, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, and Facebook in a global talent hunt, partnering with these companies is a viable option. It will also bring in the added benefit of combining the big players’ MI stacks with the tools you already use daily. Especially for niche, specialized purposes, there’s an ever-growing selection of small but potentially very suitable providers. But remember also that in machine intelligence, scale is usually a benefit, since bigger data means faster and better learning opportunities. Learning An MI system needs to learn constantly, because it’s just a baby at its release. In fact, researchers are now creating virtual babies to help them understand how babies learn and teach computers to learn faster. Charting out learning goals and strategies for the company’s MI initiatives is a critical task for the CMIO. Constant streams of data play a critical part in learning, and a rule of thumb for data for MI is “the more the better.” A key strength of MI is that it doesn’t need to take samples — it can learn directly from all available data, making insights and predictions more solid. While it’s great to have a theory (or even just a guess) about how the data and the problem might link, remember that MI can help make novel connections, find new opportunities, and answer the questions you haven’t even thought to ask, so long as there’s troves of data available. Different problems will require different learning paradigms, with reinforcement, supervised learning, and unsupervised learning being a few of the most well-known methods of machine learning today. For training purposes there’s already an ecosystem: Elon Musk’s OpenAI just opened Universe, which provides tools for everyone to train, measure, and evaluate intelligent systems; OpenAI Gym is used to train reinforcement algorithms; and Microsoft has open-sourced its Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit to speed up development of MI applications and is gaining traction. If even the most secretive tech company, Apple, is opening up its MI research to the wider academic community, it should be clear that the future of MI leans on collaboration and collective learning. A good way of thinking about training your intelligent system is making it a game, with triggers, actions, failures, and successes, as well as reward and feedback loops, that can be easily understood by people and machines alike. The research company L2 aptly sums the importance of learning by outlining the formula for value in the future as: amount of data sensors available × actionable intelligence that can be fed back to the system = value proposition. People Last but not least, the CMIO will need to tackle the human component of intelligent systems, as MIs don’t yet manage on their own. People are required simply to behave in ways that leave a data trail that the MI can measure, learn from, and apply to new situations. But humans are also needed to intermittently check data, tweak algorithms, provide training sets, and coach the MIs on their correct and incorrect judgments, as well as manage situations that the MI isn’t able to independently resolve. Reinforcement learning and supervised learning require more of the human component, while unsupervised learning lets the machine learn on its own. That last one, however, is still the most experimental of the three, and even unsupervised systems don’t (yet) build themselves. Google AI Experiments is an engaging example of how everyone on the internet can be harnessed to play with intelligent systems, and train them in an open learning environment. A thing to keep in mind is that MI systems are still built by people, so they can perpetuate their creators’ biases if this is not properly controlled for. This does not just concern the scientists creating the algorithms, but also the annotators labeling the training sets. As a practical example, when measuring on a scale of 1 to 5, women rate the same puppies 0.16 stars cuter on average than men do. This is a statistically significant divergence, and it matters if you’re teaching your MI about the concept of cuteness, for example. Even with a seemingly perfect system, the CMIO still needs to decide how much to trust the machines, how much control to retain, and how to establish checks and balances with people. As already mentioned, one of MI’s brightest promises is that it will allow your human components to focus more time on human work, such as judgment, socializing, and networking, as well as creativity. Over time, the need for control should diminish. Conclusion At Havas, we currently have many marketing and product initiatives utilizing MI underway, worldwide and across industries. Perhaps the one closest to my heart is still the “Most Confident Fan” initiative, which we created with our clients TD Ameritrade and IBM Watson, to provide a new take on TD Ameritrade’s NFL sponsorship. For the football season, we created an engaging web application that measured how the fans’ confidence about their team as expressed in social channels correlated with the team’s success. The first-of-its-kind solution fared surprisingly well. For example, it predicted every game of the NFL champions Denver Broncos correctly, including their winning the Super Bowl, in which many considered the Broncos the underdog. But no, unfortunately I didn’t bet on the Broncos. Machine intelligence will take over many sectors and verticals in the coming years. And the question is not if, or even when, but instead how are you preparing for the machine intelligence era? Considering machine intelligence a key strategic office in the company is a great first step. This article appeared originally on LinkedIn.

Some publishers are not so sure Google started AMP because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers Daisuke Wakabayashi  |  San Francisco  January 3, 2017 Last Updated at 02:19 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image.

MacStories, he declared, would no longer support a Google-backed method for faster loading of mobile web pages, called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). Viticci said MacStories’s pages already loaded quickly without Google’s help. He also didn’t like the idea of Google’s obscuring his site’s links — with AMP, they read google.com instead of macstories.net — in the interest of expediency. “Feels good” to no longer use the Google standard, Viticci wrote on Twitter. Viticci’s experience underscores the ambivalent relationship that some web publishers have developed with what was supposed to be Google’s great boon for mobile publishing. When Google introduced AMP, in October 2015, it said the new format would help publishers with one of their biggest headaches on smartphones: Browsing mobile websites was so frustratingly slow that many smartphone users abandoned pages before they opened. AMP has since delivered on its promise of faster mobile web pages. Even so, publishers — of smaller sites, especially, or individual bloggers — are beginning to worry about giving too much control to Google in exchange for zippier web pages. What’s more, Google’s approach to AMP has rankled some critics already suspicious of the company’s outsize influence on the internet. Much of the publishers’ unease is rooted in Google’s presentation of AMP stories, which appear as if they are Google articles. That’s because Google, to speed up AMP, stores copies of publisher’s pages and serves them from its own internet network. So when a reader clicks an AMP link, the address bar at the top of the page displays google.com instead of the actual web address from the publisher.  “It looks like a Google story,” said Danny Sullivan, founding editor of Search Engine Land, a web search news site. “That’s part of the reason why you’re getting the nervousness from some of these publishers.” Google said that it had designed AMP to prioritise speed and that it wanted to help — not harm — publishers, who get full accounting of traffic, data and advertising revenue. Publishers also retain control of their content and design. Google said serving up articles from its own internet network was the best way it knew to achieve the AMP speeds, which are as much as four times faster than a regular mobile web page. “We always try to present the content that is the best experience,” said David Besbris, Google’s vice-president of engineering. Google started AMP in 2015 because it worried that competitors like Facebook were drawing web surfers inside their networks with faster-loading articles and keeping them there. For Google, those rival sites were siphoning people away from the open internet, where the search company — which created the internet’s most valuable property by organising the expanse of the World Wide Web — typically operates. Now articles that use AMP appear prominently in Google search results on mobile devices. A Google search for “Donald Trump” on a smartphone brings back a horizontal carousel of articles from media organisations like Slate and The Wall Street Journal at the top of the page. If someone clicks the first story in the carousel, he or she is moved into a browser and can swipe instantly from one story to another without leaving Google’s network. Another benefit of AMP for Google is that it keeps activity on the web, and away from apps. More browsing on the internet means more web searches, and, in most cases, that means more Google. This is even more pronounced on mobile devices, where Google accounts for about 95 percent of all global web searches, according to StatCounter. Since AMP’s launch, the open-source project has won over many big publishers who praise Google’s responsiveness. They say readers are engaging more with ads on AMP because they actually get to the stories and it’s a better experience. There are more than 600 million pages running AMP on over 700,000 different domains, including publishers such as The New York Times and non-media sites like eBay. David Gehring, a former Google employee and the chief executive of Relay Media, a company that works with publishers to convert pages to AMP, said the format had been positive for publishers grappling with shrinking revenue in the shift from print to online advertising. He estimated that up to 10 percent of mobile web content was already on AMP. Yet Mr. Gehring also said Google suffered from “tone deafness” when it came to explaining the benefits of AMP, such as the ability for publishers to syndicate articles across the mobile web without losing advertising or traffic. That tone deafness has rubbed some publishers the wrong way. In October, the software developer Alex Kras created a stir when he wrote a post titled “Google May Be Stealing Your Mobile Traffic,” in which he recounted what had happened when he used AMP on his technology blog. After he enabled AMP on his WordPress publishing software, Mr. Kras said, his old posts displayed google.com and there was no easy way to redirect readers to his own site. “It made me feel like my site wasn’t my own,” Mr. Kras said. He later said the title of his blog post was inaccurate, but stood by his concerns that AMP could cost publishers mobile traffic, an assertion Google denies. Mr. Kras said smaller publishers had more to lose if they used AMP, since big publishers have more name recognition and readers are more likely to remember them as the source of a story. “Little guys like myself don’t have this luxury,” he wrote in another blog post after meeting with Google officials. Still, Mr. Kras decided to keep AMP because it was fast. “For that, a lot of little things can be (temporarily) forgotten,” he said. Google may be starting to acknowledge some publishers’ concerns. Last month, Google told Search Engine Land that it planned to make changes to AMP in 2017 to make it easier for publishers to offer their own links and for readers to be redirected to their sites. Google did not elaborate on its plans. Several bigger publishers say they are pleased with AMP and do not see anything worrisome with Google. “Google has been a good partner,” said Mark Silverstein, the head of business development at The Huffington Post, which is planning to push almost all of its news content into AMP. “When they make decisions, they do a good job of explaining why they reached that decision.” Emily Smith, head of content operations at Condé Nast’s Wired magazine, said supporting AMP had pushed its mobile articles to the top of search results. For web surfers conditioned to believe that the most relevant information is presented first in search results, it’s important for a media organization to be near the top. “It’s like being above the fold in a newspaper,” she said. About 15 percent of The Washington Post’s traffic comes from AMP pages. The Post is now using the lessons from AMP to move its articles to a separate, faster-running mobile platform that runs like an app but does so over the web. Joey Marburger, director of products for The Post, said that its readers were scrolling further on AMP stories, but that it was building its own fast system to gain greater control over ads and features. “We have to be where our readers are coming from,” Mr. Marburger said. “But it’s also important to have more control over our own content.” Read More On Google | Amp | Mobile Browsing | Facebook | Web Pages | Publishers PREVIOUS STORY NEXT STORY RECOMMENDED FOR YOU Advertisements Google helping mobile publishing?

Connect it to your phone’s headphone jack and use the built-in shutter button to actually snap your shots. 3-in-1 Clip Photo Lens Set – The 3-in-1 set that comes with this pack takes Fish-eye shots, Wide-angle shots, and Macros. Sadly, they’re a throw away item. Don’t get the set for the lenses because they don’t do a very good job. Ultra Bright 16 LED Photo Light – turns on and stays on to avoid red-eye and has three levels (high, medium and low) for the best lighting in each situation. The rechargeable built-in battery means it doesn’t suck juice from your Pixel. Flexible Tripod w/ Mount – photos taken on a tripod mount mean no camera shake, especially when you use the trigger below. This small tripod comes with flexible legs. It’s a little wobbly, so don’t rely on it. Bluetooth Remote Trigger – pair it with the phone’s Bluetooth and then snap shots remotely. This way you can get in the shot or reduce shake from tapping the screen or the volume buttons on the phone when you take a shot. It works up to 30 feet away. This, the Photo Light and the Selfie Stick make this kit worth the low price. Amazon sells them for only $23.50. This isn’t a high-end kit, and they’re a little flimsy and cheap. However, the remote and flash are worth the $23. The lenses will disappoint you and the tripod’s a little wobbly. Advertisement Olloclip Pivot Grip Taking video on a phone often means holding it in landscape to avoid the cracked door effect of videos shot on a phone in portrait mode. The great Google Pixel deserves the right technique. It’s uncomfortable to shoot video for more than a minute or two, but the Olloclip Pivot Grip helps users with longer videos. The grip comes with a clamp that holds the phone securely in place. A handle beneath the clamp feels like you’re holding a pistol. It’s easy to use and comfortable to shoot. The resulting videos look more stable even though you’re holding the phone while shooting. The Olloclip Pivot Grip costs $50 from Olloclip. Advertisement Joby GripTight Accessories The GripTight Pro with three Joby tripod solutions. The GorillaPod Pro, Micro tripod and GorillaPod Magnetic. The PoserSnap kit includes a tripod, but better ones are available from Joby. The Joby GripTight accessories include a few different models that we love. First, they offer the GripTight XL, a clamp that holds larger phones like the Google Pixel or Google Pixel XL. The 1/4″-20 universal tripod mount. The GripTight XL has a 1/4″ -20 universal tripod mount which connects to accessories like the GripTight Micro Stand, a tiny stand with three legs. You can also use the awesome GorillaPod, a taller tripod with flexible legs. They all range in price from $15 to $50. See our review of the GripTight GorillaPod Pro seen above. SanDisk Dual USB Drive Type-C You’ll need to back up those great photos, so get the SanDisk Dual USB Drive Type-C, which includes both USB Type-C and USB 3.0 connections on one tiny device. Plug it into the Google Pixel USB-C port and backup the photos and then plug it into your computer to store them or upload them to the cloud without using your phone’s battery. You can also more quickly get large videos from the phone to your computer for quick editing. Advertisement It’s got retractable connectors so you can protect the USB connection inside the flash drive’s housing. They’re available with storage sizes ranging from 16GB for $15 on up to 128GB for under $50 on Amazon. SereneLife PICKIT20 Portable Photo Printer The Google Pixel takes great photos on the go, but you can only enjoy them on the phone, unless you pick up the SereneLife PICKIT 20 portable photo printer. This little white mobile photo printer feels like carrying around a large battery. It’s only a few millimeters longer and wider than the Google Pixel XL and about three times as thick. Advertisement The built-in battery charges via a micro-USB cable. Your ink and paper all come in a single cartridge which you load into the side of the printer. It prints 20 3.5 x 2 inch photos. That’s only slightly bigger than wallet sizes, so the resulting printed photos aren’t that useful. My wife plans to use them in crafts with her first graders. Phones with NFC will pair with the printer automatically, if you can make it work. It failed on the Google Pixel XL. Instead, I loaded the PICKIT app and followed the instructions in the app to connect directly via Wi-Fi, which then connects the printer to your local Wi-Fi network and eventually prints over that network once you turn on the printer. The resulting prints, even though they’re too small for most uses, do look nice. Print images for your locker at school or craft projects like my wife does. It’s also helpful to get a quick look at a specific shot you really need to get right before leaving the scene of a beautiful subject. The app’s not great, but it works. You can edit and prepare photos in another app and then load them in the PICKIT app. Get the printer at Amazon for $119.99 and replacement cartridges cost $19.99 each for 20 prints. Epson Photo Printer Today, phone cameras take shots so good you may want to print them. Epson makes some of the best consumer grade printers, so we suggest going with them. The Epson Expression Photo XP-860 Small-in-One All-in-One Printer updated the 810 we recommended in the past. The printer makes beautiful color accurate prints quickly. It works on multiple forms of paper with two paper trays: one for smaller photo paper and one for larger letter or legal sheets. It also does a great job of handling printing directly from your phone or over a network. In addition to photo printing, it handles office tasks like auto 2-sided printing, copying, scanning and faxing. Connect using USB to a computer or network  using Ethernet and Wi-Fi. Epson has them on sale for only $200 at Amazon. If you don’t mind spending twice that, consider the Epson ET-3600 EcoTank printer. It comes with 2 years worth of ink in the box, but it’s $400. To save money, get the Epson Expression Premium XP-640 Small-in-One All-in-One Printer with scanning and copying in a small form factor for only $80 on Amazon.   One Response 01/02/2017 ammy96429 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

As our most important tool, ingrained into every aspect of our lives, they are stared at and handled more than the Princess Leias at Comic Con. Unfortunately, sometimes we lose and leave our fancy devices in mysterious places. Fortunately, there are ways you can track down your lost phone. Here's how. Before we get started, there are a few things to keep in mind. First of all, be aware that these methods all require you to have your location services turned on. Your phone will also need to be connected to the internet. Also: safety first. Remember that if you suspect any trouble when tracking your lost device, contact the police and hand your information to them. It's not worth putting yourself in a dangerous situation over a phone. iPhone/iPad Apple has a pretty ingenious toolset that will aid you in the quest to retrieve your phone. Of course there are downloadable apps that can be useful too but these native tools are better. One of my very lovely work colleagues once left her phone in a cab after being at showing. All her pictures and interviews were on the device, so it would have been catastrophic had she lost it. We managed to get it back within half an hour using the following steps and tools available at www.icloud.com. Find My iPhone Many people may not consider using the Find My iPhone application after losing their device because they simply haven’t set it up. You’ll be happy to know that, as long as you have a passcode set on your phone, Find My iPhone is automatically set up. Visit icloud.com and login using your Apple ID. These are the same credentials you would use to purchase things on iTunes or to download apps. Click on Find My iPhone in the top right hand corner. You’ll be presented with a map and a drop down menu with all the devices associated with that Apple ID. Select the device you are trying to locate. Once you've done that, you'll see a map that tracks the current or last active location of your phone. You'll also see a menu screen with three options, Play Sound, Lost Mode and Erase iPhone. Put Your Phone Into Lost Mode Do this before you do anything else. After clicking on Lost Mode, you'll be asked to enter a phone number that you can be reached on. You'll then be asked to enter a message. Both the message and the number will appear on the lock screen of your phone. If a Good Samaritan should find your phone, they'll be able to reach you. Once you get your phone back, simply type in your passcode and it will unlock and be good as new! Follow Your Phone On The Map If you've left your phone in a cab, on a bus or on a train, you'll be able to see it moving on the map. Keep your cab receipt or transport ticket, it will tell you the exact cab or bus/train that you were on. Call the bus/cab/train company and explain your situation, giving the number of the vehicle. Public transport companies will allow you to pick it up from the depot. With cabs, you can arrange to have it dropped back to your location for a fee. The same goes for Uber. If you've dropped it or left it at a restaurant, it should appear to be stationary on the map and this tracking system will allow you to retrace your steps and pin-point exactly where you may have lost your precious device. So after you've put it into Lost Mode, you’re able to physically hunt it down. Remember: don't put yourself in danger. If you feel someone has stolen your phone, hand the location over to police rather than put yourself in a potentially hazardous situation. Play Sound You've looked on the map and realised you've left your phone in a coffee shop, but on returning to the coffee shop, you still can't find it. This is where the Play Sound feature comes in handy. Even if your phone is on silent, the Play Sound function will make your phone play a looped sound so you can find it even if it’s wedged in a couch somewhere. This is also pretty handy if you’ve misplaced your phone at a party/at work/in your bedsheets during a Netflix marathon. Log into icloud.com and then click "play sound". It’s a lifesaver. And if you’re worried about this sound draining your limited battery, the Find My iPhone menu shows you exactly how much battery you have left – that way you can weigh your options. Erase iPhone Should the worst happen and you simply can’t retrieve your phone, Find My iPhone gives you the final option to remotely erase your phone. This isn't necessary for everyone, but if you've got credit card details, banking information, passwords or sexy photos stored on your phone, you may not want those falling into the wrong hands. Click "erase iPhone" and follow the prompts. You have permission to cry, as your device is now lost forever. It's worth keeping in mind that if you're prone to losing things like expensive iPhones, you should regularly back up your device to iCloud. That way you can restore it if and when you buy a new one. Alternative Tracking Apps iCloud and Find My iPhone are the best tools available to find a lost iPhone. As mentioned, I have used these tools and successfully retrieved a lost device within half an hour. But if you want to use something else, here are a few apps for iOS devices that are also quite good. GadgetTrak iHound Device Locator Android Finding your lost Android phone is easy, just Google it! That's right, you can Google where your phone is. This is a new-ish feature of the Android Device Manager. As long as your phone is linked to your Gmail account and you’re logged into Gmail in your browser, you can just Google the phrase "where is my phone" to find your device. Android Device Manager First of all, make sure that you are signed into your Google account in your browser. These are the credentials that you use to purchase apps from the Google Play store and also log into your Gmail. Once you’ve signed in, open a new Google search and type in the phrase "where is my phone." A map will appear at the top of the search results page. Click on it. You’ll be directed to a larger map with a menu box in the top left-hand corner. Click on the drop down device list to make sure that you have selected the correct gadget to track. Once you have done that, the map should show you the current or most recent tracked location of your phone. The menu box will also tell you how accurate the tracked location is and also the last time your phone was tracked. Lock The first thing you should do is lock your phone. In the menu box you should see a Lock option. Click on it. You’ll then be asked to enter a Lock password. Many of you will have already set a lock code on your phones. This feature will override that and lock your phone to a new password. Type in a password of your choice and try to make this a difficult one. Should your phone fall into the wrong hands, you will regret using a simple password. You'll also be asked to enter a short recovery message and a phone number where you can be reached. The message should be something akin to "Lost phone. Please return to Mia. Thank you!" Now if anyone should pick it up, this message will appear on the Lock screen and they will be able to contact you. It will also ensure that you keep prying eyes out of your personal data. Follow Your Phone On The Map The next few steps are very similar to the steps for finding an iPhone, which is great! If you need to help a distressed friend who is on a different platform to you, be rest assured that method and functions are extremely similar. Now that you've locked your phone, it’s time to pay attention to the map — if you've left your phone in a cab or on public transport, you'll be able to see it moving on the map. Keep your cab receipt or transport ticket, it will tell you the exact cab or bus/train that you were on. Call the bus/cab/train company and explain your situation giving the number of the vehicle. Public transport will allow you to pick it up from the depot. With a cabs, you can arrange to have it dropped back to your location for a fee. If you’ve simply dropped it somewhere, it should appear stationary on the map. The map tracking system will allow you to retrace your steps and pin-point exactly where you may have lost your precious device. But keep in mind the location accuracy in the menu box eg. Accurate to 21 metres. This means that you will have to search a 21 metre radius for your abandoned device. Ring Since the location of your phone on the map is not a pin-point location but a radial area, the Ring function offered by Android Device Manager is especially helpful. By clicking on the Ring icon, your phone will begin to ring as it normally would and you’ll be able to follow the sound — even if it’s on silent. Erase Android Device Manager also offers an option to remotely wipe your phone. In the instance that you are unable to retrieve your phone, you will want to consider erasing the data stored on your device. You don't want random people being able to look through your folder of selfies or gain access to your banking apps. To erase your phone, simply click on the icon and follow the prompts. So long, pretty Android. Alternative Tracking Apps Google's native toolset is the best way to find a lost Droid. But if you're looking for other tools, here are some other very reliable and efficient Android tracking apps. Find My Mobile (Samsung devices only) Plan B Where’s My Droid AntiDroidTheft What's your best tip for finding a lost device? Let us know in the comments! Comments jonno88 Guest Jun 18, 2015, 1:48pm Do Windows Phones have any of the same or similar features? Would be great to know as more and more people or switching to Windows devices Reply 0 Poribo @nightflarer Jun 18, 2015, 2:39pm I'm sure I came across the feature on my Lumia 930, called 'Find my Phone' or something like that. Don't know the specifics of it though, you might have to look it up.

Reply 0 djbear @djbear Jan 4, 2017, 9:49pm More and more people switching to windows phone? Not likely Their market share has shrunk more than half in the past 2 years. Was at 2% and is now less than 1%. WP is dying Reply 0 Jackson Bison @jacksonbison Jun 18, 2015, 1:54pm Android - not great if you're using 2 factor authentication... Asks me for my authentication code, which I can only access on my phone, which is apparently lost... Better to try the feature out first, before you lose you phone. Reply 0 quop @quop Jun 18, 2015, 4:14pm Use one of your backup codes - they're meant for situations like this. And, being a backup, they should obviously be stored somewhere other than only on your phone.

Reply 0 quop @quop Jun 18, 2015, 4:19pm Cerberus (android) is pretty good. Got a free licence for it years ago and was using it (and Where's My Droid) long before Android Device Manager was a thing. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsdroid.cerberus&hl=en Reply 0 pepee63 @pepee63 Jun 18, 2015, 7:09pm Ain't no way I'm going to lock my phone. I use my phone constantly and I'm not going to waste time unlocking it all the time. If I do lose it, my banking is safe behind a password and my photos are in the cloud. All my music is backed up on my computer and there is nothing on my phone that I give a damn about. I either find it or scrub it and get another phone the next day.

Thinking about putting it on my desktop but... maybe not. preyproject.com if anyones interested. Reply 1 leolamau Guest Jan 1, 2016, 11:39pm i lost my iphone 4s three times and return a iphone once to the owner. First time, accidently dropped it at Hume Highway. Used my wife's iphone and Find Iphone app to track it back to the exact location on the side of the road. Second time, dropped it while ridding on the bike, did not have access to another apple device so could not use Find Iphone app. But notice i lost it withing 10 minutes, so went back to the trail and ask the first person who was riding the bike and he got the phone. Third time, this time in Hong Kong. It fell off my pocket like the second time, but this time it had no sim card inside so no way to use Find Iphone app. But again realised it was lost within the first 10 minutes. Went back to food court, asked the cleaner and she said she handed it back to management. My parents who are not iphone users and dont now much about technology found a iphone 5s. So they just left it on, and it ran out of battery. After three months i got hold of this lost phone and attempted to return it back since i got my iphone returned back to me. This iphone 5s was passcode protected and i was in korean. I did some googling and some people recommended calling the telco and give them the IMEI number so they can contact the owner. So pop the sim to find the telco, Vodaphone. Called them and they kinda laughed at me for trying to return the phone back, anyway they had no trace of the IMEI number, i am guess they can only do search of the current activities, and given the phone had be lost for three months and more its no longer in their records for searching. I then tried connecting to my computer hoping to use some software to see the files inside or by pass the passcode, but no such luck, all software requires you to "trust" the computer and which requires the passcode to unlock the phone first. I then made the mistake of updating the iphone before search youtube for instructions of how to break the passcode. And there was plenty of exploit example, one involves using Siri, but Siri is only available if you have internent connections and other ways involves some key instructions but since i updated it to the latest OS, these exploits are no longer working. I then resorted to restoring the entire phone so i can by pass the passcode and then some how use the recovery too to undelete data. And then i found another security measure by Apple, is that if the owner of the phone uses Find Iphone app it will lock the account to the phone, and forever the phone cannot be unlocked by anyone else unless the owner removes this association. So tried the last thing i could think of (but should have tried it first), which is to put the sim to another phone and retrieve the phone number. And there it was the owner's phone number. I called it and she was surprised that someone found her phone. Luckily her sim was locked as well otherwise i would not be able to access the sim information. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Transit planners say 'smart roads' will prevent accidents from happening, cut down on travel time and help drivers save fuel. Although a few miles of highway in the US have new technology, states need to learn how roads can communicate with self-driving cars from different makers, as there is no standard on how cars receive data.

And many car makers say their self-driving cars will be safer than those with people behind the wheel and will reduce the 35,000 lives lost to traffic accidents each year, reports The Wall Street Journal.

Share this article Share 30 shares However, for autonomous vehicle owners to fully experience the capabilities of their machines, the roads have to learn a few tricks themselves. Planners say, 'smart roads can generate fuel savings by having cars drive at steady speeds, without stops and starts, and increase road capacity by enabling vehicles to travel closer together without risking traffic snarls or accidents,' reports The Wall Street Journal. Although just a few miles of roads in the US are packed with smart technology, the incoming president Donald Trump has promised to increase infrastructure spending. MICHIGAN FIRST STATE TO LET AUTONOMOUS CARS ON ROADS WITHOUT A HUMAN DRIVER  Companies can now test self-driving cars on public roads in Michigan without a driver or steering wheel under controversial new laws that could push the state to the forefront of autonomous vehicle development - at a price.  A new package of bills signed into law last Friday comes with few specific state regulations - leaving many decisions up to automakers and companies such as Google and Uber.  Michigan Transportation Director Kirk Steudle, who signed the bill, admitted there will be crashes and fatalities caused by the technology - but said 'it's a risk worth taking'.  And they allow the sale of self-driving vehicles to the public once they are tested and certified, according to the state.  The bills allow testing without burdensome regulations so the industry can move forward with potential life-saving technology, said Gov. Rick Snyder, who signed the bills.  The bills give Michigan the potential to be a leader by giving the companies more autonomy than say, California, which now requires human backup drivers in case something goes awry.  Police will investigate any crashes and presumably would report any trends to the state, which could suspend a company's manufacturer license plates and end the tests, Steudle said as he conceded that there will be crashes and probably a fatality involving autonomous cars.  But the technology can eliminate human errors that cause 94 percent of crashes and cut the 100 highway deaths in the U.S. every day, he said. But because many of the US roads are already in dire need of funding for maintenance, experts say it will cost billions of federal dollars to hookup more than 4 million moles of roads and 250,000 intersections. In November, Ohio announced it will be putting $15 million towards advancing self-driving highway technology in the state. Officials say that a four-lane section of Route 33 northwest of Columbus will become a corridor where technologies can be safely tested in real-life traffic, aided by a fiber-optic cable network and sensor systems slated for installation next year.  The first hurdle states will have to clear on this journey is how to make roads communicate with cars from different auto makers and technology firms. As of yet, there currently isn't a standard on how these machines can receive information from smart roads, nor how they handle alerts once they do get them. The first hurdle states will have to clear on this journey is how to make roads communicate with cars, like Uber's (pictured), from different auto makers and technology firms. There currently isn't a standard on how these machines can receive information from smart roads 'What we have is a chicken-and-egg problem,' says Utah transportation systems program director Blaine Leonard, who is chairman of a national committee on connected cars and roads run under the American Association of State Highway and Transportation. 'Cars right now don't have anything on them to talk to. Most of the installations [on roads] are for research purposes.' Utah is another state testing smart road technology on an area of Redwood Road in Salt Lake City. They've added sensors to the traffic lights in order to connect public buses, which also 'adjust red and green signals to help buses stay on schedule,' according to The Wall Street Journal. Virginia has fitted small DSRC devices to light polls and bridges, which 'watch' the road and give those at a control area change the speeds lane-by-lane depending on the traffic. This technology also transmits data to state government road-maintenance vehicles about what is happening on the roads in order for officials to know if adjustments need to be made. THE RACE TO SELF DRIVING CARS One of Google's self driving prototype 'bubble' cars Google's self-driving car In 2009, Google started the self-driving car project.  The testing fleet includes both modified Lexus SUVs and new prototype vehicles that are designed from the ground up to be fully self-driving.  Google's prototype two-seater 'bubble' cars have buttons to begin and end the drive, but no other controls. An on-board computer uses data from sensors, including radar, a laser and cameras, to make turns and negotiate its way around pedestrians and other vehicles. Under the vision unveiled by Google, passengers might set their destination by typing it into a map or using commands. Uber  In September, Uber revealed it had begun testing autonomous vehicles around Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A hybrid Ford Fusions with the Uber logo be used for mapping data of Steel City and testing its self-driving capabilities on public streets.  Included in the announcement is a photo of a hybrid Ford Fusions equipped with a variety of sensor, radars and high-resolution cameras. While the car is roaming around Pittsburgh, a trained driver will be seated in the driver's seat to monitor the vehicles performance -- but the car will be set in self-driving mode.  LEECo's LeSEE China's LeEco has unveiled an electric autonomous vehicle that it says will surpass Tesla's Model S in 'all aspects of performance'. Dubbed LeSEE, the sleek pearly white sedan has memory foam seats, Knight Rider-style voice activation, an automatic driving mode and a steering wheel that folds toward the dash when the car is set to autopilot. This futuristic concept car was engineered to be a 'smart', 'connected' and 'automated self-driving car' and the firm hopes it will set the stage for a fleet of autonomous taxis.  Utah  has added sensors to the traffic lights in order to connect public buses, which also 'adjust red and green signals to help buses stay on schedule,' according to The Wall Street Journal. It could also help cars like the Chevrolet Bolt (pictured) when it hits the road General Motors & Lyft's autonomous Taxis General Motors announced a $500 million investment in Lyft earlier this year as a joint effort to develop a fleet of self-driving taxis. Although the idea seemed like a distant dream, the duo has announced plans for a testing program on public roads by 2017. The program will use Chevrolet Bolt electric taxis and 'include real customers in a yet-to-be disclosed city'.   In addition to the testing program, Lyft is working on a new app that will be used for the autonomous cars.  The app is still a prototype, but will list the option for an autonomous car and there is a GM OnStar assistant to answer questions or report issues while you're en route to your destination.    Read more: States Wire Up Roads as Cars Get Smarter - WSJ Share or comment on this article e-mail 30 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background.

Freedman Staff Writer Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)January 2, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Lenovo's Phab 2 Pro soon won't be the only phone to support Google Tango. In a now-deleted blog post, chip-maker Qualcomm mentioned the Asus ZenPhone AR's specs before Asus had the chance to do so itself. GSMArena first spotted the post. For those unfamiliar with Google Tango, it uses multiple cameras and depth sensors to detect your position indoors to deliver an unrivaled augmented reality experience. For instance, you can place virtual furniture in your room, walk around dinosaurs and shoot at robots around you. MORE: Galaxy S8 Has Found Its Secret Weapon Against iPhone There are currently only a few dozen Google Tango-enabled apps in the Google Play store, but hopefully more developers will support the platform as more phone makers put their weight behind it. The phone will sport Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 processor and will be Daydream ready, making it the first Android handset supporting Google's VR and AR initiatives. Qualcomm's post reportedly highlighted apps like Fantastic Beasts, Google Street views and streaming apps. Following the announcement, renowned tech leaker Evan Blass posted press renderings of the device, which you can see above. We expect to learn more about the devices at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week.

(BigStock Image) With 2016 now in the rear-view mirror, it’s time to take a quick moment to forecast what might be looming on the horizon in the near year. Who better to ask than a group of venture capitalists, the money managers who are paid big bucks to see around corners and determine what technologies will impact our lives going forward. The new year certainly brings a set of challenges and opportunities, and this much is clear: No one really knows what will happen. As venture capitalist Loretta Little says: “what a year 2017 will be to predict anything!” Even so, we quizzed five Seattle area venture capitalists to get their take on what they think will transpire in 2017. Optimistic by their nature, all of the venture capitalists believe the Nasdaq will continue to surge, with one predicting a 25 percent uptick. They also see a steady stream of initial public offerings. In terms of hot sectors, they are bullish about cloud computing, artificial intelligence and personalized genomics, while many think the technologies behind autonomous vehicles are a bit overhyped. Here’s more from our five VCs: Bill Bryant, partner at DFJ Bill Bryant at GeekWire Startup Day 2015. (GeekWire photo) Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 (candidates): Three (Avalara, Avvo and a biotech whose name I don’t know). I can’t formally comment on Redfin’s plans as DFJ is an investor but would imagine that Redfin will look closely at its options as the year progresses Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 8-10 new investments (1-3 of which will be in Seattle) Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $845 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $88.88 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $845 Apple stock close on 12/31/17: ($115.82 now): $88.88 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,924 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: CRISPR, voice everywhere, personalized genomics and every smarter robots. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Machine learning/machine intelligence – not because its unimportant but because it (has) become basic tablestakes. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: I continue to believe we are very early on in the full transition of the enterprise to the cloud. Also, opportunities related to globalization (next billion coming online and entering the world economy), retraining and re-skilling initiatives aimed at those being displaced by automation, and the impact of renewable energy now being cheaper than fossil fuels. Advice to startups for 2017: We’ve had a remarkably forgiving five to seven year run where so many ideas seemed to work, at least for a time. The next five years will require more fortitude, a focus on ‘hard tech’ and solving deeply rooted societal problems.  We’ve had a remarkably forgiving five to seven year run where so many ideas seemed to work, at least for a time. The next five years will require more fortitude, a focus on hard tech and solving deeply rooted societal problems. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Facebook will find a way to buy, or bury, Snapchat. Microsoft will buy either SAP or Salesforce to consolidate its position in the enterprise. Bezos will purchase Twitter and consolidate it with the Washington Post. This will be an up or out year for VR/AR where it will start to generate a market and live up to early expectations – or not. The Bay Area will see a marked (10%+) decline in startup activity relative to locations like Seattle, Portland, Austin, Boulder and LA due to the cost of real estate and housing – startups and their employees will be priced out of the geography. The NBA will announce a return to Seattle. Tim Porter, partner at Madrona Venture Group Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 2 Madrona Managing Director Tim Porter. Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 10-14, consistent with our pace of the last several years. We continue to see many compelling opportunities and exciting new Pacific Northwest companies being formed, and so we plan to continue an aggressive investment pace. Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $875 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $67.50 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($748.87 now): $914 Apple stock close on 12/31/17: ($115.82 now): $115 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,825 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: AI and machine learning will continue to be the hottest and most important technological wave, infusing most/all sectors of technology, as all applications become “intelligent applications” over time.  AI and machine learning will continue to be the hottest and most important technological wave. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Autonomous Cars. I think we are moving down the path towards truly autonomous self-driving cars faster than most anticipated just a few years ago, and we will definitely get there. We will see continued incremental innovation and capabilities demonstrated in 2017. However, we will also see players run into the reality of the many challenges around this technology. I and Madrona are long-term very bullish in this field, but the hype feels like it’s at a fever pitch versus what the industry can actually deliver this coming year. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: I am extremely excited about enterprises continued move to cloud native computing, updating their architectures to a combination of cloud, containers and microservices. Within this, I think you will see the popularity of Kubernetes continue to increase (one of our drivers behind investing in Heptio). Advice to startups for 2017: Be scrappy with cash, maniacally focus on your customers and prospects, raise money on reasonable terms when you have the opportunity to do so, be very detail-oriented measuring and understanding your unit economics, and then be aggressive scaling when you see favorable and repeatable unit economics for acquiring and retaining customers. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Private company M&A will increase. Mariners will make the World Series. Loretta Little, managing director at WRF Capital* Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 2-3? Still probably low because there is a lot of private equity out there for solid companies. Perhaps Redfin and Adaptive Biotechnologies. Loretta Little Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: Our investments are based on a fiscal year (July to June). We have made two new investments since July 2016. I expect, in calendar year 2017, we will make 2-4 more. Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $850 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $70 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $850 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $130 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): Who would have predicted the market increases amid all the uncertainty? Will that change? 5,600. What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Tech: virtual assistants & natural language processing. Biotech: CRISPR/Cas gene editing system What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Tech-autonomous vehicles; Bio – I’m not going to pick a specific technology. What makes me crazy in the life sciences arena is when scientists publish a paper or report data at a conference and it gets hyped by others so members of the general public believe there is an actual product. This leads to unrealistic expectations and sometimes a distrust of science. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: No specific area. I invest in early stage companies, so I am generally an optimist and try to track across the healthcare spectrum. Advice to startups for 2017: Be able to concisely describe your business, your value proposition and your goals. Stay flexible and continually revisit your assumptions. Ask for input from a myriad of sources. You don’t need to agree, but you should always be listening. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: These aren’t bold — I think they are pretty realistic — more vegetables, more VR, Viaduct vagaries and vocal voters. *Loretta wanted to offer this caveat: “My focus is on life science/healthcare companies so my predictions on tech companies are based on general observation versus in depth industry knowledge. I noticed you didn’t ask about Seattle Genetics, Amgen or Cerner.” Bill McAleer, partner at Voyager Capital Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017 (candidates): Two: Avalara, Payscale or Offerup Bill McAleer Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: 4 Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $825 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $74 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $942 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $126 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 5,680 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Smart home applications; Text and chatbots emerge as a new channel for businesses to interact with customers What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Self-driving cars; also VR (virtual reality) as widespread adoption (once again )will be slow. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: Advanced analytics, AI and machine learning applications that optimize business processes and/or customer interactions; Advice to startups for 2017: Go solve real customer problems, not a perceived market opportunity; once you have a customer, make them happy and find ways to offer them more. If you have to raise capital, do it early in 2017 before the cost and availability of capital is more constrained. And don’t judge success by how much money you have raised, the most effective form of funding is revenue from satisfied customers and partners.  If you have to raise capital, do it early in 2017 before the cost and availability of capital is more constrained. Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: -Venture funding will get tighter and valuations will moderate; several unicorns will have financial issues buy the end of the year -Interest rates will rise by 200 basis points and appreciation in the housing market will slow. -F5 and Twitter get acquired. -Rise of populism continues in Europe, threatening the EU. -Seattle will settle on an arena option for basketball/hockey, with Chris Hansen leading the way to a deal. -Seattle Rep musical,  Come From Away, is a smash hit on Broadway. -Seattle continues to thrive as a major U.S. tech hub Molly Otter, chief investment officer at Lighter Capital Number of IPOs in Washington state in 2017: 4 Molly Otter Number of new investments your firm plans to make in 2017: Another record year for Lighter Capital.  We will double our deals again and do 200 in 2017. Google’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($771.82 now): $1,000 Microsoft’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($62.14 now): $95 Amazon’s stock close on 12/31/17 ($749.87 now): $1,200 Apple stock close on 12/31/17 ($115.82 now): $100 Nasdaq final close on 12/31/17 (5,383 now): 6,773 What will be the hottest technology of 2017: Techno-clothing like Seattle’s own Buki-Brand will become part of day-to-day wear. What will be the most overhyped technology of 2017: Virtual reality. I think we are going to find out who the winners and losers are in the VR space in 2017, with a lot of VR companies running out of steam/money. What business area are you most excited to spend time on in 2017: Continued use of big data to help reduce our cost of capital to our customers Advice to startups for 2017: Have a plan for getting to break even (you don’t have to be on it but at least know how you would execute it) Other bold predictions for 2017 in tech, politics, sports or anything else: Patriots win the Super Bowl (again)!

Victory for Google on fair use in Java API case In 2012 the jury in the first Oracle v. Google trial found that Google's inclusion of Java core library APIs in Android infringed Oracle's copyright. The district court overturned the verdict, holding that the APIs as such were not copyrightable (either as individual method declarations or their "structure, sequence and organization" [SSO]). The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, applying 9th Circuit law, reversed, holding that the "declaring code and the [SSO] of the 37 Java API packages are entitled to copyright protection." The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case, and in 2016 a closely watched second trial was held on Google's defense of fair use. In May 2016 the jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Google. As Jeff Kaufman explains, the verdict does not change the appellate ruling concerning API copyrightability, which, however, has limited precedential significance. Fair use involves a highly fact-specific determination, and the verdict has no obvious broader legal significance. Nonetheless the result was a clear victory for Google. Oracle has filed an appeal. Although Oracle v. Google is not a "case about open source" per se, it is notable that both sides are stewards of relevant open source platforms centered around Java development. Oracle leads the OpenJDK project, in which the APIs at issue in this case, if we regard them as copyrightable, are licensed under GPLv2 along with the Classpath Exception. The Android platform, which does not implement all Java core library APIs, is licensed mostly under the Apache License 2.0. Its Java core library API implementations were generally taken from the Apache Harmony project, which began as a pre-OpenJDK effort to develop an open source Java runtime. Late last year Google confirmed that Android Nougat would use GPL-licensed class library code from OpenJDK in place of the Apache Harmony code. 2. Censure of Patrick McHardy Since 2014 there have been rumors of GPL enforcement lawsuits being brought against many companies in Germany by Patrick McHardy, a Linux kernel developer who was formerly the chair of the Netfilter core team. There is some discussion of the McHardy litigation in a recent Black Duck/DLA Piper slide deck. Until 2016 there has been something of a taboo on open discussion of the McHardy lawsuits. This ended on July 18th, when the Netfilter project announced that it would "suspend" McHardy from the Netfilter core team, the first such action it had ever taken, because "severe allegations have been brought forward against the style of his license enforcement activities." Although the core team had no first-hand evidence for the allegations, which were consistent and came from "trusted sources," they noted that despite many attempts to reach McHardy he did not respond. The announcement was made in the name of the core team members, including emeritus member Harald Welte, who is well known for bringing a series of successful GPL enforcement lawsuits in Germany. A few weeks earlier, the Netfilter core team published a statement officially endorsing the Principles of Community-Oriented GPL Enforcement, which were released by the Software Freedom Conservancy and the FSF in 2015. The core team stated that "license enforcement is a necessary tool to ensure all parties adhere to the same set of fair rules as set forth by the license," but then, presumably alluding to McHardy, declared that "any enforcement action should always be focused on compliance, never prioritize financial gain, never settle for less than compliance and consider legal action in court only as a last resort." In the July 18th announcement of McHardy's suspension, the core team said that McHardy "continues to be welcome in the project as soon as he is able to address the allegations and/or co-sign the [Conservancy/FSF Principles] in terms of any future enforcement activities." The next day, Karen Sandler and Bradley Kuhn of the Software Freedom Conservancy published a blog post addressing the subject of McHardy. They revealed that Conservancy had engaged in largely unsuccessful attempted communications with McHardy for two years. Conservancy encouraged McHardy to co-draft the Principles with them and later invited him to endorse the Principles after they were published, but received no response from him. Sandler and Kuhn denounced McHardy for apparently refusing to endorse the Principles and failing to publicly justify his conduct of GPL enforcement. 3. Hellwig lawsuit dismissed In 2015 Linux kernel developer Christoph Hellwig brought a copyright infringement suit against VMware in a German district court, alleging violation of the GPL in VMware's ESXi product. Hellwig's legal expenses were funded by the Software Freedom Conservancy. The Hellwig lawsuit attracted significant attention because it is apparently the first litigated GPL compliance case that centers on the scope of the GPL's copyleft requirement, sometimes thought of as the "derivative work" issue. In July 2016, as Scott Peterson has reported, the court dismissed the case, concluding that Hellwig had failed to identify in the VMware product the specific lines of code in which he owned copyright. The court discussed the GPL issue, but it did not address the merits. The ruling has no precedential significance for other cases. In a brief statement, Hellwig announced that he would appeal the ruling. 4. U.S. government announces Federal Source Code Policy In August the U.S. government's Office of Management and Budget announced the Federal Source Code Policy. The policy is aimed at reducing the problem of duplicative acquisition of substantially similar code by agencies and ensuring that new custom-developed federal source code be made broadly available for reuse across the federal government. Mark Bohannon has written an article on the policy. The Federal Source Code Policy establishes a three-year pilot program that requires agencies (with some exclusions) to release at least 20% of new custom-developed software as open source each year. The policy recognizes open source as a means of enabling continual improvement resulting from improvements to the software by the broader community. The policy also announced the launch of code.gov, a "discoverability portal" for custom-developed code, including code released as open source under the policy. The Federal Source Code Policy is notable for placing emphasis on adhering to proper standards for open development as well as open source licensing. Agencies releasing open source code are directed to do so in a manner that encourages engagement with existing communities, fosters growth of new communities, and facilitates contribution both by the community to the federal code and by federal employees and contractors to upstream projects. Agencies must also ensure that their open source repositories include enough information to enable reuse and participation by third parties, including details on licensing. 5. Moglen steps down as FSF general counsel The Free Software Foundation announced in October 2016 that Eben Moglen had "stepped down" as general counsel to the FSF. Moglen, who is president of the Software Freedom Law Center and a law professor at Columbia, has been one of the most influential lawyers in free software. His career in free software has been closely associated in the public mind with the FSF, for which he provided pro bono legal representation for 23 years. I expect both Moglen and the FSF to remain as engaged as ever in matters of free software legal policy, but likely with more instances of public disagreement or conflicting opinions. 6. Debian and Ubuntu ship ZFS In the mid-2000s Sun Microsystems released its ZFS filesystem as part of OpenSolaris, licensed under the weak copyleft CDDL. Efforts to port ZFS to Linux were inhibited for many years by legal concerns, including concerns about license conflicts between GPLv2 and CDDL. In recent years the "ZFS on Linux" project has encouraged Linux distributions to package its ZFS kernel module. Although packaging of ZFS in Debian was held up for some time by licensing concerns, in 2015 Debian Project Leader Lucas Nussbaum revealed that Debian had received legal advice from the Software Freedom Law Center concerning inclusion of ZFS in Debian, which he said "should unblock the situation ... and enable us to ship [ZFS] in Debian soon." In January 2016, Nussbaum's successor, Neil McGovern, said that ZFS would be included in Debian as a DKMS package in source code form only, and would be segregated in the "contrib" archive, which contains packages that are not considered to be official Debian. Ubuntu had included a source-only DKMS ZFS package for some time before Debian began doing so. In a blog post in February, Canonical's Dustin Kirkland announced that Ubuntu would begin shipping a binary ZFS kernel module. Following a flurry of debate over the GPL/CDDL issue, Kirkland said in another blog post that Canonical had discussed the legal issues with Eben Moglen (president of SFLC) and had concluded that distribution of the binary kernel module would be compliant with both GPLv2 and CDDL. Kirkland stressed that the ZFS module was "self contained" and was not a derivative work of the kernel, and the kernel was not a derivative work of ZFS. Kirkland also argued that "[e]quivalent exceptions have existed for many years, for various other stand-alone, self-contained, non-GPL kernel modules." Shortly after Kirkland's second blog post, the Software Freedom Conservancy and SFLC published conflicting analyses of the legality of Canonical's distribution. (For those who don't know: SFLC and Conservancy are independent organizations.) They agreed, however, on two basic points: (1) Debian's distribution of a source-only module in contrib was license compliant, and (2) loadable kernel modules generally fall within the scope of the GPL copyleft on the kernel. Conservancy claimed to be speaking on its own behalf as a Linux kernel copyright assignee as well as on behalf of kernel copyright holders participating in its GPL Compliance Project for Linux Developers. In Conservancy's view, Canonical's distribution of the binary kernel module violates GPLv2 and thus infringes copyright on the kernel. Conservancy believes that derivative works involving GPL license incompatibilities with other free software licenses should be subjected to the same legal analysis as GPL/proprietary combinations. According to SFLC, Canonical's binary ZFS module must be regarded as licensed under GPLv2, since CDDL allows binaries to be under any license and any other interpretation would assume that Canonical was noncompliant with the GPL. Therefore, distribution of the ZFS binary module itself would not violate GPLv2; however, Canonical's otherwise compliant distribution of corresponding source code for the ZFS kernel module and the Ubuntu kernel would "literally" violate GPLv2, because Canonical would be providing the ZFS filesystem source code under CDDL. There are good reasons for a community of copyright holders of a GPL project not to object to this literal GPLv2 violation, because the conduct falls within the spirit or the "equity" of the license. In SFLC's view, given the tension between the literal and equitable interpretations of GPLv2, "the consensus of the kernel copyright holders' intention … determines which mode of interpretation is to be employed." Here, there was no conclusive or convincing evidence of what type of interpretation the kernel copyright holders intend. SFLC argued that for as long as the kernel copyright holders choose not to object to Canonical's distribution, it should be assumed that the consensus of the kernel licensors is to support the equitable interpretation. SFLC also pointed out that Canonical's potential liability exposure was negligible. Neil McGovern discussed his experience of the ZFS topic as Debian Project Leader in a talk at DebConf. Other noteworthy statements on the ZFS issue were made by Richard Stallman and by Linux kernel developer James Bottomley. Little has been said about the issue in recent months. 7. Apache Software Foundation bans JSON license For some of us involved in open source legal matters, Douglas Crockford's JSON license keeps turning up like a bad penny. The JSON license famously modifies the MIT license by adding a sentence before the warranty disclaimer: "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil." It is not clear whether Crockford intended the license purely as a joke, or as an oblique political statement, or both. Many who care about having a principled basis for classifying licenses as free, or open source, see the "Good, not Evil" clause as conflicting with basic definitional norms that disallow field of use restrictions and discrimination based on field of endeavor. Some have argued that the clause is not enforceable and thus should not be taken seriously; however, the FSF, which classifies the JSON license as non-free, argues that it cannot be presumed that the restriction is unenforceable. Another objection to the license is that "Good" and "Evil" are undefined and thus the scope of conduct that is allowed and prohibited is highly uncertain. The reason the JSON license is not a matter of complete obscurity is that Crockford has applied it to software that happens to have been widely adopted, including the tools JSLint and JSMin and the JSON Java library ("JSON-java"). Over the years Crockford has refused many requests from developers to change the license, although he has boasted of having granted special permission to IBM and "its customers, partners, and minions, to use JSLint for evil." For many years the Apache Software Foundation, known for strict rules on licensing under which, for example, the GPL and LGPL are relegated to a forbidden "Category X," treated JSON-java as though it were in its most favored "Category A" (which contains noncopyleft licenses, such as the Apache License 2.0 itself). Today several ASF projects have dependencies under the JSON license. In October 2016, in a posting to the ASF's legal-discuss mailing list, Ted Dunning called on the ASF to revisit its decision, noting that the JSON license was "substantially hindering downstream adoption." After discussion, Jim Jagielski, VP of Legal Affairs for the ASF, declared that "the license is NOT CatA and is NOT approved," placing the JSON license in Category X. Jagielski later clarified that no new use of the JSON license by an ASF project would be allowed, but some projects already using code under the license would have a grace period of several months to transition to a replacement. The issue was covered in a November 2016 LWN.net article. Because so many ASF projects have been widely adopted, the JSON license prohibition seems likely to have a significant community impact in encouraging use of open source alternatives to JSON-licensed software.

I'm wondering what the community's take is on BSL [1] While not new (2013) I think there is a worthwhile pending debate on post-modern licensing given the increased attention put in the last year or so on funding/business models for open source as covered by Eghbal, Okoli/Nguyen and others. It's probably accepted without proof that well-established open source licenses will persist in the next decade as they have survived the cycle, yet might be under additional stress in the upcoming stage.

That’s one of the reasons WhatsApp has chosen not to enforce its $1 per year charge for users in the country. This is soon set to change though as Google Play Store is prepping direct carrier billing for Vodafone and Airtel subscribers. Postpaid Idea Cellular users in India can already download paid apps through Google Play Store and have it charged to their monthly mobile bills. This facility has been available on these shores for some time. It will soon be reaching Airtel and Vodafone too, as mentioned above. So what’s in it for the telecom operator offering such a service in partnership with Google? A small convenience charge is applicable for every download. Idea struck a similar deal with Microsoft in order to enable Windows Phone users to download apps and pay for them later along with their mobile bill. Another way to access paid applications on the Android platform is by buying a Google Play Gift Card (Rs 750, Rs 1000 and Rs 1500 denominations purchasable) online or through a physical outlet. Then there’s always Internet banking as a third option. Android Police reports that some postpaid customers with Airtel and Vodafone SIM cards have been receiving popups for direct carrier billing in the payment method options within Google Play Store. The authorization SMS is apparently not working though.

It appears that someone at Qualcomm hit the "publish" button a bit early today and posted a blog post that tipped the Asus ZenFone AR, the first Tango-enabled smartphone to be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor. As GSM Arena notes, the post is dated Jan. 4. It has since been removed, though a cached version is still live, but it detailed a smartphone that taps into Google's Tango AR and Daydream VR platforms. According to the blog post, Zenfone AR owners can snap the device into a Google Daydream View VR headset and "explore new worlds with apps like Google Street View and Fantastic Beasts, dive into your personal VR cinema with YouTube, Netflix, Hulu and HBO, and get your game on with Gunjack 2, LEGO BrickHeadz, Need for Speed and dozens other titles." Look for a "high-resolution display, ultra-smooth graphics, and high-fidelity sensors for precise head tracking." This afternoon, reliable leaker Evan Blass tweeted photos of what he says are the Zenfone AR. ASUS ZenFone AR (2nd Google Tango phone) pic.twitter.com/ctKQ9IKfeC — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 2, 2017 His tweet notes that this is the second Google Tango phone, the first being the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro (pictured above). We found that it serves as more of a showcase for Google Tango than a case for augmented reality, but the future looks promising, and the phone is solid in its own right. The Phab 2 Pro, though, sports the modest Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 processor, while the Zenfone AR reportedly runs the newer 821. Qualcomm revealed the Snapdragon 821 in July, and touted 10 percent better performance than the 820. Shortly thereafter, Asus announced that its ZenFone 3 Deluxe would be the first smartphone to run Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821, though it was only available to customers in Asia who selected the top-of-the-line model. "Snapdragon 821 processors are designed to bring a few significant advantages to Tango and the ZenFone AR," according to Qualcomm's blog post. Related A Night at the Museum With Project Tango A Night at the Museum With Project Tango "The Qualcomm Adreno 530 GPU in Snapdragon 821 brings a 40 percent improvement in graphics performance at 40 percent less power than the Snapdragon 810," the blog post said. "So you can get more hours of augmented reality along with great graphics on the ZenFone AR. Qualcomm also talked up "how well 3D graphic overlays match up with actual physical surroundings." Google's Daydream VR platform, meanwhile, arrived earlier this year, and is also available on the Pixel and Moto Z lineup of smartphones.

By: Express Web Desk | New Delhi | Updated: January 3, 2017 8:21 am Google’s tribute to Savitribai Phule on her 186th birth anniversary. (Source: Google doodle) Commemorating the 186th birth anniversary of social reformer and poet Savitribai Phule, Google has dedicated a special doodle on the day.  At a time when women were subjected to oppression and their grievances rarely identified, Savitribai, along with her husband Jyotirao Phule, stood up for the rights of women and fought against the injustice faced by them. Watch What Else Is Making News Savitribai Phule was born to a family of wealthy farmers on January 3, 1831 in Naigaon, Maharashtra. She was married off at the young age of nine, but was determined to study and was one of the very few indigenous literate women in her era. She went on to play a crucial role in the social reform movement in Maharashtra and along with her husband Jyotirao started the first girls school in 1848 in Pune. She was also known for her efforts in abolishing discrimination and stood up against unfair treatment of people based on caste and gender. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Best of Express Meghalaya sex scam: Guest-house owned by Home Minister’s family under probe EntertainmentOk Jaanu box office collection day 3: Aditya Roy Kapur, Shraddha Kapoor film struggles to hold ground EntertainmentxXx Return of Xander Cage box office collection day 2: Deepika Padukone-Vin Diesel film expected to earn well EntertainmentSalman Khan shares nostalgic picture from sets of Karan Arjun, wishes SRK-Hrithik for Raees-Kaabil EntertainmentKoffee With Karan: Kareena Kapoor Khan, Sonam Kapoor turn Karan Johar's show into a mini kitty party Must Read SportsKohli, Kedar hit magical tons to script sensational win SportsThis win is going to take a while to sink in, says Kohli SportsVirat Kohli leaves Twitterati awe-struck after century TechnologyNokia could be developing a foldable smartphone, hints patent TechnologyLenovo sends out press invite for MWC 2017, may debut Moto G5 Plus TechnologyFormer Android chief Andy Rubin to release a high-end, AI-focused smartphone  Sonam Kapoor, Frieda Pinto, Pooja Hegde: Best and worst dressed Bollywood divas at Filmfare Awards 2017 Jan 16: Latest News Centre issues draft requirements under digital village initiative Startup India: 2016 not a good year as new startups decline by 67% China finally agrees to import buffalo meat from India Kathputli Colony: Life at the transit camp C N Rao at Jamia Hamdard Convocation: ‘To excel in science, we need hard work, funds for varsities’                           The Express Group The Indian Express The Financial Express Loksatta Jansatta inUth Ramnath Goenka Awards Privacy Policy Advertise with Us Contact Us Subscribe Please reload and try again !!!

Today, the battle for the touchscreen on the dashboard of your next new car may have swung dramatically in Google’s favor thanks to a new partnership between Alphabet and Fiat Chrysler. In a pre-CES press release, Fiat Chrysler announced that its Uconnect in-vehicle infotainment system will now be integrated with Android.  Don't Miss: Celebrity sues Tesla, claims Model X drove itself through a wall and into his house Most new vehicles that come with some form of a touchscreen interface utilize whatever operating system the manufacturer managed to cobble together. They’re often slow, clunky, and not terribly attractive. Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto have thus far existed on the fringe, allowing owners of supported vehicles to use the platforms if they want, but as a secondary option behind the default built-in software. Now, Fiat Chrysler is using Android 7.0 to support its Uconnect software, taking over the job of designing and maintaining its own custom Android skin, and fully integrating Andriod’s app support and other features on a core level. A working concept of the Android/Uconnect marriage will be on display at CES 2017. It’s a smart move for Google, who is a seasoned veteran when it comes to handing over the keys to its mobile platform to manufacturers. Apple, on the other hand, keeps things much more locked-down, and it’s hard to imagine Cook and company giving anyone — especially an automotive manufacturer — the freedom to tweak iOS in a similar way. It’s interesting to note that many brands under the Fiat Chrysler umbrella are on Apple’s list of CarPlay proponents, including Chrysler, Fiat, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, and Alfa Romeo. It’s unclear if any vehicle that would utilize the Android-flavored Uconnect software would also support CarPlay, but that’s probably a long shot.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google recently patched camera flaw in Pixel which would allow tracking By John Hoff - January 2, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Lately, Google has seemed very serious about the privacy and security in Android. This is evident in the huge jump in security features made in Marshmallow from Lollipop. Since late 2015 as well, the mothership has been providing monthly security updates to Android to make sure the platform keeps up with security threats. Very recently, Google recently patched a camera-related security opening in the Pixel and Pixel XL phones that would have allowed hackers to do tracking. The flaw had to do with the front-facing camera’s (made by HTC) serial number being accessible to third party apps. This is an obvious security flaw that could point people to specific devices. Google says that “Camera sensor’s serial number, stored in system property htc.camera.sensor.front_SN, appears to change between different devices and could thus facilitate tracking.” A couple of days ago, Google issued an internal fix, restricting access to said information. Google’s commit says, “This commit restricts access to this system property to cameraserver and dumpstate and shell SELinux domains. Test: Camera works, serial number property still available via ADB, but not readable by apps.” The internal update now stops apps from accessing the front-facing camera’s serial number information. Testing the patch demonstrates that the camera still works as normal, with the said information now hidden from apps.

Qualcomm has prematurely revealed the Asus ZenFone AR, which boats the same room-mapping augmented reality Tango technology as the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, which went on sale in the autumn. As announced by a now-pulled Qualcomm blog post, the ZenFone AR will sport a Snapdragon 821 processor, just like the one housed in the Google Pixel and OnePlus 3T. Related: What is Google Tango? Most of the specs are yet to be confirmed, but it will be Google Daydream-ready according to the blog post, which also suggested compatibility with the Daydream View headset. Photos of the front and rear of the device were also posted by the notorious @evleaks on Monday. We’re likely to learn all of the details at ASUS’ CES press conference, which takes place on Wednesday. Team Trusted will be on hand to bring you all of the news.

Asus ZenFone AR is set to be the second Tango supported handset, following the Lenovo PHAB2 Pro announced in June 2016. Tango is Google's platform that allows developers to use augmented reality, 3D mapping, and more, to add another virtual layer onto the smartphone's camera. Qualcomm's press release said the ZenFone AR will be both Tango-enabled and Daydream VR-ready, and it will be powered by the Snapdragon 821 processor. Other specifications weren't shared. See also: CES 2017: Announcements to expect from this year's show Qualcomm noted support for Google's VR apps including Street View, YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, HBO, and more. Qualcomm added future Snapdragon 800 series and 600 series chipsets will support Tango. Availability and pricing details weren't made available. Given that CES 2017 is right around the corner, the January 4 date shown in the press image is the likely day for Asus to make things official (not to mention it has a press event that day, too).
