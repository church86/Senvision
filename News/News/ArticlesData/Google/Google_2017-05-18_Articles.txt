By: Samden Sherpa Updated: Friday, May 19, 2017, 11:43 [IST] Google officially announced its new Android version codenamed Android O at its I/O 2017 developer conference. The company even talked about its features and functionality which we have reported earlier. And besides Android O, the search giant even had few more announcements for Android fans. Those being the launch of Android GO, and support for Kotin which will be a different programming language for Android developers. Google will be working with JetBrains (Kotlin was written by the JetBrains) to provide this tool that will help developers build great apps. SEE ALSO: Google I/O 2017: Android O and Android GO announced, interesting features revealed However, coming back to Android O, while the launch of this new OS is set for later this year, the company is now releasing the updated version of the Android O Developer Preview. As of the now the Preview is available for download. So if you want to experience the new Android O and can't wait for the stable update then you can sign-up or register yourself to the Android O Beta Program. By doing so you will be able to get the update and load the new Andriod system in your device. The updates you receive will all be pre-release versions. At the same time, the Android Beta Program will also give you an opportunity to provide feedback about the new OS. Alternatively, if you have already signed up and have installed the first Developer Preview then you should automatically get the OTA update to pre-release versions of the MRs as they become available. As for the devices that will be supporting Android O OTA are as follows: Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Nexus Player, Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C. SEE ALSO: Google I/O: Standalone VR headsets from Lenovo & HTC Vive, Tango phone from Asus and more announcement It is also worth mentioning that since the updates are pre-release versions it may contain errors and defects that can affect the normal functioning of your device. But that is the whole point of the Beta test program. So that all these errors are fixed. In case you install the update, and you want to go back to the public version of Android then you have an option to opt-out of the program at any time. But you should also be aware that if you opt out when your device is running a beta version of Android, all user data on the device will be lost. So it better not to have any valuable data stored on the phone. There is one more thing before we conclude, Google has also released the factory images and OTA files for Android O Developer Preview 2, so you can go ahead and download them here.

Around 50 percent of the apps are slammed due to their unstable nature, forcing them to shut down prematurely, said the Google Play team at the company’s annual I/O developer conference. Apps utilising an unnecessary amount of a phone’s CPU while in idle mode and draining the battery are first in line to be scrapped. Limits will also be imposed on the amount of time an app can request location data, etc. Even though Google recorded 82 billion app installations in the past year, its plan to enhance Play Store app ratings at the bottom 25 percent will see many egregious apps die. Apps causing a screen freeze, specifically for more than five seconds, and apps that show lag – apps that render frames at less than 60 fps for 50 percent of the time, will be put on Google’s hit list. Google plans to follow up with tips from users to help app makers understand the problems to turn the apps around. A metrics dashboard for developers will also be kept in play to notify developers when it is time to release an update and or flush out reasons as to why users have been uninstalling the app in such large numbers.

The company is also the leader in the browser market, has one of the best email clients, and a great online storage service. However, there is only one other area beside search where Google truly dominates the whole field; Maps. Google Maps is the simply the best mapping service available today. This unrivaled excellence hasn’t come easily for Google and, despite running a near-monopoly, the company still strives to keep improving Google Maps as much as possible and sets the standards for innovation in the field. One thing that has always intrigued me is how does Google really find out all the addresses on its Map app? How does it learn the street names? Sure, the images could come from a satellite but how can it really determine the addresses unless somebody filled them out? A lot of people do contribute to Google Maps by filling out general information but there is no way they can account for all the information available on it. City planners around the world don’t really follow a particular addressing scheme either and hiring people to go around and note down the addresses simply isn’t practical. Although Google does employ some people (contractors) for this job, that isn’t how the most of the work is done. Addresses are ever-changing and new addresses are added around the world every day. So what does Google do? It uses its prowess in deep learning and its immense database of imagery collected through Street View to add new addresses in Google Maps as well as update the old ones. Using Deep Learning and Street View Imagery to Learn Street Names Google has a huge collection of images taken for their Street View program through cars, bikes, trikes, backpack-carrying dudes and what not. Now, they want to utilize all this information and put it to use. For example, they want to find the images of street signs and businesses, extract the text, and then assign those to the respective streets or businesses. A piece of cake, right? All you have to do is look at an image of a street sign and assign it to the location it was taken at. The problem? Google has over 80 billion images. That’s a lot and analyzing all that data is humanly impossible. So Google decided to use deep learning to use that to go through the images, find the relevant images, extract the text, and automatically assign it. What is Deep Learning? Deep Learning is a type of machine learning that, in some ways, tries to mimic the workings of a human brain. Deep learning algorithms allow a computer to recognize objects or data patterns. Basically, they try to make sense from data on their own and without any human intervention. They are also trying to constantly improve themselves based on previous results. Google has been one of the leading contributors to the field of deep learning. It even released some consumer-focused tools like “Quick, Draw” and “Autodraw” to give a glimpse of the wonders that can be possible with deep learning. Using Deep Learning to extract text Text recognition has always been a challenging computer vision and machine learning problem. Computer algorithms are just not good enough when it comes to reading text from images, especially when the images aren’t always ideal. Some may be tilted or have a different viewpoint, some may be blurry or distorted, while some may be simply too dark. There are also a lot of other problems that arise due to ground truth errors — writing “Avenue” as “Av” on the street-name board, etc. The company has been working on a number of models to solve this problem. In 2014, they unveiled a new method for reading street numbers on the Street View House Numbers. “Today, over one-third of addresses globally have had their location improved thanks to this system” Since then, they have been working on developing a system that could accurately read street names. Just last month, they published a paper called “Attention-based Extraction of Structured Information from Street View Imagery” on their latest model. How does it work? The paper details how their network model uses Convolutional Neural Nets and Recurrent Neural Nets and a novel attention mechanism to achieve an accuracy of 84.2% on the challenging French Street Name Signs (FSNS) dataset, a large and challenging training dataset of more than 1 million street names. Their new model, publicly available now, handily beat the previous state-of-the-art model, Smith’16, which achieved an accuracy of 72.46%. It is also said to be much simpler and more general than the previous approach and can be used to extract other types of information out of Street View images as well, like business names from store fronts. “Surprisingly, we find that deeper is not always better (in terms of accuracy, as well as speed). Our resulting model is simple, accurate and fast, allowing it to be used at scale on a variety of challenging real-world text extraction problems,” it reads. Google has made some immense strides in artificial intelligence and machine learning recently, and while tools that could fill in the color in your doodles may sound gimmicky, the trickle-down effects of these advancements can be felt in almost every one of their products. Be it Google search’s amazing knowledge graph, or the incredibly contextual Google Assistant, or be it the ability to know every street name in your neighborhood — the company is so good at some things, it’s hard to imagine a life without it.

But since the long-available Android One platform aims to accomplish similar — albeit not identical — goals, we thought we’d ask Google exactly where Go sits in the new lineup. Not only did Google clarify the difference between them, it also (perhaps mistakingly) touched on the long-rumored launch of Android One for the US… Everyone can use an Echo Dot: Just $50! We already knew based on yesterday’s announcement that Android Go is distinctly different from Android One. Google isn’t focusing on restricting the hardware of partners to fit Android with Go. Rather, Google wants to focus on building a flavor of Android that can run on the “lowest common denominator” of Android devices. Basically, rather than force partners to use specific hardware and push the latest letter version of Android, Google wants Android Go as a software platform to meet hardware makers where they are — and thereby accomplish a similar endgame. Google’s lead for the Android One project is Arpit Midha, who was a Product Manager on Project Loon at Google [X]. As he said during the session this evening, Android One was Google putting a lot of restrictions on its partners, but that resulted in Android One not being “able to reach enough users.” So, when we launched Android One, the focus was on delivering a core Google experience … which was also very secure. So we focused on security updates. We focused on OS letter updates and to do so we had to put a lot of restrictions on our partners in terms of what hardware components and chips they could use. That created a friction in the market that the partners were not happy with. And eventually we were not able to reach enough users. He went on: In Go, as you see, the focus is not to restrict hardware at all. The focus is completely to make the apps and the OS work on the lowest common dominator. So, therefore the ecosystem adoption will be higher and we still will try to get the best parts of Android One (which is security updates) to continue to go on on this one. So Google’s bet with Android Go is that they’ll forgo the “friction” that happened with its partners and get a lot better adoption than Android One. And it seems that Go is also going to be aimed at lower-tier devices going forward than Android One. I asked Arpit if Android Go was going to be effectively replacing Android One, but instead of turning down that suggestion, he instead seemed to imply that Android One will instead move to focus on “middle of the market” devices. “The new Android One that we saw launch in the US is targeting somewhere the middle of the market,” Arpit said. This part is especially interesting considering Android One has not launched in the US. And yet, he stated this as if it’s commonly-known fact. Android One’s US launch has been rumored by typically-reliable sources to be in the works, however, with one report earlier this year saying that it was scheduled to launch sometime in the middle of 2017. It could be, perhaps, that Arpit misspoke. Or maybe — just maybe — this ex-Google[X] lead could actually know something we don’t and accidentally let it slip. We published some whispers we heard form a source earlier this year regarding the Android One US launch. In that report, we said that Project Fi support is coming to “Android One” phones for the US, mentioned a couple of launch candidate phones, and also heard that these phones could have price points that are more toward the middle-of-the-market in terms of their price tags and specs. That would line up well with Arpit’s suggestion that “as we saw” (which we didn’t) Android One’s US launch is targeted at the “middle of the market.” Amir over at The Information said that the phone Google launches on Android One at some point would be $200-$300. Everything is up in the air at this point, and for all we know this is something that will never materialize. We reached out to Google about it, and their official word on the matter is that Android One has not launched and is not available in the US. We already knew that, of course, but we’re hoping to hear back soon on exactly what Arpit might have meant with this statement.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see.

Many apps and stores already accept Android Pay, and Google is growing its footprint, it said. Android Pay is now available in 10 markets, with more coming soon – including Brazil, Canada, Russia, Spain, and Taiwan. Google is also working with Visa and Mastercard to enable a streamlined mobile checkout experience for PayPal users. Google’s Payment API makes it possible to pay in app or online with any verified credit or debit card saved to a Google Account, via products like Google Play, Chrome, and YouTube. Android users with a debit card linked to their Google account will also be able to pay via the Google Assistant. “On your Google Home or Android device, it’s as simple as saying: Ok Google, send $10 to Jane for pizza,” said Google.

It’s been roughly a year since Google announced that support for Android apps would be coming to Chrome OS. Unfortunately, the rollout has taken place at a snail’s pace as there are currently only six devices that support Android apps on the stable version of the operating system. As it stands today, Android apps on Chrome OS are still technically in beta. As Kan Liu, senior director of product management for Chrome OS, tells The Verge, Android apps are around “80 percent” ready for most users. That last 20 percent, however, won’t be completed as quickly as one might think, especially with Liu conceding that “the first 80 percent is 20 percent of the work [and] the last 20 percent is 80 percent of the work.” Liu didn’t give a definitive date as to when the beta status would be pulled but he did reveal something that’s perhaps even more interesting. Because Chrome OS launches new builds far more frequently than the dessert (mobile) version of Android (every six weeks), Liu said that some Android features will arrive on Chrome OS before they hit phones. That’s great news for Chrome OS users as major Android releases are notoriously slow at rolling out onto mobile devices. The latest version of Android (Nougat), for example, was released on August 22, 2016, yet is only installed on 7.1 percent of mobile devices.

The list of supported devices includes the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. The next major version of Android has several under the hood improvements like limiting resource consumption by apps running in the background, which should result in improved battery life, as well as improving boot up times, general performance and security. But there are also several new user facing features and changes worthy of mention. Here are some of these new features you'll see in Android O: Picture in picture With Android O you’ll be able to keep a video running in a small window while you’re doing other stuff on your phone. For now only YouTube Red subscribers and users of the Google Duo video-chatting app have access to this functionality, but third party developers will likely jump on board soon. Notification dots You’ll now see tiny badges placed on app icons to inform you when those apps have new notifications. They essentially work much the same way as Badge Icons on iOS except they’re not numbered, and Google automatically matches the color of dots to the app icon. The notification tray is still there, Google is just offering another way of accessing app notifications — instead of pulling down the notification shade to view a particular alert, you can now view it by pressing and holding on the icon of an app that has a notification dot so you can act on it or swipe it away. Autofill Autofill now extends into apps using context like user names so you don't have to manually enter frequently used info all time. If you keep your passwords stored in Chrome you’ll now be able to autofill those details in apps too rather than only when using the browser. Smart text selection Google is constantly getting smarter about context and now whenever you select part of an address, Google will be able to automatically select all the relevant parts so you don’t have to fiddle around with those tiny handles. Android can recognize phone numbers, addresses, and the names of businesses, and will offer quick actions like launching the dialer, Google Maps or Gmail depending on what’s selected. Blob emojis are gone Google has done a full redesign of their admittedly ugly emoji set with something that looks more consistent with what other platforms offer instead of those confusing blobs. And more Android O will offer a cleaner settings app that groups similar options together, more granular control over notifications, including the ability to “snooze” notifications for later and the ability to group different apps into different Notification Channels, among several other small changes. You can sign up for the Android O beta at android.com/beta.

Soon , they will supersede them, the assistant will become the primary interface Subscribe to our newsletter. Leonid Bershidsky Digital assistant will do all the work for the user. If you want to post to Facebook, for example, you won’t need to open the app — the assistant will give you a window to do it. Photo: Reuters For years, mobile phone owners have had access to just one digital assistant -— Siri on an iPhone, Google Now/Google Assistant on an Android device, Cortana on a Windows one. Now that’s changing as multiple assistants proliferate to multiple phones. It sounds like an epidemic case of multiple personality disorder but it’s actually a step toward a future in which the artificially intelligent entities will take over our gadgets and make them more powerful and easier to use. Google Assistant, the unimaginatively named software that pops up on Android phones when you say “OK Google,” is now available for iPhones. You can’t ask it to take a selfie or perform some other tasks — Apple keeps that functionality for its own Siri — but you are free to enjoy its superior speech-recognition technology. With some technical skill, you can also run Google Assistant on Windows systems alongside the native digital assistant, Cortana (which, in turn, has been available on Android and iOS for a while). Since millions of people are using Alexa, the helpful voice inside the Echo speaker, smartphone maker HTC’s new flagship phone, the U11, responds to both “OK Google” and “Alexa!” Samsung’s Galaxy S8, for its part, includes both Google Assistant and the Korean company’s own Bixby. In other words, the digital assistants are getting untethered from makers and even operating systems. Soon, they will supersede them: The assistant becomes the primary interface, and the user doesn’t really care about what’s under the hood unless he or she is a determined geek. But that shift is predicated on improvements to voice interaction technology that have eluded developers so far. Whatever the makers of these systems claim about their voice recognition technology, it’s highly imperfect — there are lots of funny examples on Reddit’s r/SiriFail. So Google is adding keyboard input support to Assistant, and camera support will also come soon, the company announced at its developer conference (now under way). That means we’ll be able to train the phone’s camera on a flower or a building, and it’ll tell us what it is, or translate text from a foreign language without a special app. The idea is that the digital assistant will do all the work for the user. If you want to post to Facebook, for example, you won’t need to open the app — the assistant will give you a window to do it; if you’re trying to figure out if the restaurant in front of you is worth entering, you won’t need to google it or bring up the Yelp app, just train the camera on the sign and the assistant will give you all the relevant information. The benefits for the user are obvious. Eventually, it may become unnecessary to install apps on a phone — the assistant will just pull the necessary data from various services in the cloud. Digital assistant developers, for their part, can point users toward their own services, something vitally important for Google and Amazon but also helpful for Microsoft and Apple. Sure, that will probably prompt antitrust complaints, but regulators are taking years to consider such cases even with more easy-to-understand technology. In 2010, the European Commission started its investigation of how Google allegedly prioritizes its own shopping comparison service in search results; the case is still dragging on. By the time it’s over, new technology will be in place that may take watchdogs another decade to parse, and since the assistants are powered by artificial intelligence, developers will have a new defence: These algorithms have a life of their own, and it won’t always be possible to completely control their choices. Now, people hardly ever use the digital assistants on desktop and laptop computers, very often on home speakers and not that frequently on phones. Talking to a gadget when you’re not driving a car remains a turn-off for many people (and for me, definitely). Only 18% of smartphone users call up the assistants daily. The speakers, however, will be niche products for a long time. Not everyone can think of a use for them. Phones, however, are ubiquitous — and suddenly the whole market is up for grabs for the company that develops the perfect digital assistant and makes it the interface of choice. That’s why Samsung, for example, believes it can get in the game — and why Amazon is already in it. The mission is far from trivial. Artificial intelligence needs training to get better, and that means more interactions with humans. Companies need to entice customers to use highly imperfect products. That takes a lot of hype and some quick improvement, otherwise disappointed phone users will drift away. Google and Amazon appear to be the most determined developers at this point, but there’s still time (not that much) for Apple and Microsoft to catch up. In the end, getting the digital assistants to take over our gadgets is a collaborative effort between developers, users and machine-learning algorithms. It’s not quite clear yet if a complete takeover is even possible; that depends on whether the algorithms ever get as good at giving us what we want as we are at getting it manually (an increasingly relative term). But given the enormous resources being invested into this play, it’s likely to bring about change in the way we use our communication devices even if it doesn’t succeed 100%.

Last year Google ran through a range of different categories from Best Game to Going Global, and this year Google will be listing off the winners for all new categories along with returning categories like those listed above in addition to Best App, Best Families App, and others. Developers work hard all year to bring users the most intuitive, most fun, and most innovative apps and games and Google is giving a little bit back by shining the spotlight on those that stood out the most. Standout Indie Indie games hold a special place in the hearts of many gamers, and not just because some of the content that comes out of indie studios is breathtaking, but also because they tend to showcase what can really be done with even a small team of dedicated individuals. The winner for this year’s Standout Indie app is actually a game called Mushroom 11, a recently released puzzle title that features some pretty awesome visuals and intensely imaginative landscapes. The runners up include Causality, Kingdom: New Lands, Reigns, and Mars: Mars. Google play Standout Startup As the name of this category suggests the apps in this particular category are all coming out of startups, which not unlike Indie studios can have smaller teams, though not always. Starting a business cane be an especially challenging task and taking that risk to launch a startup deserves some recognition in itself, but even more so when you use that startup to create an app that seeks to offer something unique and engaging. The winner of Standout Startup is Hooked, an app which offers users a collection of thrilling “edge-of-your-seat” stories that are all told through the medium of chat. It’s a fresh idea that actually caught on and has grown to include a massive number of users. The runners up for this category are Discord, Simple Habit, CastBox, and Digit. Google play Best Android Wear Experience Android Wear has grown into a bustling platform for wearables especially since the launch of Android Wear 2.0 which brought a handful of nice improvements. That said the platform is still growing and has plenty of room to grow too, but there are still some awesome apps which are already available for the platform that are getting daily use. The winner for Best Android Wear Experience is Runtastic Running & Fitness, which lets users do anything from track their runs to their calories burned, their distance and pace, and even get audio feedback from a voice coach to keep you motivated. The Runners up for this category are Lifesum, Bring!, and Foursquare. Google play Best TV Experience As Android TV continues to evolve and add new and exciting features, so to does the library of Android TV native applications that offer awesome content for those who have a compatible device that runs the platform. The winner for Best TV Experience is Redbull TV. While a big portion of it will be filled with videos of action-related sports, there’s also coverage of events, music, and sports too, and what better way to watch this exciting content than on the big screen where pictures are vibrant and well… large. The runners up for this category are Netflix, Haystack TV, AbemaTV, and KKBOX. Google play Best VR Experience While VR has been around for more than just the past six months to a year, Google’s first VR headset (not counting Cardboard) didn’t release until the Fall of 2016. Since then there have been a number of apps and games that have been pushed out for Daydream and many of them are quite good, pulling the user into their worlds and immersing them in some of the most captivating universes out there. The winner of Best VR Experience is Virtual Virtual Reality, a game which tasks the player with trying to escape the future of an A.I.-driven world where everything is automated and humans are sort of obsolete when it comes to jobs. It lets you put on a VR headset in virtual reality, so you’re essentially diving into VR while already in VR, and you can do all sorts of crazy things. The runners up for this category are, The Arcslinger, Gunjack 2: End Of Shift, Mekorama VR, and The Turning Forest. Google play Best AR Experience Much like virtual reality, augmented reality is capable of some pretty amazing things too, as it blends the real world around us with the digital world that we usually hold in our hands. The winner for Best AR Experience is Woorld, a sandbox game which lets you play with digital toys in the real world while interacting with all kinds of fun characters and other digital objects. The runners up for this category are Crayola Color Blaster, Holo, WayfairView, and Dinosaurs Among Us. Google play Best App For Kids Kids are the future so why not help that along by giving them something to play with that is not only fun but also engaging, and seeks to foster their creativity in a number of ways. All of the apps in this category do a great job at getting kids to explore and tap into their inspiration, while also being fun and keeping them entertained. The winner for Best App For Kids is Animal Jam – Play Wild!, a casual game that lets kids explore a huge 3D world while taking on the persona of a number of different animals to represent them as their avatar. The game can teach them about real animals and the habitats they live in, while also letting them complete fun quests and chat with other players. The runners up for this category are Hot Wheels: Race Off, Teeny Titans, Toca Life: Vacation, and Think! Think!. Google play Best Multiplayer Game Multiplayer games can feel like the centerpiece of gaming as it does something that single-players games can’t, it brings people together and lets them all enjoy some wonderful content whether just for a few minutes or a few hours. The winner for Best Multiplayer Game is Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment’s wildly popular card battler that takes its inspirations, themes, characters, and really all of the content from the World of Warcraft universe. While you can play Hearthstone by yourself, it hinges mostly on competitive play against others to see who can best their opponent in a heated battle by laying down cards on the board to deplete their opponents health to 0, each card having a unique effect. The runners up for this category are Dawn of Titans, Fifa Mobile, Lords Mobile, and Modern Strike Online. Google play Best App Apps come and go and there are plenty of them on Android, so it should come as no surprise that there was going to be another Best App category this year. The winner for Best App is Memrise, a language learning application that offers a collection of free learning courses in a vast amount of different languages from Japanese to Russian. It makes learning a new language easier than you would think it could be, and it does so while keeping things fun and sort of game like, while also offering users the ability to upgrade to higher levels of difficulty for their chosen language to help them become more proficient in it. The runners up for this category are Money Lover, Quik, Citymapper,  and Fabulous. Google play Best Game Like best app, Best Game was a category that was available last year and just like then, it seeks to highlight the best of the best in the Android game department. There are lots of great games out there for Android, but these are the ones that have stood out the most, and the winner for Best Game is Transformers: Forged To Fight. This game lets you dive into the action as some of your favorite Transformers robots and engage in team battles, collect loot, and even set up bases you need to defend from your enemies. The runners up for this category are Fire Emblem: Heroes, Pokémon GO, Lineage 2 Revolution, and Choices. Google play Best Accessibility Experience This is a new category for this year and it’s one that attempts to highlight apps which make it easier for people to do things like communicate with others to just making things simple and more automated and convenient. The winner for Best Accessibility Experience is IFTTT, which basically lets you automate all sorts of tasks by creating things called applets. IFTTT can be used on your smartphone, but it can also integrate with smart home products to help automate all kinds of stuff like turning on and off lights. The runners up for this category are Open Sesame!, Swiftkey Symbols, A Blind Legend, and Eye-D. Google play Best Social Impact Another new category for this year, Best Social Impact is highlighting apps which are making a pretty big difference on users at a global scale. The winner of Best Social Impact is an app called ShareTheMeal, which is an app that was designed and launched as a means for helping fight the issue of global hunger that kids across the world face each and every day. It’s a charity app that allows use to help fund feeding children with the tap of a button, and you can see where your donations are headed and even learn more about World Hunger. The runners up for this category are Charity Miles, Peek Acuity, ProDeaf, and Sea Hero Quest.

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger There was a fascinating moment towards the end of Wednesday’s hearings of the Senate Inquiry into the Future of Public Interest Journalism. Journalist Michael West was at the stand. West’s experience is in many ways emblematic. Once a marquee investigator for Fairfax Media with multiple scoops to his name, West was made redundant in one of Fairfax’s seemingly endless rounds of job shedding in recent years. He used his redundancy cheque to found a startup, MichaelWest.com.au, and took a position as an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. West has long been a dogged investigator of corporate excess. He pointed out to the hearing that articles he and Neil Chenoweth wrote while at Fairfax several years ago had led directly to a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. The findings of that inquiry – that multinationals like Google and Apple were sending most of their Australian revenues offshore, and paying just cents in the dollar in tax – resulted in tighter laws for global corporations hiding profits in offshore accounts. “As a result of that, in the budget last week, [Treasurer] Scott Morrison said that they were expecting $2.9 billion rather than $2 billion, as originally anticipated, from just seven companies,” West said. So, as a result of political action from the Senate and public interest journalism, there is a billion dollars cash— bang! West added that sources in the Australian Tax Office told him that “there are behavioural changes in the way that multinational companies are regarding this issue of how aggressive they can be on the tax front” and that the ATO is “expecting billions of dollars to flow from that”. Committee member Senator Nick Xenophon then quipped: If only you got one-tenth of one per cent of that, Mr West. Public interest journalism is important for many reasons, including the vital role it plays in holding the powerful to account. But few would have predicted it would play such an instrumental role in plugging Australia’s leaky company tax base. The senate inquiry comes at an important time. With Fairfax Media at play in the stock market and yet more redundancies at the big newspaper publisher announced, for-profit journalism in Australia has never seemed so vulnerable. The market dominance of the two US tech giants Google and Facebook is such that they constitute an effective duopoly on online Australian media. These two companies now control the majority of the eyeballs of ordinary Australians. A single graph from market research firm Nielsen best illustrates this. Facebook and Google dominate the online consumption of Australians. Graph shows sessions per person plotted against active reach; circle size indicates unique audience. Nielsen Digital Ratings, March 2017. Nielsen Digital Ratings, March 2017 You can see that Facebook and Google have reached almost total saturation of the Australian audience in terms of “active reach” (the percentage of people accessing a particular site or platform). Not only do they have the two largest audiences, but they also soak up the most time spent online. Google’s true size is actually obscured by the fact that its subsidiary YouTube is broken out; YouTube and Facebook are ranked one and two for streaming in Australia. When it comes to advertising, the duopoly is just as entrenched. A tweet by analyst Jason Kint went viral in late 2016. He estimated that Facebook and Google’s collective share of global digital advertising revenue was about 70%. All the growth in advertising revenue is being captured by the two duopolists; astonishingly, ad revenue outside the twin giants was actually falling. Given that advertising is increasingly digital and online, the two companies have quickly established market dominance. Australian regulators have been slow to react. While Google is finally beginning to pay a meaningful amount of company tax here, there is apparently no appetite amongst competition or media regulators to come to grips with the digital duopoly. After the ACCC’s embarassing defeat in the High Court in its 2013 case against Google over whether its sponsored links constituted misleading and deceptive conduct, there has been no further attempt to address the company’s market power. When it comes to media regulation, the touch is even lighter. The majority of the content streamed in Australia through YouTube and Netflix is foreign; the Turnbull government has no plans to implement local content quotas on digital streaming. Communications Minister Mitch Fifield has just announced a sweeping deregulation of the existing, weak media policy regime. Google and Facebook are also increasingly important in the distribution of news. The US presidential election and the British referendum on leaving Europe were both marked by massive digital advertising campaigns, often from parties outside the democratic process, that sought to directly influence the outcome. The flap over “fake news” has been dismissed by some as merely the latest example of an eternal phenomenon. That would seem to underestimate the problem. The rise of Facebook and Google as aggregators has made it much easier than before to mimic the appearance and feel of legitimate news sites to produce authentic-looking, hyper-partisan news fakery. A BuzzFeed investigation in 2016 found that “fake news” was shared more widely than real news in the last month of the US presidential election campaign. While some was authored by Macedonian teenagers, much was politically motivated and funded by unknown sources. BuzzFeed analysis of Facebook news pages, mainstream, left and right-leaning categories. Right Wing News has more followers than any of the mainstream pages, and according to Buzzfeed produces 10% ‘mostly false’ reports (red bar). BuzzFeed News. The Data & Society Research Institute has recently published an authoritative report concluding that: the spread of false or misleading information is having real and negative effects on the public consumption of news. What can be done? As the inquiry heard this week, advertising once paid for muscular news organisations in the private sector. It doesn’t any more. The dominance of the aggregators now poses a real challenge to the continued existence of a robust fourth estate, outside of publicly funded media. Still, while regulators have failed to keep up with the rapid pace of industry change, there are models available to address the current malaise. The future of public-interest journalism and the question of what to do about Google and Facebook have been examined in detail in previous government inquiries. In 2011 and 2012, the Gillard government commissioned the Independent Media Inquiry, chaired by Ray Finkelstein, and the Convergence Review, chaired by Glen Boreham. In the feverish atmosphere of the late Gillard government, neither report gained any political traction. Hardly any of their recommendations were taken up. That’s a shame, because they included some valuable suggestions. Local content quotas for free-to-air television are set at 55% in prime time. Rather than impose quotas on overseas digital media companies, Boreham suggested the idea of a “converged content production fund” - partly funded by a levy on them. It could support a range of journalism funding pools, just as the Australia Council or Screen Australia currently distribute funding for particular goals. (It could support, for instance, programs for investigative journalism, grants to news publishers, funding for community newsrooms, and so on). Finkelstein’s inquiry recommended the government consider a public interest journalism fund that would directly subsidise news organisations to conduct investigative journalism. He argued: The subsidy could be defined as a percentage of the wage bill of dedicated investigative journalism units established by publishers. It would be paid annually on the basis of eligible payroll cost in the preceding year. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. We could levy Google and Facebook say, 25% of their domestic advertising revenue and redirect this to fund Australian journalism and other content. Doing so would take Australia towards a more European model of media regulation and subsidy, in which the state plays a prominent role in feeding the hand that bites it. Countries like France and Norway directly fund for-profit media companies, and yet still maintain media diversity and freedom of expression. Norway’s recent bipartisan Commission of Media Diversity, for instance, recommended direct subsidies and tax breaks for newspapers and broadcasters, as well as grants to online media and investigative journalists. While many journalists remain understandably uncomfortable about state funding of the private media, such an outcome may be preferable to the current trend towards declining trust, vanishing scrutiny and fewer and fewer paid jobs in journalism.

At least for now. As expected, Google’s released an Android O beta ahead of its official release date this year. You don’t need to be a developer to try out the early version of Google’s next operating system. You simply need a compatible device, some patience, and some time. The Nexus 5X is getting older but Google’s released an Android O beta preview for the aging former flagship. The update is packed with new features but Google also warns that it might contain errors and defects that could affect the normal functioning of the device. Our guide addresses early Nexus 5X Android O problems. It also takes a look at the Android O update’s performance, the Android Nougat downgrade, and some key things current and prospective beta users need to know about the Nexus 5X’s version of Android O. With an official Nexus 5X Android O release still several weeks away, we plan to update this roundup with new information about the update’s performance. Check back in with us as we poke and prod the Nexus 5X’s version of Android O for problems and features. Nexus 5X Android O Impressions & Performance   1 / 9 Before we get into some quick impressions, here are a few things to know about the Nexus 5X Android O beta download and installation.  The Nexus 5X's Android O update is a little over 1GB. It took us about 45 seconds to download over a high-speed Wi-Fi network. Mileage will vary.  The installation process took about seven minutes to complete which is on par with Google's Android security updates. That surprised us. We thought it would take a lot longer.  We recommend putting aside 20 minutes or so to monitor the download and the installation for problems. Everything went smoothly for us but it's impossible to predict what you'll see. We've been using the Nexus 5X's Android O beta for a few hours now and we've been keeping an eye on battery life, connectivity, and UI speed. We've also been testing our apps and services. Here's what we've noticed thus far.  Battery life appears to be stable. We haven't noticed any weird drain. That obviously could change in the days ahead.  Connectivity is strong. We've been able to connect to multiple ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices including headphones and speakers.  We've experienced some clunkiness when scrolling in the multitasking tray and when pulling down our Quick Settings. We've also noticed choppiness when opening and closing some apps.  This is a noticeable change from Android Nougat. Nougat's animations and transitions are extremely fast and fluid.  Our Nexus 5X randomly rebooted itself shortly after the installation completed. Its only happened once and we're hopeful it was just an anomaly.  The Nexus 5X Android O beta isn't perfect but that's why it's called beta. This isn't the finished product, far from it.  If you're feeling leery, you might want to wait for Google to roll out the next version of Android O. Google will continue to refine its software as we push toward the update's official release date.    1 / 9 4 Responses 05/18/2017 Evangelos Reply Gmail never worked for my Nexus 5x, (open and crush) when android beta installed. After resetting the device, could not boot and was restarting continuously. Thank God is still under warranty and just dropped it off to the retailer. 05/18/2017 5x user Reply How much is the possibility to get Google assistant in the official release of Android o on nexus 5x? 05/18/2017 Brendan Baptiste Reply My device became so slow I had to downgrade out of it. Which wipes your phone by the way. It has some pretty cool features but my 5x was struggling. Web browsing was extremely slow. And cycling between open apps usually involved the wrong app opening. Many apps were sluggish as well. Don’t recommend using the beta. 05/18/2017 Ashok Singh Reply I understand from what I’ve read in XDA Developer forum that the objective was to quickly boot Android O (say 15 secs) and the change in the odex files takes place in the background gradually. Hence, when you install O it will be very slow and there will be problems with the smoothness while changing or starting apps. However, in one or two days it will stabilize. Hence, if you want to try O be prepared to hang around on it for at least 2 days before giving up. Try it on the weekend maybe. Battery life from most sources seems to give 2 hours screen on time (SOT). Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

"Ultimately, a digital assistant is just another user interface. It will only be as good as the ecosystem of devices and services that it is compatible with. Partnerships between tech giants and local service providers will therefore be key differentiators," said Ronan de Renesse, practice leader, Ovum Consumer Technology team and author of the report.  "Here is a disconnect between the 'know-it-all, do-it-all' approach that current digital assistants are aiming toward and the highly personalized virtual assistance experience that consumers have dreams/nightmares about. Whoever can bring personal consumer data in a secure, non-creepy way to digital assistance will be able to bridge that gap and capture most of the opportunity." Read: Google I/O 2017: Android TV Will Soon Have Updated UI, Assistant & 360-Degree Videos According to the report, five major brands and their voice assistants will dominate the voice-assistant segment. Google Assistant will have the biggest chunk of the market and will be installed on nearly a quarter of all devices, at 23 percent. Samsung Bixby will be following with 14.5 percent, Apple’s Siri with 13.1 percent, Amazon’s Alexa with 3.9 percent and Microsoft’s Cortana with 2.3 percent. Google Assistant’s wide presence is not unexpected, owing to the company’s large ecosystem of Android devices. It is even installed on the Samsung Galaxy S8, which also comes with the company Bixby voice assistant pre-installed. According to a report, AI-based voice assistants will be installed on 7.5 billion devices by 2021. Photo: Ovum But, the wild card among the voice assistants is Amazon’s Alexa. While all the other companies have sizeable presence either via a large number of their own devices or their software on other manufacturers’ devices, Amazon Alexa has carved out a special niche for itself. It was actually the first AI-based voice assistant and was launched even before the Google Assistant. It was initially installed on Amazon’s own Echo range of devices, but other manufacturers, such as HTC have now opted for the technology on their phones.. Still, Amazon despite being a retail giant and not a tech company like the others has created a significant footprint for itself in the market. AI-based voice assistant are expected to be installed on 7.5 billion devices by 2021 – their presence will be wider than the number of people on the planet. This growth is owed to their presence of voice assistants on a large number of connected devices including smart speakers, wearable devices, smart TVs, smart home devices and other smart devices. Read: Alexa Connected To The CIA? Amazon Echo Tripped Up By User's Question According to de Renesse, the expansion of voice assistants will bring two major challenges – they will have to be contextualized to different locations globally and they will need to be secure. The large amount of information available to digital assistants presents privacy and security concerns, especially since currently there is no standard security protocol for connected devices such as smart speakers and wearables.

Instead the Android Go is an internal project name for a bunch of improvements that the company has built into Android O, the next version of Android that will reach consumers in the coming months. "There has been some confusion. Android Go is not a separate operating system," Sameer Samat, vice president of product management, old media on the sidelines of the Google I/O here in Mountain View.To emphasise his point Samat added that even if a phone runs the "Android Go", the users will get to see that the phone is running Android O. Also Read: I/O 2017: Google is now searching for the iPhone moment in VR In a way, the Android Go is more of a product for the phone makers. It will be different from Android O because it will probably lack some fancy animations, that tend to require high-end hardware, and will have some specific features like data saving inbuilt. Android Go phones will also come with well-optimised and lighter versions of key Google services so that the overall experience on a budget phone with low-end hardware is good. But all of this will be up to the phone makers. Whether they want to use the full-fledged Android O or if they want to use Android Go will be up to them. In settings and about phone section, the users will see that their phone is powered by Android O. While talking to media Samat also explained the differences between the Android One and Android Go. The big difference is that the Android One was a separate OS, or at least it was pitched as a separate OS. The Android Go, however, is just an internal name within Google. Another difference is that for Android One, Google asked phone makers to abide by some rules. For hardware for an Android phone was selected by Google. The company also asked the phone makers to stick to pure Android theme - no users interface modification - and promised fast and prompt updates.

Smart says that Google doesn't want to choose hardware for its phone partners. It only wants to ensure that Android O (with Android Go features) works well on even those phones that have 512MB RAM. For now Google has no comments to offer on the availability of the Android Go phones or what price points they may hit. Although, it is expected that Android Go phones could come some time after final release of the Android O, which is expected to be around October when Google launches new Pixel phones.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on.

The Play Store should soon tell you if your device is GMS certified or not Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/01/17 6:30am PDTJan 17, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 50 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares137 Google News In October of last year, Cody found strings in his teardown of the Play Store 7.1 that hinted at a mysterious "Device Certification" label. Back then, he theorized that it could be an indicator of whether your device was indeed GMS certified and thus supposed to have the Play Store or it could be a SafetyNet check to see if your firmware was modified in any form. The correct answer turned out to be the first one. Several users have reported the appearance of a "Device certification" menu in the Play Store's settings over the past couple of months, but the option was buggy and not so widespread. With the release of Play Store 7.4.12 (APK Mirror link), more users are spotting it although it doesn't show up for everyone just yet and it still seems buggy. "Device certification" is the last item in the Settings of the Play Store. When it works well, it should tell you if your phone or tablet have been officially approved to run the Play Store and the suite of Google Mobile Services (GMS) apps, which should read as "Certified," or if the Play Store has been transplanted onto your phone without Google's approval, which reads as "Uncertified." Tapping on the menu item will lead you to this Google Support page that explains what the device certification status is and how to interpret the result. But unfortunately, the status isn't properly working yet since many users with Pixels — of all devices — are seeing the "Uncertified" label. That shows that the implementation still isn't completely done. This is one of the first times I can recall Google trying to surface information to users regarding their Android devices and whether or not the Play Store and other Google apps they're running are legit. Granted, the option is hidden in the last line of the Play Store settings, somewhere not many average users will dare venture or even mistakenly look, but it's there nonetheless. And it should give companies that are bypassing Google's certification process and facilitating the unapproved download of GMS apps (think Meizu and many others) a clear "uncertified" label in the consumer's eye... again, if said consumer ever checked the Play Store's settings and scrolled far enough to see it. And if they are rebellious enough to tap on it, they'll get this scary message on Google's Support page: If your device is uncertified, Google doesn’t have a record of the Android compatibility test results. Please keep in mind that: Uncertified devices may not be secure. Uncertified devices may not get Android system updates, or app updates. Google apps on uncertified devices aren't licensed and may not be real Google apps. Apps and features on uncertified devices may not work correctly. Data on uncertified devices may not back up securely. Maybe that'll be enough to deter a small percentage of users away from uncertified manufacturers and non Google partners who are releasing these devices, but it likely won't have such a big impact. If Google plans on cracking down on these OEMs, which I'm not sure is 100% in Google's best interest for now to be completely honest, more drastic steps will need to be taken to stop them from benefitting from GMS apps at all.

Another headache(?) for root users. steelew I really wish they would allow root/admin user. It's 2017 already, why is everybody still scared to let users have admin rights? I can do as i please with my windows system but god forbid I try to do the same on my phone. No wonder tablets didn't supplant PC's. Post PC world my arse. Naga Sridhar Bcoz not everyone is skilled enough to use the power of root/admin! This could allow for more security exploits and which could lead to more articles stating, Android is not secure! Lon Grove The average person doesn't even know about unlocking developer mode let alone the extra steps a supposed admin mode would require. Allowing this wouldn't compromise security for those that don't take the time to learn about and unlock root/admin mode. Suicide_Note But it still compromises security for those who do root, which banks and media companies, among others aren't very comfortable with. Lon Grove That's the point though. User choice = user beware. Suicide_Note I understand, but Google is more concerned with the many, not the few. blindexecutioner It's already very difficult for the average user to get root access. It isn't like you can just stumble upon it the way you could go in and mess with system32 on Windows. steelew When you buy something outright and when you've had that access (PC's for the last 20-some odd years) , it's a little hard to put that genie back in the bottle. Bewear I totally agree with you. Lord Argyris Hopefully Google doesn't eventually choose to do something dumb like block Play Store access to devices that don't come up "certified" using this check. Apart from false positives (like the Pixels that are evidently currently coming up "uncertified"), this would also affect people using custom ROMs and those who choose to sideload the Play Store onto devices like Amazon's tablets. Randroid I was thinking the same. This could very well be step 1 in the process. Testing to see if it validates properly, and displaying the results of that validation. The next step (or maybe even further down the road) may be to use that value to stop access to the Play Store, or stop apps from updating from the Play Store, or do just about anything if it comes up as "Uncertified". I really hope that doesn't happen. saf1927 Well, they can already tell whether your phone is certified or not. This being shown to users or not doesn't change the fact that if they wanted to, they could have done this a while back. I don't think they will block the Play Store, it doesn't make any sense in the first place. However it might be used as an excuse to say "no support is offered should you have any issues with apps compatibility, purchases, etc." Hopefully it isn't the case. AQ They could at the very least block users on uncertified devices from rating/reviewing apps/content, at most block downloading/updating of google apps & at worse all apps/content. But imho devices that have been certified should have access when ROM'd. Valery Babanin Well, I hope they will do something like that to prevent Samsung and Microsoft from using Android Apps on Tizen and Windows without any permission. P.S. My Pixel is "Certified" Suicide_Note My Pixel XL direct from Google comes up as NOT certified. My guess is it's because I've unlocked the bootloader. Everything else is stock. Valery Babanin Interesting. I think many people here want to know if it will change after relocking. Suicide_Note Unfortunately i can't say, because I'm not interested in having my phone wiped by relocking the bootloader. 😄 Max My Pixel XL appears as Certified so it definitely may be related to the unlocked bootloader. Kawshik Ahmed Google can't block Samsung or Microsoft from using Android app this way because Tizen or Windows Mobile won't need Play Store they just need the AOSP part because that part is Open Source, Google can't block it. This is more for OEM that ships Play Services without Google's certification. Naga Sridhar I guess you are missing the point! Samsung or Microsoft have their OS hence they dont need AOSP. What they need for their products to sell is an Android Play store which they can add by sideloading. That is what this could prevent them from doing, if they at all chose this route! Kawshik Ahmed If they add Play Store in an non-Android(TM) OS Google will take them to court because it will be easy to find. But it is hard to find no-brand OEM who are putting Play Store in their non-GMS certified Android devices. It mechanism will help customers know if their devices are truly Google Approved or not. squiddy20 Pretty sure Android Police (or some other Android-centric website) ran a piece on some Chinese manufacturer that was selling Android handsets, and having the users install the Play Store, and were getting away with it. That was several months back, and I've heard no word on it since. Lucas de Eiroz ™ They need AOSP to understand how an app interact with Android to emulate it on their own OS. They do not need Play Store, because the point is to sideload apks, not Google Play Store. I am 100% sure Samsung and Microsoft don't want Google's Store in their systems... TedPhillips Large organizations like that are subject to copyright claims if they are distributing the play store without Google's blessing. APK/Android tech itself is free to use ala Amazon. Luke Richardson Me too. I've had to sideload Google Services onto both my phone (Xiaomi Mi Max) and my tablet (Lenovo Yoga Book) because the Chinese market firmwares for these don't include Google Services (I live in China). For my Mi Max I could theoretically install the Global ROM, but then I'd miss out on some Chinese market features that I actually use, but for my Yoga Book I don't even have that option as Lenovo doesn't make the firmware freely accessible. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Like my Umi Super stock rom isnt certified. By default, certain versions of Android Wear didn't run unless you change ro.build.prop from user to userdebug. Then there is Beta roms like Xiaomi does. I'm sure they aren't paying for officially certification across all those devices every week. What's Google intent here? Lucas de Eiroz ™ They don't need to pay GMS certification in every update... Matthew Scott Smith Uncertified devices may not get Android system updates, or app updates. ahaha...ahahahaha...hahaha....ha....aha....that doesn't happen anyway. Samsung/LG/HTC/basically all Android device manufacturers who modify their OS all to hell and then lag on updates. Naga Sridhar I agree, they don't get Android system updates as quickly however not getting app updates would suck! blindexecutioner This would only hurt Android as people would simply run outdated software or find it outside of the Play Store. MJ My phone doesn't have a "Device Certification" section yet but I can't wait to find out if my Pixel XL is GMS certified or not. :-) Suicide_Note Mine shows up as uncertified, but it's likely due to having the bootloader unlocked. Dan Raaka if bootloader unlocked, then it will show up as uncertified. if the build fingerprint ($adb shell getprop | grep finger) is not certified by the OEM, then it will show up as uncertified if the build spoofs another legit device, then its likely going to appear as uncertified. Suicide_Note The weird thing is that my Pixel XL, bought from Google, is deemed uncertified. As i mentioned when i sent this in to AP, I'm guessing it's due to having unlocked my bootloader, because my phone is otherwise unmodified. lomsha It's probably that. My 6p which just has an unlocked bootloader also shows uncertified. Thor Shows certified on my Pixel XL. Had posted a screenshot few days ago in the Play Store 7.4 teardown article. I had it even on Play Store 7.3. https://disqus.com/home/discussion/androidpolice/play_store_v74_reveals_a_new_my_apps_screen_remote_authorization_for_family_purchases_and_more_apk_t/#comment-3093683377 http://i.imgur.com/ZC8feYH.png posito75 This is the effect of the European Union rules on Google. If the phone is not GMS certified, it will not have access to the play store. You can get Android for free, but you cannot have the play store for free. Cause and effect...﻿ matteventu LOL bullshit. Source? Luca That doesn't even make sense... riki Whaat, my Galaxy S7 Edgev(7.0) say Uncertified https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6fde5ce13ea0594f70e68cfed9351690af1ea61aea5dc0aabe2308ecdeee0f4c.png :'v YaKillaCJ Hmm well I wonder what Google intent here. I personally have several devices I'm sure will fail the pass. Only 2 device I own "could" pass because I'm running the official beta roms on my Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 Pro and Umi Super but they are also unlocked bootloader, twrp, rooted, xposed, etc. Every other device I have is on a custom rom. blindexecutioner Probably a way in the future to deny you certain apps. Probably banking type apps and things like that. Bewear Banking and Pokémon GO, ruining things for us one step at a time. ustill812 the status isn't properly working yet since many users with Pixels — of all devices — are seeing the "Uncertified" label. Maybe the status is just fine and it's the phones that aren't properly working :-D h4rr4r Uncertified devices may not get Android system updates, or app updates. So just like certified devices! Bewear In fact, uncertified devices are the ones that can get unofficial updates even earlier! JD So what is the plan here Google? Evil or no evil? Ernie I have this playstore version and don't see this. Suicide_Note It's only popping up sporadically. Dan Raaka Its rolling out .. TedPhillips Ratcheting the safety net noose ever tighter... SpasilliumNexus Shows up here on a 3T with OxygenOS 4.0.2. I didn't see it earlier today before I updated from 4.0.1.

The average person probably isn't going to bother digging down into the Play Store settings to spot this... Only us geeks and nerds will be snooping around in the settings menu... And we'd likely already know if the device should be certified or not. Especially considering we're the one who probably "transplanted" the Play Store onto the Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet in the first place. Rob Is the Note 7 showing up as certified, anyone? 🤣 Legion Yesterday I noticed that there was no longer an option to review apps on Google Play, I can only rate apps. Trying to figure out why, I noticed this 'certification ' in Settings'... my OPPO Find 7 is not 'certified'. "Apps and features on uncertified devices may not work correctly" says the Google crack-heads. Thanks, crack-heads, for breaking that which is not broke.. Jim-Kasey Sylvester My Samsung galaxy S3 is now showing uncertified and apps are not updating. I hope they fix this! Abdullah I have an Xperia ZL and it just started to show up as Uncertified despite the fact that I can update apps normally. I previously unlocked the bootloader and then relocked. I think uncertification is due to this. Any idea guys? Jeder I wonder why my LG G3 does not have certificate although LG is certified rustygh We should all realize google's intentions are nothing to do with security, or stopping Microsoft or Samsung, and everything to do with controlling. Great company getting shitty fast. Rahul Chaturvedi I buy a new Swipe Elite Power from Flipkart.com and I have same problem i.e. the device is uncertified senoredusty My Pixel XL is not certified, so it has to be in relation to being rooted or having an unlocked bootloader. Casey Robertson Man, the worst thing Google could possibly do is try to crack down on the modding community. I swear, everything they do seems to be to close the Android OS up. People use Android because they don't like how closed iOS is. Does Google really want to see how it's users will react? I know, that's jumping to conclusions. I just really hope they don't go down this path.

[Update: There will be an unlocked model too] The ZenFone AR will be a Verizon exclusive in the United States Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 12:28pm PDTMay 18, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 17 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares71 ASUS News Verizon Wireless Update 1: 2017/05/18 4:07pm PDT It seems Verizon's press release was misleading. ASUS has confirmed to us that an unlocked model will be available in the United States as well, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. Mobile VR hasn't really taken off, and Google's augmented-reality Project Tango experiment is in the same boat. The first publicly-available phone with Project Tango, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro, launched last year. If you read our review, you'll know that the massive size, poor performance, and price made it hard sell even for VR/AR enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the upcoming Tango-powered ZenFone AR already has a major flaw; it will be Verizon-exclusive in the United States. This seems like a dumb move, as the market for this phone was already incredibly tiny, and now even less people will be inclined to buy it. If you need a refresher, the ZenFone AR was announced back in January with a Snapdragon 821 CPU, up to 8GB of RAM, a 5.7" 1440p display, and Android 7.0. Verizon neglected to announce pricing, but it will be available from Big Red this summer. Update 1: 2017/05/18 4:07pm PDT It seems Verizon's press release was misleading. ASUS has confirmed to us that an unlocked model will be available in the United States as well, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. End of Update Press Release MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today at Google I/O, ASUS announced that Verizon will be the exclusive wireless provider of the ZenFone AR in the United States. The next-generation smartphone represents a significant advancement in mobile virtual and augmented reality technologies. The ZenFone AR is the world's first smartphone that supports both Tango AR and Daydream VR technologies developed by Google, giving users totally new ways to engage with and be entertained by their smartphones. During Google I/O, Johnny Lee, head of the Google Tango team, demonstrated Tango and Daydream on the ZenFone AR. The ZenFone AR will come with the Android 7.0 Nougat OS with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, and will be available this summer at Verizon. Tango is an augmented reality (AR) platform that uses qualified devices to detect their users' positions relative to places and objects around them without using GPS or other external signals. This allows application developers to create AR experiences that include indoor navigation, 3D mapping, and environmental recognition, among other augmented reality applications. Daydream is a high-quality virtual reality (VR) platform that is built into the Android operating system to support VR apps. The ASUS ZenFone AR was developed in close cooperation with Google to deliver the best user experience on both Tango and Daydream platforms. Ideal for AR and VR Tango adds three abilities to the ZenFone AR: motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. Through these capabilities, the ZenFone AR can detect how far it is away from a floor, wall or an object and understand where it is moving in three-dimensional space. AR is a rapidly growing segment for mobile technology and one consumers are extremely excited about. To date, there are over 100 Tango compatible apps on Google Play1. ASUS and Google are also partnering with well-known brands to bring the Tango AR experience to customers. For VR, the large, high-resolution and high-contrast display of the ZenFone AR makes it ideal for VR applications when used as a VR display mounted in the Daydream View headset. The ZenFone AR’s expansive 5.7-inch screen immerses the viewer in whatever VR world is being presented, while the WQHD (1440 x 2560) resolution presents images with extreme clarity and deep black hues enabled by the high-contrast super AMOLED technology which enhances the 3D effect of the screen. Powerful Supporting Hardware To make the ZenFone AR an ideal VR and AR smartphone, it has been designed with the latest top-of-the-line components that also make it one of the most powerful smartphones in the market: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8212 Processor: The Snapdragon 821 processor used by the ZenFone AR has been specially optimized for AR operations. ASUS worked closely with Qualcomm Technologies engineers and Google to efficiently distribute computer vision workloads. Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 GPU: With 6GB of RAM and the desktop-class Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 graphics processing unit (GPU) that delivers supercharged graphics performance, the ZenFone AR handles the visual graphic demands of Tango and Daydream with ease. Superior Hi-Res Audio and DTS Virtual Surround Sound: Complementing the rich AR & VR experiences offered by the ZenFone AR is a new audio system that supports Hi-Res Audio and DTS virtual surround sound. External audio also gets a boost with the ZenFone AR’s new ultra-loud 5-magnet speaker. Photographic Maestro: The ZenFone AR is also an accomplished camera smartphone. It has the same ASUS PixelMaster 3.0 camera system found in the ZenFone AR that comprises of the world's highest resolution Sony IMX318 sensor and TriTech Autofocus system. AVAILABILITY & PRICING The ZenFone AR will be available with 6GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, with Verizon as the exclusive wireless provider, in the United States in summer 2017. Pricing will be announced at a later date. 1 Tango apps on Google play: http://get.google.com/tango/apps/ 2 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 for Tango information: https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/devices/tango ### About ASUS ASUS is one of Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies, and is dedicated to creating products for today and tomorrow’s smart life.

Dumb dumb dumb... Corbin Davenport Well, the Pixel/Pixel XL was still available unlocked and on Project Fi. This probably won't be. SyCoREAPER Not on Verizon anymore but at least it isn't another goddamn Motorola device which was pretty much all they offered last I had them raffr Considering google's inability to keep the phone in stock, i think it matters little that verizon is the only carrier selling the Pixel. lomsha Lack of stock doesn't automatically equal crazy demand if they only produce puny amounts. ProductFRED Yeah, and that's a device people actually wanted to begin with... raffr ' This seems like an incredibly dumb move by ASUS.." you are assuming other carriers even wanted to sell this phone! _jsw_ I think the idea is that an unlocked version would likely be at least as likely to sell because, let's face it, this is a developer/early adopter phone, so the more places it can be bought, the more phones they'll sell. Toan Ngo Way to kill adoption! SyCoREAPER Everyone here is assuming this is a great phone, it sounds great. For all you know it's going to be a flop, a Verizon exclusive flop mxwp if the review for the prior phone is any indication SyCoREAPER Same could have been argued for Samsung, but it literally blew up in their face. ha I've got jokes. The point stands though, you never know. Liam Bulkley Specs are wrong. According to your link (and the asus site), the zenfone ar will have a Snapdragon 821 w/8gb ram. No mention of battery, though 5Ah sounds right to me considering how tango needs all the emfs. I hope the next Pixel has tango compatible hardware. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Marty Don't really get the Project Tango significance, but the phone seems to have good specs. Too big for my tastes, though. DrunkSpock Tango is pretty magical actually, I've been doing some development with their devkit a while now. It can place spatially oriented 3D objects into your camera stream with micro-millimeter precision. Fun stuff. Frank King With all those OEMs fighting to come up with special features, I'm kinda surprised there is still so few Tango devices.. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Damn I was interested in this phone. I like AR/VR even if it's a fad right now. Was trying to decide between pixel2, zenfone AR, and the OnePlus 5. As a T-Mobile customer guess my decision got easier. Kenny’s Turtle "This seems like an incredibly dumb move by ASUS, as the market for this phone was already incredibly tiny, and now even less people will be inclined to buy it." Not sure how being sold in the number one mobile network's stores is a dumb move, considering all of their previous phones couldn't even be used on the Verizon network. The Phab 2 Pro has been available to all GSM mobile users since its launch. How are those sales numbers? Maybe a different approach isn't so dumb after all. _jsw_ The P2P is a piece of crap. It wouldn't have sold any more had it been a Verizon exclusive. _jsw_ Is this "exclusively Verizon" in the sense that it will not be available to buy *anywhere* else, or "exclusively Verizon" like the Pixel? "Verizon as the exclusive wireless provider" is ambiguous. Artem Russakovskii Yup, that. Fucking Verizon. _jsw_ Fucking Verizon indeed. I've been waiting for a decent Tango device for so long that I might do shameful things to get this, though. Maybe. Hopefully there will be rumors of a Pixel Tango by the time this comes out. Artem Russakovskii Wait, did you see the update to the post? _jsw_ Um... no. :o Came here directly from the email notification. But, on the other hand, thinking it was confirmed I'd have to get it from Verizon and then finding out that an unlocked model will be available makes it even better! Sometimes being inept pays off! Nathan J Nice to see Asus phones working in the US, but mid-rangers with hardware keys? In 2017? Come on now. Bring premium phones to the US.

In fact we’ve seen quite a few platforms support the feature, such as with Facebook Messenger and Gmail, and soon it seems that you can use Google Assistant to perform such actions too, as confirmed by Google on its Android Developers blog. According to Google, “In the upcoming months, we’ll also enable people in the U.S. to send or receive payments via the Google Assistant. On your Google Home or Android device, it’s as simple as saying “Ok Google, send $10 to Jane for pizza.” All you need is a debit card linked to your Google account.” As you can see from the GIF on the right, using your voice is just the first step and users will need to use their fingerprints to verify and authenticate themselves before the transfer takes place. This means that users won’t need to go through separate apps or swap between multiple apps and remember account numbers to make transfers. Of course all of this is designed to keep users within Google’s ecosystem, but we can imagine that it will be much more convenient. No word on when the feature will roll out so we guess users will just have to keep an eye out for it. Filed in Cellphones.

Clay Bavor, the VP of VR and augmented reality at Google, said at the Google I/O 2017 that he was very pleased with the progress the company was making VR but the big breakthrough that would popularise the dorky headsets was still awaited. "In the last six months after launching Daydream (Google's VR platform) we are very pleased with the progress we have made," said Bavor. "But we are long way from reaching the iPhone moment in the VR." Bavor's comments came in response to a question about the perceived slow progress of the VR and related gadgets. A number of companies, including Facebook that now owns Oculus and HTC that has made Vive VR headset, are working on virtual reality. Microsoft too has something in the works under the HoloLens program, although it is more into the domain of augmented reality. While the technologies are exciting, so far the VR products have failed to catch the fancy of consumers. Also Read: Google I/O 2017: Android Go, new VR headset, Google Lens and other key announcements Most of the VR headsets like Oculus and Vive are very expensive. The cheaper ones, which are part of Google Daydream platform, aren't that useful and exciting. But Bavor believes that people should not compare the progress VR platforms with the pace at which smartphone rose. He believes that for smartphones too the gains were incremental in the beginning and it was only after the iPhone hit the market in 2007 that the pace at which smartphones matured quickened. "If you use the right comparison point, VR is playing out at the right pace," he said. At this year's I/O, Google has announced that it is now developing a new standalone VR platform. Earlier, the company came out with the Cardboard, which was just a very cheap headset made of cardboard and couple of lenses. It was to be used with a smartphone. Last year it announced the Daydream, which was better than the cardboard (call it more sophisticated cardboard) but it too requires a compatible smartphone. This is set to change by the end of this year. Google has said that now it is working on a standalone VR headset that will be manufactured by HTC and Lenovo, to start with. This VR headset will work on its own and it will come with a technology called WorldSense that will help the users get a better feel of the virtual environment. It will also have high-end hardware inside it, similar to what is there in devices like Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. Although Google has not talked about the specifics of the hardware, Bavor said it will have a powerful mobile processor, high-quality display unit and a number of sensors that will monitor the movement of the user. The cost too will be high compared to the existing Daydream headset. "We worked closely with Qualcomm to create a standalone headset reference design, which partners can use as a blueprint to build from. HTC VIVE, a leader in the VR space, and Lenovo, a leader in mobile and computing, are both working on devices, with the first ones coming later this year," said Bavor. Google is also working to ensure that the performance aspect of its standalone VR headset is top notch. It says that it is working on something Seurat, which will allow developers to create p[hoto-realistic virtual worlds in real time. "It uses some clever tricks to help you achieve desktop-level graphics or better with a mobile GPU. Seurat enabled ILMxLAB, the branch of Lucasfilm focused on pioneering next generation immersive experiences, to bring the cinema-quality world of Rogue One to a mobile VR headset," says Bavor. For Google VR is apparently very important because the company believes it will help it solve several users problems. "With something VR we can help people relive memories - for example a wedding memory - by letting them enter a memory in virtual world," said Bavor. At the same time, it is also important because many companies including Facebook believes VR is the next big thing in the world of technology. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg - and very few people are as smart as Zuckerberg - is so convinced that VR is going to reshape the world that he spent nearly $3 billion to acquire Oculus earlier. For Google, a standalone VR headset will help it compete better with companies Facebook whenever VR gets big. Augmented reality too gets a push At the I/O 2017, Google is also talking about the Tango platform, which is company's effort to create smartphones that have augmented reality inbuilt in them. Google has said that it has worked with Asus to create a new Tango phone, which will be launched in the coming months. As a feature update, Google is adding VPS (virtual positioning system) in Tango, enabling better indoor navigation. Also Read: Google Play Protect app scanner will keep your Android phone safe, here is how to get it Bavor believes that the VPS is a very powerful technology and to can one day even help people with poor or no vision navigate the world around them. Already, Google is apparently using VPS for indoor navigation - for example in a store - using what a camera in a phone sees and using the data collected from planograms. "With Tango, devices can provide indoor directions and place digital objects in the space around us. You can see what furniture looks like in your bedroom before you buy it, build interactive worlds in your living room, or summon dinosaurs into your kitchen to learn more about them," said Bavor.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 19 May 2017 | MYT 12:30 PM Google’s digital Assistant is hobbled on Apple’s iPhone The reality for iPhone users is that the Google Assistant will probably never beat Apple Inc's Siri on its home turf. — Reuters Some people think Google's virtual assistant beats Siri in reliability and capability. That may be true on Google's own devices, like the Pixel smartphone, but the Assistant is hobbled on the iPhone.  During the keynote at the Google I/O conference this week, the Internet giant unveiled a version of its Assistant as an app for the iPhone. It has a slick design, integrates the company's ubiquitous search engine, and taps into Google services like Gmail and Google Calendar. The crowd of developers in the audience cheered: millions of new iPhone users to reach for innovative voice-based interactions.  But the reality for iPhone users is that the Google Assistant will probably never beat Apple Inc's Siri on its home turf. That's bad news for the Alphabet Inc unit, which wants its voice-based technology everywhere. Here are some of the limitations:  You have to download it from the App Store. While Siri is fully baked into the iPhone from the first time you turn it on, the only way to get Google Assistant on your iPhone is to download it from Apple's App Store. This may seem obvious as it is a third-party program, but the process of finding the app, installing it, and placing it in an ideal spot on your home screen is significant friction that will likely limit adoption and usage.  On Google's Pixel phone, there are none of these potential road blocks. You can't launch it with your iPhone's home button or with your voice. To launch Siri on your iPhone, you just click the home button for a couple of seconds. You can also say "Hey, Siri” if you have more recent hardware.  With the Google Assistant app, you have to either use a shortcut in the widget panel left of the iPhone's first home screen or find the app icon. You also can't launch the app by saying “OK, Google,” but you can use the phrase if you already have the app open.  This relatively small inconvenience can be a deal breaker as one of the selling points of a comprehensive voice assistant is to avoid tapping and switching between different apps.  You can't tap into basic iPhone functions and settings. Siri is one of the quickest ways to turn on Airplane Mode, or Do Not Disturb, or create alarms. Google Assistant on the iPhone can't integrate deeply enough into Apple's iOS operating system to pull off those actions.  It does let you input calendar appointments, set timers, jot down shopping lists, look up contacts, and get reminders, but all of that functionality works only with Google's own services. If you're in the iCloud ecosystem – using built-in core mobile features like Apple's calendar or contacts – you'll probably stick with Siri.  You can't launch apps, search some Apple content stores, or pull up photos. One of the most handy Siri features is the ability to search for App Store apps, iTunes movies, and photo albums with your voice. Google Assistant can't tap into those features, although you can search for Apple Music songs and it will send you to that app. Similarly, you can't ask Google to launch Apple apps on your iPhone, like the calculator or a sports news app, but you can launch many Google-made apps that are installed on the iPhone.  You can't integrate with other non-Google apps on your iPhone. Siri sends you seamlessly into Uber or Lyft apps to order a ride, send a text message via WhatsApp, or post to Twitter. With Google Assistant on the iPhone, the extent of most app integration ends at Google services like YouTube and Gmail. (Google says Apple Music is again an exception).  Google has chat bots (called Actions on Google) for various news, productivity and travel services, but there are limitations since the system is not tapping into actual apps on the iPhone. Google says deeper third-party app integration is coming. Integrated Apple services typically require an extra step.  While many Apple apps and services don't play nicely with Google Assistant, some do work. Namely, text messaging, and making phone calls. However, texts and calls require an extra step. Asking Siri to send a message, or call a colleague puts Apple's assistant to work instantly. Google's Assistant requires tapping an extra button to confirm those actions.  You can't easily use it in the car. Siri is deeply integrated into your car's Bluetooth system. Users can either hold down the iPhone home button, hit an assigned key on a steering wheel, or say the Siri voice command. Google Assistant on iPhones doesn't have this level of integration, making it a non-starter in the car.  Altogether, unless you are deeply in the Google ecosystem, using Google Assistant on the iPhone is a pain compared to Siri. Of course, over time, it is possible that Apple will open up more functionality to the Google Assistant.  For now, however, Google Assistant on the iPhone does have one or two advantages over Siri, even for those in the Apple apps and services world.  You can type into the Assistant. This is great for situations where you want to quickly get a task done without speaking out loud. And if you have a Google Home speaker, the Assistant on the iPhone integrates well with that device for controlling other connected home gadgets. — Bloomberg Related Stories You May Be Interested Uber renews push for arbitration in Waymo trade-secrets case Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Mums treated to hearty buffet brunch on special day DPM: There's no excuse for cops to flout the law Check out Sungai Buloh's Valley of Hope advertisement Latest News UK’s May opens door to Facebook tax in push for safer web Google wants all online ads to run on its speedy mobile formats Microsoft to open Africa datacentres to seek edge in cloud push Uber renews push for arbitration in Waymo trade-secrets case Security experts find clues to ransomware worm’s lingering risks Most Viewed in Tech WannaCry ransomware: should users pay the ransom money?

So at I/O in Mountain View, the company moved t allay security fears over the Android and launched a new service called Play Protect. Part of the Google Play, the Protect will overtly scan apps on a phone and let users find out if there are rogue and dangerous apps running in the background on their phones. The Protect will be inbuilt inside the Play, the app through which Android users download apps. Edward Cunningham, product manager at Android security, says that Google already does enough to keep Android safe. He says that Google's security servers constantly scan and keep an eye on the Play store that there are no rogue apps in it. "With more than 50 billion apps scanned every day, our machine learning systems are always on the lookout for new risks, identifying potentially harmful apps and keeping them off your device or removing them. All Google Play apps go through a rigorous security analysis even before they're published on the Play Store," he says. Also Read: Google I/O 2017: Android Go, new VR headset, Google Lens and other key announcements But Google acknowledges that there are areas that can be improved. At the same time, there is the perception that Google Android is not very safe, and definitely not as safe as Apple's iOS. "We know you want to be confident that your Android devices are safe and secure," says Cunningham. This is the perception which Google seem to be tackling with the Play protect. By putting a specific security feature in the phone, and giving users control to scan any app at will, Google is trying to bolster people's perception in the Android. The Play Protect will also allow users to scan the apps that have been downloaded from the web and not from the Play store. "Play Protect warns you about bad apps that are downloaded from other sources too. Play Protect watches out for any app that might step out of line on your device, keeping you and every other Android user safe," says Cunningham. Although Google has always maintained that Android is very safe, the Android security is a touchy topic with users, especially in countries like India. This is one of the reasons why almost every Android phone in India nowadays comes with a security app pre-installed on it. These apps look similar to the security apps that people have seen on their computers. These apps also claim to offer features like virus scanner, firewall and others that are familiar to consumers. Also Read: For India, Android Go is Google's biggest announcement at I/O 2017 Although in most cases, these are useless apps given the fact that seem to inspire confidence among users, they are very popular and it seems that with protect Google is trying to keep users away from the so called Android virus scanners that in most cases are nothing more than snake oil. How to get Play Protect As mentioned earlier, the Play Protect is part of the Play store. so if you have the Play store on your phone, as soon as this apps gets updated, you will get the Play protect on your phone. Considering this is Google we are talking about, it might be a few days, or even weeks, before the Play Protect is added to you Play store app. Once the Protect feature has been added you will be able to access it through: -- Open the Play app on your phone -- Map on the menu, which are three lines on the left of the screen. From menu, select Protect. Disclaimer: The reporter's travel and stay for this event in Mountain View, California have been arranged by Google.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...?

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see.

View All 52 Articles In This Series During today's keynote at Google I/O, Google revealed a couple of interesting figures about the upcoming Android O release. Namely, it should be a lot faster in certain regards. Google says that the Pixel, for example, will reboot up to twice as fast on Android O (it does take a while at the moment). It wasn't immediately clear what optimizations allowed for this boosted performance. As in the hero image of this post, Google also alluded to improved performance for apps at large. Using Google Sheets as an example, Google claimed that when running a set of typical workload benchmarks in the app, Sheets completed operations over twice as quickly in these scenarios. How exactly this is happening, again, is unclear. But it's certainly good news - faster apps are better apps. The improved reboot times should further reduce the amount of time necessary to install an OTA update on your device. Last year at I/O, Google announced seamless updates, allowing you to install updates on your phone in the background on a separate system partition while you can continue to use the device. Rebooting is still something that has to happen with seamless updates, though, and it sounds like Android O should make that process even faster.

No one here can come with new jokes? marcusmarcus2 No kidding. People keep making this joke more than Google makes messaging apps. Kinda ridiculous. Corey Kinard Quality post. Fernando Pena She is like that overexcited character from an episode of Friends... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DJblHzEdLw 4Ui812 Google Sheets and twice as fast eh ? Maybe the O stands for orgasm :-) T4rd The Spotlight I'm waiting for: "Apps can no longer hide behind 'Android OS' or 'Android System' in the battery stats." blindexecutioner I agree. I know the LED notification managing apps do that. I am not sure it is to be sneaky about it but rather it's just probably how the system is designed. I still think they're worth it but a lot of times people have no idea an app is what is causing their drain and they blame Android/Google for it. Winston That by itself would warrant a totally new letter release for me. As Trump would say, it's YUUGE. On Samsung at least, it now tells you approximately how much battery an app is draining. Interesting statistic: WhatsApp drains between four to seven times more battery than *fking Snapchat*. Teja Hell yeah! Android system is taking 15-20% of my battery on my Oneplus 3. Still can't figure which package is causing this. I at least hope they give individual battery stats for packages included in the so called "Android OS" and "Android System" marcusmarcus2 This will greatly improve the bootloop speeds of some devices. Christopher Kruthoff Clearly the real reason behind such a feature! VAVAMk_2 LG I am looking at you... marcusmarcus2 Oh yeah, well LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... ...LG is looking at... Roh_Mish Youuuu you you, youuuu, you you yooooooooooo Fernando Pena This is probably true, my phone is A LOT faster after DP2 update. I mean, even faster than the latest stable nougat version. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach I noticed this two on my Nexus 6p. It boots faster than my S8. Fernando Pena I meant overall performance, apps, system and boot as well... Jey How's the battery work far? Fernando Pena I can't say anything battery just yet, let's see how it performs overnight and along the day tomorrow... Tr3ple On my pixel too, I'm impressed blindexecutioner Lol,yeah, ok. I am sure battery life will be quadrupled too. balthazar Could, would, should, won't ... Roy Let's be optimistic and maybe on the Pixel it will. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach Does the S8 support seamless updates? Tim Harman Why would it matter? Samsung will stop providing updates for it as soon as the S9 comes out. (I actually did some Google for you and the answer seems to be "No" but I couldn't find anything confirming it one way or another) D13H4RD2L1V3 Nope. The only phone that supports seamless updates is the Pixel. Corey Kinard Hopefully the OP5 goes for it. It's only a feature useful for phones that actually get updated. JD Except the downside is it takes up a chunk of your Storage Corey Kinard I think the majority of the "chunks of storage" I allow things to take up, I allow expressly so it makes my life easier. This fits that bill too imo. If 32 is going to be the new default, I'm willing to let the system eat up an extra gig if it's adding something useful. I wish manufacturers were forced to display the usable amount of memory their phone ships with anyway. It makes no sense to me that two phones can advertise they both come with 32 gigs and Storage and when you open one up you're getting 25 and with the other 18. Winston No. My phone's day one patch installed as it usually does. Lord Argyris "Google says that the Pixel, for example, will reboot up to twice as fast on Android O..." I wonder how many lifetimes they reckon this saves. bL4Ck Cool, but when a phone starts in a decent amount of time isn't that already good enough? After all these years of smartphones i don't think many turn off their phones at all unless they have to, my 6P often reaches 3-4 weeks of up-time then i randomly restart it for reasons or because play services starts acting weird and drains the battery. I feel like they're putting their focus on the wrong problems, slow boot times was an issue 10 years ago when people were still used to Nokia phones having basic features work even when switched off, but now people either put their phones in airplane mode during the night or switch them to silent, so having twice as fast boot up times isn't going to affect anyone's life in any meaningful way. Winston I think it was really just for show, as the most visible change in the speed. Most things on phones don't really take that long anymore, and they wanted to highlight just how fast the new OS is, so they reduced the boot time by half. JD The conversation started like this. Googler 1: Android and Play services is a mess we have no fucking clue how to fix all these issues. Googler 2: Have we tried making new messaging apps? Googler 1: Yes but that didn't fix anything Googler 2: Add more Emojis and Sticker packs so they can vent their frustrations? Googler 1: Yes but still it didn't fix the bugs Googler 2: What do you think would fix it then? Googler 1: I told you we don't know how, I have to keep rebooting my phone just to keep it working. Googler 2: Genius! You solved it! Just make the phone reboot faster! Maybe make it loop automatically. Googler 1: Why did LG let you go again? Maxwell “Max” Weinbach yep Stu The estimates are probably generous but I do feel like Android has finally matured with nougat and it would make sense if the OS became a lot more refined from this point forward. Not a parallel comparison obviously, but you saw similar with iOS. JD The last time it matured was with 4.4 then Google decided it was time trade the T mature for an N in 5.0 and kept that up all the way in to 7.0 Beebs Vaporware. Samsung has me on Android 4.4 kit kat D13H4RD2L1V3 Well, I wonder how this translates to actual real-world use. Like is it possible to notice the difference? From what I've heard, that seems to be the case. deh2002 Will be great for LG buyer's Dmitry Stepanushkin 2x faster bootloops? LineOS for exynos! LMAO! But I love lg just1box Google needs to focus on ONLY THREE things. 1. steamlined/faster OS updates 2. SINGLE All in one rich text messaging app standard across ALL devices and web/PC app 3. really goose Dev's to optimize apps for tablets (The fact the tablet section in PlayStore has basically 5 MORE apps than ALL of Windows 10 app availability is offensive this far along in Android.) Rod I'd add in standby battery drain in there, too. Rod Does this mean Android phones won't be embarrassed at PhoneBuff speed tests anymore? Yay! Maxwell “Max” Weinbach if you do the Pixel vs the iPhone 7, i think the pixel would win. A nexus 6p vs S8, the nexus wins. Roh_Mish Would love this on my XZ. It is a solid performer but my god does it take its own sweet time booting up. Lars Jeppesen Why do you boot your device? Keep it alive, dawg.. Roh_Mish Mostly because sometimes due to really heavy use i drain my battery and it shuts down by night. Before 7.1 i had it get really laggy and i had to reboot. Сергей Бугаев They did mention some details about how they accomplished this, for example concurrent garbage collection and heap defragmentation, but we'll hear more in the dedicated ART news session. Cakefish Yay. This is great stuff. abc I'll believe it when I see it. Denholm Willmer My Pixel XL is consistently booting up in under 5 seconds with this update JD Nice, now they can join the iPhone and S6 since 2015 create812 I must say, my phone reboots super quick now. just1box "Now reboots 2x as fast!" wtf? Well shuck the corn and light the barn fires! Since rebooting IS THE ABSOLUTE LEAST FREQUENT ACTIVITY, assigning development to speed it up seems like THE LAMEST waste of talent/time. Clearly, the Android team has NOTHING else important to tackle. Reboot 2x as fast TF!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: Google Is Making Its Biggest Push Yet Into Augmented Reality The search giant is skipping the recreational use cases in favor of functional ones. Evan Niu, CFA (TMFNewCow) May 18, 2017 at 10:38PM Forget goofy video filters -- Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is skipping all that in favor of a more functional approach. Snap's meteoric rise in popularity has been driven largely by its live video filters, or Lenses, that overlay various types of visual effects in real time. These are but one of many features that larger rival Facebook has replicated, recently launching a Camera Effects Platform as its big push into augmented reality (AR) that will complement its concurrent efforts to expand virtual reality (VR). Heck, even Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is getting in on the fun with its recent Clips app. It goes without saying that live video filters only appeal to a modest subset of users, while AR-based search has incredible potential for mainstream functionalities. Image source: Getty Images. Enter Google Lens Of all the things that the search giant announced at its I/O developer conference opening keynote this week, Google Lens is easily the most impressive. With Google Lens, your smartphone camera won't just see what you see, but will also understand what you see to help you take action. #io17 pic.twitter.com/viOmWFjqk1 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google Lens will leverage its ongoing advances in machine learning and neural nets and be able to identify objects, and then deliver actionable information based on what it sees. Examples include identifying a flower species, looking up restaurant reviews, real-time language translation, and more. The technology will first make its way to Google Photos later this year, and will subsequently be integrated into Google Assistant, as well. Google Lens. Image source: Google. Google Lens is very much the spiritual successor to Google Goggles, which the search giant launched way back in 2010 with mostly the same purpose: using your smartphone camera to search for things. Google discontinued Goggles in 2014 since it wasn't really being used. However, computer vision technology has come a long way since then, as has awareness of AR as a technology and its potential. This is what the AR market needs Strategically, it makes a lot more sense to approach AR from a functional standpoint than a recreational one. Using Google Lens as a visual search tool that can provide information to mainstream consumers fits perfectly within Google's broader mission, and that's exactly what the AR market needs right now: a compelling mainstream use case. That's especially true if AR hopes for a shot at becoming the next major computing platform. For most of the other companies, AR-based video filters are just a starting point for broader AR ambitions. It's not as if Clips helps Apple sell more iPhones, but mainstream AR functions might if included in future iPhones. It should be obvious that Apple has grand plans for AR that will include more functional applications; when we see those plans is another matter altogether.

Major record labels are preparing to hit back at a Google-funded report that touts the value of YouTube to the music industry, ridiculing the report’s conclusion that YouTube boosts business for artists and their labels by giving them better exposure. The beef is escalating as music labels are mounting legal challenges here and in Europe against so-called “safe harbor” provisions in copyright laws that don’t hold Web-based platforms like YouTube liable for infringing content that’s posted by third parties on their sites. In YouTube’s defense, its owner, Google, backed a 104-page study from UK-based consultant RBB Economics called “Value of YouTube to the Music Industry.” The report, obtained by The Post on Thursday, claims that without YouTube, 85 percent of its users would be headed to lower-paying services. “It’s hard to even understand which services are even available that pay less than that,” said one music source. Top-level music sources say the remaining 15 percent of YouTube users are hugely valuable because there are so many of them. Even that small slice of YouTube users headed to paid service would be three times more beneficial to music industry coffers than the current percentage of ad revenue and per-stream rate of 3 cents, according to one source. “It’s an incredibly flawed report,” said the source. “They destabilize the marketplace, it’s a free on-demand music service, and there is no ability to license it.” According to the RBB report, paid streaming music services have continued to grow alongside YouTube. The report says that YouTube is aiding the music industry by helping promote sales rather than hindering them. The report also states that YouTube has generated $1 billion in revenue for the music labels. YouTube. which is led by CEO Susan Wojcicki, is projected to reach $7.05 billion in ad revenue in 2017, a 26 percent jump, according to eMarketer data. YouTube has 185.9 million monthly users in the US, the company said. Universal Music and Sony Music want YouTube to pay higher rates that are more akin to what paid streaming services such as Spotify and Apple cough up. International music organization IFPI says paid streamers paid up $3.9 billion to the music labels in 2016 on just 212 million users. “In other words, the very premise of the analysis is all wrong,” said a spokesman for the Recording Industry Association of America. “The issue is about fair compensation, not about whether YouTube should exist or no longer offer music.” Meanwhile, earlier this month Warner Music signed a deal to license content to YouTube, infuriating other labels. “We secured the best possible deals under very difficult circumstances,” Warner Music CEO Stephen Cooper said. “Our new deals are also shorter than usual, giving us more options in the future.” A YouTube spokeswoman said labels “can easily decide whether to have fan-uploaded content taken down, or profit from it on YouTube” through a copyright claims system that has paid out $2 billion to rights holders thus far.

Banking malware targeting mobile users requires little tech know-how to develop and operate, so it stands as an insistent battle for security professionals. Banking malware campaigns siphon out financial data and hijack funds to the intruders' accounts – and all the various defences put in place to thwart their efforts have proven inadequate, says a new post from the Check Point Mobile Research Team. And now, the scourge is exacerbated with the use of an ever-expanding malware-as-a-service business model and open sourced code, the study found. The simplicity of the tools and strategy is encouraging wannabe criminals to enter the fray. All it takes is malware that can detect a banking app on an infected device and then, once a user opens it, launch a phony overlay page. Once the unwitting device owner enters their credentials, the valuable data is sent directly to the attacker's server, the report explained. After witnessing three major developments in the mobile banking malware arena in the past few months, the Check Point researchers joined with ElevenPaths, Telefónica Cyber Security Unit, and its Tacyt mobile cyber-intelligence tool to investigate further. What they detected was that banking malware had managed to increase distribution by getting a foothold in Google Play, Google's official app store. The team also found that a number of banking variants sprung up subsequent to an open source malware being posted on a malware developer forum. As well, the team discovered new capabilities the malware was putting to use. The good news: the team was able to decipher the operation. The major development here is that while in the past banker malware was spread mainly through third-party app stores or by phishing campaigns, embedding it within Google Play greatly enhances its spread – even though it now requires getting around Google defences. To achieve this, the new breed of banking malware managed to obfuscate the malicious parts of its code, the report found. "The main difference seen between the samples we've tested is the obfuscation techniques used, which refers to the way the attackers hide the malicious code by encrypting and encoding it," Daniel Padon, mobile threat researcher at Check Point, said. "There are dozens of encryption protocols and various practices in which they are implemented, resulting in endless paths to reach the same goal." Since the code, which conducts the malicious activity is all borrowed from the same source, it makes sense for the attackers to only hide it in a better way, he added.   The Check Point team of researchers found a malware forum on which Maza-in, a known malware creator, detailed how to create and setup a banker malware. The discussion also provided source code of Android apps and the necessary backend (PHP and database). "This enables inexperienced malware developers to create not only a Command & Control system for Android, but a fully operational banking Trojan," the report stated. "All they have left to do is create a fake overlay page of the targeted bank and establish a Command & Control server." The researchers gained access to a number of C&C servers where they detected 33 banking apps from France, Germany, Russia and Turkey. These apps are able to disable two-factor authentication, which is used by banks to authenticate users. So, the attackers are primed to defraud the banks, credit card companies and the people accessing them with their mobile devices. Plus, the attackers' tactics have evolved with anti-virus detection, the study found. The latest malware checks for AV on a device. If it detects any of 13 different AV tools, to avoid detection it will not launch. However, the Check Point team found that despite being guarded by some of these AV tools, the malware was still present on some devices. When asked what is so different about the delivery mechanism used in this banking malware, Padon said the main difference is that this time the malware managed to infiltrate Google Play in several separate instances, reaching a much larger audience than they could achieve otherwise. "This is worrying since unlike most malware found on Google Play, bankers are purely malicious and directly harm the unprotected users." Further, hackers that manage to sneak their malware into Google Play are bound to be high-level coders, Padon pointed out. "This proves once again that users cannot rely on the official app stores for their safety, and must use additional protections, just as they do on their personal computers."   The study concludes: "Mobile bankers are on the rise, managing to bypass the defences created by the Android OS, banks, Google Play, and now even by common AVs." And, the tools are being used not only by script kiddies and more advanced threat actors, but by state actors, as evidenced by the leak of Vault 7, the report stated. To avoid these ploys, Check Point advised users to implement advanced protections capable of dynamic analysis. This strategy detects and blocks malicious actions even when code is obfuscated, they said. There also is a bit of good news for iPhone users. Padon said that Check Point has yet to detect any mobile banking malware hitting Apple's system.

Android O will be rolling out to the general public later this summer, but the second developer preview is out now. It's also the first public beta of the OS, so if you've got a recent Nexus or Pixel device and want to try it out, now's your chance – just head to android.com/beta to sign up. As with all Android updates, we're expecting this one to come to the company's first-party Pixel and Nexus devices first, followed by devices from other manufacturers. However, the company's new 'Project Treble' initiative (see below) should mean that fans without a Google-made device won't have to wait as long to get it as with previous versions. Project Treble Google has announced that one of the upcoming OS' key features will be a significant change to the software's underlying architecture, dubbed Project Treble. This will make it substantially easier for OEMs and device manufacturers to push the latest patches out to their products. "One thing we've consistently heard from our device-maker partners is that updating existing devices to a new version of Android is incredibly time consuming and costly," the Android Developers Blog said. "With Project Treble, we're re-architecting Android to make it easier, faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to a new version of Android." Project Treble will cut out some of the steps involved in the release process of Android patches, which have to be created by Google, modified by manufacturing partners and then further customised by actual device-makers before ending up on users' phones. The change will ensure customers get the latest Android features faster, as well as being able to more quickly plug security holes. The slow speed of updates currently means that many devices can be left vulnerable for months (if not longer) while they wait for a fix to be rolled out. Project Treble is currently included in the Android O developer preview and will be rolling out as part of the OS' general release. Android O name The official name for the next release of the OS is Android 8 but it's known as Android O. Google follows a longstanding tradition of naming each successive version of the OS after some form of "sweet treat" which follow an alphabetical order. Past updates include names such as Jellybean, KitKat, Marshmallow and Nougat. There is no definite answer to what the "O" stands for in the name of the update but there have been guesses made such as Orange, Oatmeal and Oreo. Or maybe it's the shape of a tasty treat and is in fact a doughnut?  Android O top features Google has finally given fans their first official look at Android O, showing off the forthcoming update at the Google I/O developer's conference at their Mountain View headquarters. However, anyone expecting a substantial overhaul of the OS is going to be disappointed. Most of the show was given over to the company's advanced in machine learning and AI technology, with comparatively little time devoted to Android itself. What scant updates the company did announce were spread across two separate areas: 'vitals', which cover Android's internal processes and functions, and 'fluid experiences', which relates to visible features like the UI and settings. Picture-in-Picture video In the latter category, Google has finally introduced picture-in-picture video to Android. If you're making a video call in Duo or watching a video in YouTube, pressing the home button will bring you back to the home screen, with a minimised window in the right hand corner displaying the video. In practise, it works very similarly to the way picture-in-picture videos are displayed within YouTube's mobile app, although this is system-wide and compatible with multiple different apps. Notifications The notification system has also been slightly tweaked, with new iOS-style 'notification dots'. If you have unread notifications within an app, a dot will be displayed in the corner of its home screen icon, which you can long-press on to see a pop-up widget giving you more details on the content. This feature should require no extra effort for devs to enable – Android will even change the dot's colour automatically depending on your icon's design, ensuring it doesn't spoil your colour scheme. Android O is introducing notification channels, too. These are new app-defined categories for notification content. Channels allow users to have extra control over different types of notifications so they can block or change the behaviour of each channel individually instead of managing all of the app's notifications together. There are also new visuals and grouping of notifications that make it easier for users to see what's going on when viewing their notifications. Autofill and Smart Text Selection A couple of less impressive (but arguably more useful) features were debuted, too – autofill and smart text selection. The former extends Chrome's built-in autocomplete function to Android, meaning that when you set up a new phone, Android will automatically fill in your account details for apps. It's currently unknown if this feature will allow you to use different credential storage services like Lastpass or Dashlane, however. Android's new smart text selection is another useful feature. It uses machine learning to identify multi-part phrases that are commonly highlighted together, like phone numbers, addresses and business names, meaning users just have to double-tap on one word to highlight the whole thing. It even brings up a shortcut for the app it thinks would be most relevant, like Maps or the phone dialler. Performance and battery life upgrades Moving on to 'vitals', the updates that govern Android's internal systems, there are modifications to performance and battery life, including changes to the runtime that result in app performance and boot times that are up to twice as past as previous versions. In addition, new limits have been placed on the way apps operate in the background, making sure that they don't use too much of the device's memory or battery power when not in active use. Security Security has also been shored up. The Google Play Store has historically been known to host malware, scams and other bogus applications, but the new Google Play Protect service is set to put a stop to that, scanning apps that you want to download for malware and other threats, as well as those already on your device. The service also incorporates Android's other security features such as remote locking and wiping of devices. Google Play Console dashboards It's not just the device software that's been updated; Android's developer tools have been tuned up too. The Play Console now has six new dashboards to help devs track common issues, including frozen frames, excessive crash rate, slow rendering, ANR rate, stuck wake locks and excessive wakeups. The dashboards include breakdowns of how many users are affected, as well as tips for resolving the problems. Android Studio 3.0 Google unveiled the third version of Android Studio, the company's IDE for mobile development. Amidst a laundry list of changes and updates, the biggest news is the addition of in-depth profiling tools for real-time visualisation and troubleshooting, new Java 8 Language support and support for the Kotlin programming language, which is fully interoperable with existing Android code, and can be deployed immediately. Font resources in XML Fonts are now fully supported in Android O. Apps are able to use fonts in XML layouts and define font families in XML too - defining the font style, weight and font files. Adaptive icons Developers can now create adaptive icons which the system displays in different shapes, based on a mask selected by the device. The system can also animate interactions with the icons, and uses them in the launcher, settings, sharing dialogs, and in the overview screen. Wide-gamut colour for apps Developers of imaging apps can now take advantage of devices that have a wide-gamut colour capable display. Connectivity Android O supports high-quality Bluetooth audio codecs such as LDAC codec. There will be new Wi-Fi features such as Wi-Fi Aware, previously known as Neighbour Awareness Networking (NAN), which allows devices to connect directly to each other via Wi-Fi Aware without any other type of connectivity between them, such as Wi-Fi Access Point or Cellular. Keyboard navigation Google has seen a resurgence of keyboard navigation within the apps so are building a more reliable and predictable model for "arrow" and "tab" navigation for developers and users. AAudio API for Pro Audio AAudio is a new native API for apps that require high-performance, low-latency audio. Developer preview has an early version of this as Google are looking for feedback.

The assistant will just pull the necessary data from various services in the cloud.PHOTO: REUTERS Published4 hours ago More Share Tweet Linkedin Pin Google+ Reddit Print Permalink: http://str.sg/4uoA Copy Leonid Bershidsky (Bloomberg View) - For years, mobile phone owners have had access to just one digital assistant - Siri on an iPhone, Google Now/Google Assistant on an Android device, Cortana on a Windows one. Now that's changing as multiple assistants proliferate to multiple phones. It sounds like an epidemic case of multiple personality disorder, but it's actually a step towards a future in which the artificially intelligent entities will take over our gadgets and make them more powerful and easier to use. Google Assistant, the unimaginatively named software that pops up on Android phones when you say "OK Google", is now available for iPhones. You can't ask it to take a selfie or perform some other tasks - Apple keeps that functionality for its own Siri - but you are free to enjoy its superior speech-recognition technology. With some technical skill, you can also run Google Assistant on Windows systems alongside the native digital assistant, Cortana (which, in turn, has been available on Android and iOS for a while). Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Since millions of people are using Alexa, the helpful voice inside the Echo speaker, smartphone maker HTC's new flagship phone, the U11, responds to both "OK Google" and "Alexa!" Samsung's Galaxy S8, for its part, includes both Google Assistant and the Korean company's own Bixby. In other words, the digital assistants are getting untethered from makers and even operating systems. Soon, they will supersede them: The assistant becomes the primary interface, and the user doesn't really care about what's under the hood unless he or she is a determined geek. But that shift is predicated on improvements to voice interaction technology that have eluded developers so far. Whatever the makers of these systems claim about their voice recognition technology, it's highly imperfect - there are lots of funny examples on Reddit's r/SiriFail. So Google is adding keyboard input support to Assistant, and camera support will also come soon, the company announced at its developer conference (now under way). That means we'll be able to train the phone's camera on a flower or a building, and it'll tell us what it is, or translate text from a foreign language without a special app.  The idea is that the digital assistant will do all the work for the user. If you want to post to Facebook, for example, you won't need to open the app - the assistant will give you a window to do it; if you're trying to figure out if the restaurant in front of you is worth entering, you won't need to google it or bring up the Yelp app, just train the camera on the sign and the assistant will give you all the relevant information.  The benefits for the user are obvious. Eventually, it may become unnecessary to install apps on a phone - the assistant will just pull the necessary data from various services in the cloud. Digital assistant developers, for their part, can point users toward their own services, something vitally important for Google and Amazon but also helpful for Microsoft and Apple. Sure, that will probably prompt antitrust complaints, but regulators are taking years to consider such cases even with more easy-to-understand technology. In 2010, the European Commission started its investigation of how Google allegedly prioritises its own shopping comparison service in search results; the case is still dragging on. By the time it's over, new technology will be in place that may take watchdogs another decade to parse, and since the assistants are powered by artificial intelligence, developers will have a new defense: These algorithms have a life of their own, and it won't always be possible to completely control their choices. Now, people hardly ever use the digital assistants on desktop and laptop computers, very often on home speakers and not that frequently on phones. Talking to a gadget when you're not driving a car remains a turn-off for many people (and for me, definitely). Only 18 per cent of smartphone users call up the assistants daily. The speakers, however, will be niche products for a long time. Not everyone can think of a use for them. Phones, however, are ubiquitous - and suddenly the whole market is up for grabs for the company that develops the perfect digital assistant and makes it the interface of choice. That's why Samsung, for example, believes it can get in the game - and why Amazon is already in it. The mission is far from trivial. Artificial intelligence needs training to get better, and that means more interactions with humans. Companies need to entice customers to use highly imperfect products. That takes a lot of hype and some quick improvement, otherwise disappointed phone users will drift away. Google and Amazon appear to be the most determined developers at this point, but there's still time (not that much) for Apple and Microsoft to catch up.   In the end, getting the digital assistants to take over our gadgets is a collaborative effort between developers, users and machine-learning algorithms. It's not quite clear yet if a complete takeover is even possible; that depends on whether the algorithms ever get as good at giving us what we want as we are at getting it manually (an increasingly relative term). But given the enormous resources being invested into this play, it's likely to bring about change in the way we use our communication devices even if it doesn't succeed 100 per cent.

Adam Turner Follow on Google Plus Follow on Twitter 23 reading now Show comments facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More When it arrives mid-year, talking to Google's attentive benchtop speaker will be more about striking up a conversation than simply issuing commands. Google's pint-sized smart speaker is finally coming to Australia, designed to sit on your kitchen bench, coffee table or bedside table so it's always at your beck and call. It's completely hands-free, relying on the AI-powered Google Assistant; just say "Okay Google" to get its attention and then tell it what you need. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The talkative Google Home smart benchtop speaker is vying for a place in Australian homes.  Google Home is going to cost more than $200 in Australia so you really need a good use for it once the novelty wears off, just as you might have grown weary of taunting the talkative assistant on your smartphone. The developers of Google Home and Google Assistant say that the four main uses people find for the smart speaker are answering queries, playing music, managing your schedule and controlling your smart home devices. If you'd tick at least two of those boxes then you might consider Google Home good value, especially when you consider that 'answering queries' extends to services which are connected to Google such as flight times and traffic reports. Listen closely Google Assistant's strengths compared to other interactive voice assistants are its power to comprehend natural language rather than just keywords and its ability to remember context from your previous question. As a testament to its abilities, Google says around 70 per cent of voice interactions are natural language rather than users barking orders, because they trust it to understand them. Advertisement This means you can ask "Who is the Prime Minister of Canada?" followed by "How tall is he?" and Google Assistant knows that you're still talking about Justin Trudeau. Apple's Siri is making progress in this department but there's work to be done; ask Siri the second question and she replies "Okay, I found this on the web for "How tall is Canada". So when you get past the fun and games, where would you put Google Home to work? To me it makes the most sense in the kitchen. It's the place where you're most likely to have your hands full making it inconvenient to reach for your phone, whether you're making school lunches or cooking dinner. Google is adding the ability to set timers, alarms and reminders via Google Home, which will certainly make it more useful in a busy kitchen. The kitchen is also a room which is less likely to have a decent speaker compared to the living areas of your home, so Google Home is handy if you like to listen to music while you cook – controlling your music hands-free. Time to shop Considering all this, it's interesting that shopping didn't get a mention in that list of top uses from Google's developers, even though Google Home works with Google Shopping Express in the US (unfortunately it isn't available in Australia). If you envision yourself standing in front of your open pantry and dictating a shopping list or even ordering items directly, then Amazon's Echo smart speaker might be a better fit in your kitchen. It's not available in Australia yet but it's certainly on the cards considering that Amazon intends to finally get serious about Australian retail this year.  That said, Google insists it's working hard to forge partnerships with Australian providers before it launches, which will include retailers. You'll likely be able to order a pizza with your voice, rather than opening a separate app on your phone, and it's possible that local supermarkets could also get in on the act. A matter of trust This brings us to my key concern about Google Home living in my kitchen; the thought of my children discovering that pizza is only an "Okay Google" away. In the US, Google Home can distinguish between different voices but this feature has been slow to roll out globally and Google can't confirm whether it will be available at launch in Australia. Meanwhile all voices are treated equally and perhaps it would benefit from a fingerprint reader to confirm some requests, unless you opt to disable this extra security measure. Once Google Home knows exactly who you are, it becomes a lot more practical to ask "what's on my calendar today?" Even when multi-user support eventually comes to Australia, Google assumes that every user is at least 13 years old so it doesn't offer a lot in terms of granular parental controls. This means you'll need to dive into your children's advanced Google account settings if you want to ensure that Google Home doesn't become a bottomless vending machine or start answering awkward questions like "where do babies come from?" It'll take some trial and error, with a few awkward moments along the way, to figure out exactly how Google Home fits into your life. What would you use it for?

Google CEO, Sundar Pichai announced a new service called “Google for Jobs”that runs within the company Google Search and uses machine learning to search and categorise all types of jobs. Pichai gave the hundreds of developers attending the event a brief preview of the search engine and how it uses machine learning to find and segregate not just high-end professional jobs but also service industry and entry-level postings. Google’s thinking behind its new search offering is to simply connect job seekers to the best and closest openings by employers that should also help employers find the right candidates faster. The process will be a bit slow and in a few weeks from now, Google will begin to recognize when users in the US search for jobs in Google Search by typing job queries. At the moment, Pichai said that Google is working with traditional job search providers like LinkedIn, Monster and others and provide users with a number of tools to help users filter out their search results by title, category, date posted and even whether its full or part-time. Additionally, job seekers will also get an idea about the commute times to their potential workplace, which should also help them decide whether they should go in for it to begin with. So where do the machine learning bits come in? Well, Google is using machine learning to understand how one job title would be related to other or a particular industry, that should help in clustering them together. So if a user is looking for jobs in “retail”, he/she will find “retail associate” or “store clerk” or “store manager” upon typing the query. The move is simple, yet effective and takes on a task with little risk involved for Google. Once you are done with your job search, there will also be a simple one-click “Apply” to submit your application.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see.

Last year Google ran through a range of different categories from Best Game to Going Global, and this year Google will be listing off the winners for all new categories along with returning categories like those listed above in addition to Best App, Best Families App, and others. Developers work hard all year to bring users the most intuitive, most fun, and most innovative apps and games and Google is giving a little bit back by shining the spotlight on those that stood out the most. Standout Indie Indie games hold a special place in the hearts of many gamers, and not just because some of the content that comes out of indie studios is breathtaking, but also because they tend to showcase what can really be done with even a small team of dedicated individuals. The winner for this year’s Standout Indie app is actually a game called Mushroom 11, a recently released puzzle title that features some pretty awesome visuals and intensely imaginative landscapes. The runners up include Causality, Kingdom: New Lands, Reigns, and Mars: Mars. Google play Standout Startup As the name of this category suggests the apps in this particular category are all coming out of startups, which not unlike Indie studios can have smaller teams, though not always. Starting a business cane be an especially challenging task and taking that risk to launch a startup deserves some recognition in itself, but even more so when you use that startup to create an app that seeks to offer something unique and engaging. The winner of Standout Startup is Hooked, an app which offers users a collection of thrilling “edge-of-your-seat” stories that are all told through the medium of chat. It’s a fresh idea that actually caught on and has grown to include a massive number of users. The runners up for this category are Discord, Simple Habit, CastBox, and Digit. Google play Best Android Wear Experience Android Wear has grown into a bustling platform for wearables especially since the launch of Android Wear 2.0 which brought a handful of nice improvements. That said the platform is still growing and has plenty of room to grow too, but there are still some awesome apps which are already available for the platform that are getting daily use. The winner for Best Android Wear Experience is Runtastic Running & Fitness, which lets users do anything from track their runs to their calories burned, their distance and pace, and even get audio feedback from a voice coach to keep you motivated. The Runners up for this category are Lifesum, Bring!, and Foursquare. Google play Best TV Experience As Android TV continues to evolve and add new and exciting features, so to does the library of Android TV native applications that offer awesome content for those who have a compatible device that runs the platform. The winner for Best TV Experience is Redbull TV. While a big portion of it will be filled with videos of action-related sports, there’s also coverage of events, music, and sports too, and what better way to watch this exciting content than on the big screen where pictures are vibrant and well… large. The runners up for this category are Netflix, Haystack TV, AbemaTV, and KKBOX. Google play Best VR Experience While VR has been around for more than just the past six months to a year, Google’s first VR headset (not counting Cardboard) didn’t release until the Fall of 2016. Since then there have been a number of apps and games that have been pushed out for Daydream and many of them are quite good, pulling the user into their worlds and immersing them in some of the most captivating universes out there. The winner of Best VR Experience is Virtual Virtual Reality, a game which tasks the player with trying to escape the future of an A.I.-driven world where everything is automated and humans are sort of obsolete when it comes to jobs. It lets you put on a VR headset in virtual reality, so you’re essentially diving into VR while already in VR, and you can do all sorts of crazy things. The runners up for this category are, The Arcslinger, Gunjack 2: End Of Shift, Mekorama VR, and The Turning Forest. Google play Best AR Experience Much like virtual reality, augmented reality is capable of some pretty amazing things too, as it blends the real world around us with the digital world that we usually hold in our hands. The winner for Best AR Experience is Woorld, a sandbox game which lets you play with digital toys in the real world while interacting with all kinds of fun characters and other digital objects. The runners up for this category are Crayola Color Blaster, Holo, WayfairView, and Dinosaurs Among Us. Google play Best App For Kids Kids are the future so why not help that along by giving them something to play with that is not only fun but also engaging, and seeks to foster their creativity in a number of ways. All of the apps in this category do a great job at getting kids to explore and tap into their inspiration, while also being fun and keeping them entertained. The winner for Best App For Kids is Animal Jam – Play Wild!, a casual game that lets kids explore a huge 3D world while taking on the persona of a number of different animals to represent them as their avatar. The game can teach them about real animals and the habitats they live in, while also letting them complete fun quests and chat with other players. The runners up for this category are Hot Wheels: Race Off, Teeny Titans, Toca Life: Vacation, and Think! Think!. Google play Best Multiplayer Game Multiplayer games can feel like the centerpiece of gaming as it does something that single-players games can’t, it brings people together and lets them all enjoy some wonderful content whether just for a few minutes or a few hours. The winner for Best Multiplayer Game is Hearthstone, Blizzard Entertainment’s wildly popular card battler that takes its inspirations, themes, characters, and really all of the content from the World of Warcraft universe. While you can play Hearthstone by yourself, it hinges mostly on competitive play against others to see who can best their opponent in a heated battle by laying down cards on the board to deplete their opponents health to 0, each card having a unique effect. The runners up for this category are Dawn of Titans, Fifa Mobile, Lords Mobile, and Modern Strike Online. Google play Best App Apps come and go and there are plenty of them on Android, so it should come as no surprise that there was going to be another Best App category this year. The winner for Best App is Memrise, a language learning application that offers a collection of free learning courses in a vast amount of different languages from Japanese to Russian. It makes learning a new language easier than you would think it could be, and it does so while keeping things fun and sort of game like, while also offering users the ability to upgrade to higher levels of difficulty for their chosen language to help them become more proficient in it. The runners up for this category are Money Lover, Quik, Citymapper,  and Fabulous. Google play Best Game Like best app, Best Game was a category that was available last year and just like then, it seeks to highlight the best of the best in the Android game department. There are lots of great games out there for Android, but these are the ones that have stood out the most, and the winner for Best Game is Transformers: Forged To Fight. This game lets you dive into the action as some of your favorite Transformers robots and engage in team battles, collect loot, and even set up bases you need to defend from your enemies. The runners up for this category are Fire Emblem: Heroes, Pokémon GO, Lineage 2 Revolution, and Choices. Google play Best Accessibility Experience This is a new category for this year and it’s one that attempts to highlight apps which make it easier for people to do things like communicate with others to just making things simple and more automated and convenient. The winner for Best Accessibility Experience is IFTTT, which basically lets you automate all sorts of tasks by creating things called applets. IFTTT can be used on your smartphone, but it can also integrate with smart home products to help automate all kinds of stuff like turning on and off lights. The runners up for this category are Open Sesame!, Swiftkey Symbols, A Blind Legend, and Eye-D. Google play Best Social Impact Another new category for this year, Best Social Impact is highlighting apps which are making a pretty big difference on users at a global scale. The winner of Best Social Impact is an app called ShareTheMeal, which is an app that was designed and launched as a means for helping fight the issue of global hunger that kids across the world face each and every day. It’s a charity app that allows use to help fund feeding children with the tap of a button, and you can see where your donations are headed and even learn more about World Hunger. The runners up for this category are Charity Miles, Peek Acuity, ProDeaf, and Sea Hero Quest.

Make Save Borrow Grow Live More Deals Need Help Finding the Perfect Job? Just Ask Google Karla Bowsher May 18, 2017 Photo by FabrikaSimf / Shutterstock.com Need Help Finding the Perfect Job? Just Ask Google 0 The king of search engines hopes to help you find your next job. Google wants to better match job seekers to job openings and better connect hiring companies with potential employees. This effort is part of an initiative called Google for Jobs. Google CEO Sundar Pichai explained in a blog post Wednesday: “… almost half of U.S. employers say they still have issues filling open positions. Meanwhile, job seekers often don’t know there’s a job opening just around the corner from them, because the nature of job posts — high turnover, low traffic, inconsistency in job titles — have made them hard for search engines to classify.” So in the coming week, Google will launch a new feature for its search engine. The feature “helps people look for jobs across experience and wage levels — including jobs that have traditionally been much harder to search for and classify, like service and retail jobs,” according to Pichai. He also announced the new search feature Wednesday during his keynote address at Google’s annual Google I/O conference for software developers, USA Today reports. Pichai told attendees that “the challenge of connecting job seekers to better information on job availability is like many search challenges we’ve solved in the past.” Google’s new job search feature will scour the web for job listings, pulling them from a variety of sources, including job websites like Glassdoor and ZipRecruiter and social media networks like Facebook and LinkedIn, according to USA Today. Then, job openings that match a job seeker’s search will appear at the top of search results. Job seekers can narrow the results by applying filters, such as a filter that restricts search results to listings for entry-level jobs or full-time jobs. Once job seekers find a job listing, they will be taken to the website where the job is posted so they can apply for it. Of course, finding and applying for a job are but the first two steps to landing a new gig. Even before you apply, you should research the hiring company and the position and ensure your application and resume reflect that you did your homework and you fit the position.

Smith Helaine Kang Highlights Energy Mining Tech Pharma & Biotech Home News Newswires ASX:DTS Dragontail Systems expands into fleet management solution Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version 14:00 19 May 2017 The new solution is expected to gain significant market traction. Dragontail’s Algo Dispatching Systems leverages Google Maps Dragontail Systems (ASX:DTS) has signed an agreement with Israel-based fuel and fleet management business Roseman Engineering, to integrate Dragontail’s tracking capabilities into the Roseman system. Roseman was introduced to Dragontail by the Google Maps specialist partner GoGIS. Dragontail’s Algo Dispatching Systems will leverage Google Maps and other services to provide machine learning, versatile navigation and tracking optimisation algorithm. As a result of the agreement, customers using the Roseman solution will be able to easily track vehicle availability and ensure compliance with regulation and with fleet manager rules. The new solution is expected to gain significant market traction given the compelling benefits of the integrated system. Importantly, the integration demonstrates Dragontail solutions’ versatility to track deliveries in various markets, based on leading-edge Google technologies. The lucrative global fleet management market is expected to be worth US$27.9 billion by 2021.

The Algo System optimises and manages large and complex kitchen operations. The system’s ability to manage large volumes of orders, food preparation tasks and delivery data makes it well suited to the hotel and resort industries where It has a number of potential uses.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on.

Picture taken May 9, 2017. REUTERS/Bobby Yip 3/3 By Sijia Jiang | HONG KONG HONG KONG In a cluster of refurbished Mao-era industrial buildings in Guangzhou, developers at China's top messaging app, WeChat, are redesigning key parts of its product to spread its tentacles to just about every aspect of Chinese life. Around 1,500 developers, mainly twentysomething males, have been tasked with increasing user engagement through new 'mini-programs' on WeChat that look and operate much like apps on Apple Inc's iOS and Google's Android operating systems - but are far less data-intensive. WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, says it's not a direct challenge to the dominant mobile platforms, but some analysts and developers say the new business could eat into that of iOS and Android app ecosystems. "In the long-term, the relationship between Tencent and Apple's ecosystems will be co-existence and 'co-opetition' - intense competition in some areas and time periods, coupled with some form of cooperation in others," said Su Ning, professor of Information Systems at Ivey Business School in Canada. With more than 938 million users, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. Half the users spend more than 90 minutes a day on its chat app, according to WeChat. WeChat's push on these nimble mini-apps comes as Google this week launched its own Android Instant Apps, which don't require downloading and are available on certain Android devices, though access to Google products in China is heavily restricted. WeChat says there are about 200,000 third-party developers for the WeChat platform. "A very strong trend in China is that demand for iOS and Android apps is waning, while that for program developing based on WeChat is rising," said Leon Du, co-founder of Guangzhou-based Beansmile, a digital consultancy that develops apps and websites. Helped by WeChat-based advertising and payment-related services, Tencent this week reported its highest profit growth in three years for the first quarter. [nL4N1IJ36T] While Tencent doesn't release data on the number of mini-programs available, Dong Xu, a manager at market data firm Analysys, says her interviews with businesses suggest the adoption rate has so far been modest. "Mini-programs are mainly used for low-frequency, offline scenarios, such as fee payments, parking, and customer inquiries," Dong said. "Users' in-depth needs such as entertainment and e-commerce still take place with apps." Third-party developers say the mini-programs, built in WeChat's proprietary programming language, are less data-heavy and easier to develop than their iOS or Android counterparts. Users, for example, can tap a program on a restaurant's official WeChat account to order food, have it delivered to their table and pay for it, all in one app. WeChat also last month quietly established a new department dedicated to online searching, and this week rolled out a beta search-engine box with enhanced power, revealing its ambition to take on rival Baidu Inc. PAY WARS Central to its plans for an expansive and dynamic app ecosystem is the development of WeChat's own payment infrastructure. Around 300 developers work for WeChat Pay, which competes with Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and to a lesser extent, Apple Pay, which launched in China last year. TenPay, which runs WeChat Pay and Tencent's smaller QQ Wallet, is China's most popular mobile payment provider by users, with 838 million users dwarfing Alipay's 432 million, according to Analysys. At a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday, Tencent President Martin Lau flagged WeChat Pay's goal to permeate all aspects of consumer life in China. For Apple, which wants to deepen its reach in China, the world's biggest mobile spender, WeChat's large and loyal fan base and its payment service present a challenge. China overtook the United States as the biggest contributor to Apple's iOS app store revenue last year, according to mobile data analytics firm App Annie. [nL4N1I52KU] However, Apple's Greater China revenue dropped 14 percent in the first three months of the year, as cheaper rivals chipped away at sales. [nL4N1I44PN] Apple declined to comment for this article. Last month, some Chinese WeChat fans threatened to ditch Apple products after the U.S. firm forced the chat app to abolish a popular tipping function. While building user loyalty is a core part of both Apple's and WeChat's strategies, Zhang Ying, general manager of WeChat Pay, has downplayed product tensions from the tipping spat. "Apple is still supportive of the [WeChat] ecosystem. We are part of the [Apple] ecosystem," he told a forum in Hong Kong last month. "It is far from a 'choose-one-or-another' - it's merely some disagreement."

Google's first-gen Tensor processors were already 15-30x more powerful, and a huge 30-80x more power efficient than CPUs and GPUs for these types of workloads.   These new TPUs are "optimized for both workloads, allowing the same chips to be used for both training and making inferences. Each card has its own high-speed interconnects, and 64 of the cards can be linked into what Google calls a pod, with 11.5 petaflops total; one petaflops is 1015 floating point operations per second", reports Ars Technica.     Ars Technica points out that making comparisons between machine learning solutions is "difficult", because most GPUs have their performance measured with single precision FLOPs, which are based on 32-bit numbers. The GPUs can work with double precision (64-bit numbers), and half precision mode (16-bit). Machine learning workloads normally work on half precision when they can, but the first-gen TPUs from Google didn't use floating point at all, they used 8-bit interger approximations to floating point.   For comparisons sake, AMD's new Radeon Vega Frontier Edition has an estimated 13 TFLOPs of single precision compute performance, and 25 TFLOPs of half precision compute performance. NVIDIA's beefty new Volta-based Tesla V100 graphics solution packs 15 TFLOPs of single precision, and 120 TFLOPs for "deep learning" workloads.

And on day one, they’ve already shared some pretty impressive new options – here’s an overview of all the major announcements from I/O thus far, from a digital marketing perspective. Google Lens Pinterest recently launched their innovative Lens tool which enables users to search Pins based on images taken with their phone – scan a pair of shoes, for example, and Pinterest’s image recognition tech will show you similar products based on that reference point. Google will soon release something similar, though Google’s Lens is a little more complex, and has a lot more capacity for utility and innovation. With Google Lens, your smartphone camera won’t just see what you see, but will also understand what you see to help you take action. #io17 pic.twitter.com/viOmWFjqk1 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 As you can see from this example, Google’s Lens will be able to use image recognition, in integration with Google Assistant and AR, to identify content and overlay that with relevant information. Facebook recently previewed similar through their advanced AR tools, though they’re not at the level Google appears to be, and they don’t have the vast search resources that Google does, which could make Google’s option more useful. Among the various use cases for Google Lens, you’ll be able to see a restaurant’s rating when scanning the storefront, you’ll be able to get information about animals or plants you see, direct from Google, and you’ll be able to listen to music from a band simply by pointing Lens at a concert poster. And there’s also this: Point the camera at a Wi-Fi router, scan the network, and connect. AR enabled tools offer huge potential, and all the major networks are looking at real-world/AR integrations like this to add additional functionality and utility to their apps. Just last week, China’s biggest social app WeChat showcased some of their coming AR functions, which actually look very similar to Google’s Lens functionality. Where Google may be able to win out is through their vast range of discovery data and tools – Google’s already the platform you rely on for such information, the name users trust in search. If nothing else, what is clear is that AR will change the face of digital marketing – it’s worth considering how such tools could influence your target markets as usage behaviors evolve. Google Assistant on iPhone Further expanding on their virtual assistant tools – which are already fast becoming a key consideration for SEO purposes - Google has announced that their Google Assistant tool will soon be made available on iOS, in addition to Android devices. Starting today, we're bringing the #GoogleAssistant to iPhones. Whether at home or on the go, your Assistant is here to help. #io17 pic.twitter.com/a6T20HwnU9 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google Assistant is already built into Google’s Allo messaging app (which is also available on iOS) and enables users to conduct Google searches in message streams, helping to plan meet-ups and access relevant information in context. The expanded availability of Google Assistant should get more people using the tool, giving them immediate access to Google search – though it may not be the most intuitive addition on iOS, given various search options already exist. Where Google Assistant would appear to add the most value is in message streams, like it does within Google Allo, which is not exactly how it’s set to work in this new form (though you will be able to address it by voice). That said, it’s a powerful search tool, and could see wider adoption. Worth noting usage trends. Google also noted that Google Assistant is already available on over 100 million Android devices. Smart Reply Google’s also expanding their automated email reply system, already active within their Inbox app, to Gmail. Called ‘Smart Reply’, the option has seen significant increase in usage since launch, now accounting for around 12% of all Inbox replies via mobile device. As you can see here, Smart Reply scans the text of your emails then provides suggested responses, which you can action in one tap. It can’t suggest replies for all your emails, only those it can provide ‘optimal responses’ for, but it can save you time when replying on the go. Smart Reply is being rolled out to all English Gmail users from today. New Photo Tools Google Photos, which now has 500 million users, is also getting a few upgrades, with suggested sharing, which will recommend connections to share your images with based on your interaction history and who’s in each photo (similar to Facebook’s image recognition within Moments and via tag recommendations), and an automated sharing function, which enables you to grant other people access to your pictures. Google’s also going to start selling photo books – physical hardcopy collections of your chosen images. As explained by The Verge: “You can make one on your phone or on the web, starting at $10 for a softcover 7-inch square book and $20 for a 9-inch hardcover book. In both cases, that cost covers only the first 20 pages — which isn't a ton of photos, particularly if you've just taken a big vacation. Each additional page is $0.35 to $0.65, and it adds up in a hurry: a sample book I made about a vacation to Italy wound up costing me $55, which is probably at least $50 more than it cost Google to make.” And this: Google’s working on a new way to automatically remove unwanted elements from photos, Photoshop style – sort of similar to Snapchat’s recently added ‘Magic Eraser’ but more advanced. There’s no word as to when this new option will be rolled out as yet. Stand Alone VR While VR is still a way off seeing wide adoption, Google’s also developing advanced VR tools, including a standalone VR headset that doesn’t require any additional systems. New #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC. #io17 pic.twitter.com/7TpYPJGEdU — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 One of the biggest impediments to VR adoption, of course, is price, which this won’t necessarily solve, but it does provide another option for VR usage, and hints at a future where VR will be a more compact, self-contained offering. YouTube 360 Videos on TV Sets And the last major announcement from the first day of Google I/O is the option to watch YouTube 360 content on your home TV screens, using your remote as the toggle to change perspective. Given watch time of YouTube content on home TV screens has doubled in the last year, it makes sense for YouTube to be looking to being more options to their integrated TV offering, though I’m not sure 360 content is going to translate that well. In addition - and possibly even more significant for social content creators - YouTube’s also releasing its Super Chat API, which will enable live-stream creators to add in new, interactive elements. YouTube released their Super Chat option back in January, which enables live-stream viewers to pay to have their comments featured within a stream, with a percentage of any such payments going to creators, enabling direct monetization of live-streams (note: not available to all user as yet) As explained by BuzzFeed, the new Super Chat API, will facilitate expanded viewer actions “…the API will let creators give fans the ability to do things like turn the lights on and off in live videos or, as demonstrated on stage at IO, launch a water balloon at them.” The capacity opens up a new range of considerations for live-streamers, which could make it a more engaging, more interactive, and a more lucrative option moving forward. There were a range of other new tools and projects announced at Google I/O, but these are the key elements that have direct digital marketing implications in the immediate term. And this is only day one – I/O goes for another couple of days yet, though going on years past, the big announcements all come in the first 24 hours. We’ll keep you updated if any other major projects are announced.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 19 May 2017 | MYT 8:30 AM GE Appliances to get Google voice control option GE Appliances' connected suite now integrates with the Google Assistant. — AFP Relaxnews GE Appliances announced a deal with Google enabling the US tech giant's voice control home hub to be used for cooking, cleaning and other functions.  The deal enables GE's "Geneva" to communicate with the Google Assistant, so users can say: "Ok Google, ask Geneva Home to set the oven timer for 10 minutes." The announcement comes nearly a year after GE Appliances unveiled a similar tie-up with Amazon's Alexa-powered speakers. It also comes as Google was expected to unveil more partnerships and initiatives in artificial intelligence at its developers conference in California. "Everyone's busy these days and our consumers are looking for simpler and more convenient ways to control their home, especially when busy in the kitchen or working around the house," said Liz VerSchure, vice president at GE Appliances, a unit of the Chinese electronics group Haier. "Integrating our full suite of connected appliances with the Google Assistant makes it easier for owners to control their appliances and get on with their day." Consumers will be able to use voice commands to preheat their own meals, or check if laundry or dishes are cleaned with connected GE appliances, the companies said. Google and its parent company Alphabet have been seeking to diversify beyond Internet search to new kinds of services, many focused on artificial intelligence which powers its Google Home hub and other devices. — AFP Relaxnews   Related Stories You May Be Interested Uber renews push for arbitration in Waymo trade-secrets case Hackers steal 17 million users’ data from Indian restaurant app Zomato The evolution of mobile phones Coway promotes a healthy lifestyle When the CEO is your mentor 10 after work habits for personal success Others Also Read Mums treated to hearty buffet brunch on special day DPM: There's no excuse for cops to flout the law Check out Sungai Buloh's Valley of Hope advertisement Latest News UK’s May opens door to Facebook tax in push for safer web Google wants all online ads to run on its speedy mobile formats Microsoft to open Africa datacentres to seek edge in cloud push Uber renews push for arbitration in Waymo trade-secrets case Security experts find clues to ransomware worm’s lingering risks Most Viewed in Tech WannaCry ransomware: should users pay the ransom money?

Netflix quickly confirmed that it would start blocking the installation of the app from the Play Store for devices that didn’t pass Google’s Safety Net. Now, Google has updated the Google Play Console to make it easier for all developers to do the same thing… UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases At I/O 2017, Google added a bunch of new tools to the Play Console that includes new ways to check application performance, publish Instant Apps, and much more. One thing Google didn’t mention on stage but did post on its support page is the ability to easily restrict applications from being installed on devices that didn’t meet SafetyNet’s standards. All a developer needs to do to access these new tools is to have uploaded at least one APK to the console. After selecting the application in which they would like to set restriction upon, head on over to the side menu, click on the arrow next to Release Management, and select device catalog. This is the new location where developers can see what Android phones, tablets, TVs, and smartwatches do and do not work with the application. In the middle of the screen, there is a button labeled as Excluded Devices. Once in that section, developers can choose to either not exclude their application based on SafetyNet, exclude devices that don’t pass basic integrity, or entirely exclude it from both. Long story short, Google is giving developers more tools to easily block users who are either rooted, running a custom ROM, or have an unlocked bootloader from downloading their applications from the Play Store. Now that it is easy to do so, it would not be surprising if we saw more developers decide to go this route. Thankfully, this is not the same thing as Google’s SafetyNet API. The applications that are blocked on the Google Play Store side can still be sideloaded as APKs and used as normal, but applications like Android Pay with the full API cannot run at all if the device does not meet SafetyNet’s standards.

Google Assistant will soon support sending money with your Google account Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/18 12:26pm PDTMay 18, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 43 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares107 Google News Videos We've already taken a brief look at Google's new PayPal-like payment API which was introduced during a session at I/O today. Potentially the coolest application for this is going to be the ability to send payments to friends and others with Google Assistant. During Gerardo Capiel and Varouj Chitilian's session on Google's commerce technologies, they introduced the new API and then proceeded to show us "something really cool that no one's seen before". If you skip 14 minutes into the video, you'll see them set up a feature demo under the pretense that Gerardo needs to pay Varouj for dinner. Instead of using Gmail's "send money" function through the Gmail app, they decide to show us that Google Assistant is now capable of doing the hard work for us. Gerardo asks the Assistant to "send Gerardo $10 for dinner", and sure enough it uses the new payment API to go ahead and send the payment. The p2p payment uses the debit card linked to your Google account, and they also mentioned that they'll soon be adding other p2p payment providers. It's pretty nifty and represents yet another way that Google Assistant is becoming more and more powerful, with lots of great new capabilities being announced at I/O this year.

The best part is that it seems that the companies are planning on updating their existing line of products to make them compatible with Google Assistant and Google Home, which means that you won’t have to purchase brand new equipment if your current appliance is already supported with the upcoming feature. This includes appliances such as fridges, ovens, washers, dryers, and so on. However before you get too excited at the prospect of being able to speak to your washer and tell it to start washing your clothes, users will still need a device like Google Home or their phone in order to communicate with their appliances, but basically with the integration of Google Assistant, the company plans on making it a one-stop shop, kind of like what the Home app is for iOS devices. LG is expected to roll out support later this month, while GE has stated that support should have already begun rolling out. Filed in Gadgets >Home.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. >> Authorities say three people were injured after a fire broke out during Google’s I/O developer conference in California. It happened today at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. Mountain View Fire Department spokesman Lynn Brown says three people were taken to a hospital and one had life-threatening injuries. Google said in a statement that the “small fire” broke out in a kitchen at the venue and no conference attendees were hurt. The company says the three people who were injured were event staff members and are receiving treatment. Brown says investigators are working to determine what sparked the blaze.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news.

However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see.

(AP) — Authorities say three people were injured after a kitchen fire broke out during Google’s I/O developer conference at a California venue that normally hosts concerts. It happened Thursday at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View. Mountain View Fire Department spokesman Lynn Brown says three people were taken to a hospital and one had life-threatening injuries. Google said in a statement that the small fire broke out in a kitchen at the venue and no conference attendees were hurt.

Brown says a flash fire broke out when workers were trying to light a deep-fat fryer. The kitchen’s sprinklers put out the blaze.

Adam Turner Follow on Google Plus Follow on Twitter 23 reading now Show comments facebook SHARE twitter TWEET email google-plus linkedin reddit More When it arrives mid-year, talking to Google's attentive benchtop speaker will be more about striking up a conversation than simply issuing commands. Google's pint-sized smart speaker is finally coming to Australia, designed to sit on your kitchen bench, coffee table or bedside table so it's always at your beck and call. It's completely hands-free, relying on the AI-powered Google Assistant; just say "Okay Google" to get its attention and then tell it what you need. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The talkative Google Home smart benchtop speaker is vying for a place in Australian homes.  Google Home is going to cost more than $200 in Australia so you really need a good use for it once the novelty wears off, just as you might have grown weary of taunting the talkative assistant on your smartphone. The developers of Google Home and Google Assistant say that the four main uses people find for the smart speaker are answering queries, playing music, managing your schedule and controlling your smart home devices. If you'd tick at least two of those boxes then you might consider Google Home good value, especially when you consider that 'answering queries' extends to services which are connected to Google such as flight times and traffic reports. Listen closely Google Assistant's strengths compared to other interactive voice assistants are its power to comprehend natural language rather than just keywords and its ability to remember context from your previous question. As a testament to its abilities, Google says around 70 per cent of voice interactions are natural language rather than users barking orders, because they trust it to understand them. Advertisement This means you can ask "Who is the Prime Minister of Canada?" followed by "How tall is he?" and Google Assistant knows that you're still talking about Justin Trudeau. Apple's Siri is making progress in this department but there's work to be done; ask Siri the second question and she replies "Okay, I found this on the web for "How tall is Canada". So when you get past the fun and games, where would you put Google Home to work? To me it makes the most sense in the kitchen. It's the place where you're most likely to have your hands full making it inconvenient to reach for your phone, whether you're making school lunches or cooking dinner. Google is adding the ability to set timers, alarms and reminders via Google Home, which will certainly make it more useful in a busy kitchen. The kitchen is also a room which is less likely to have a decent speaker compared to the living areas of your home, so Google Home is handy if you like to listen to music while you cook – controlling your music hands-free. Time to shop Considering all this, it's interesting that shopping didn't get a mention in that list of top uses from Google's developers, even though Google Home works with Google Shopping Express in the US (unfortunately it isn't available in Australia). If you envision yourself standing in front of your open pantry and dictating a shopping list or even ordering items directly, then Amazon's Echo smart speaker might be a better fit in your kitchen. It's not available in Australia yet but it's certainly on the cards considering that Amazon intends to finally get serious about Australian retail this year.  That said, Google insists it's working hard to forge partnerships with Australian providers before it launches, which will include retailers. You'll likely be able to order a pizza with your voice, rather than opening a separate app on your phone, and it's possible that local supermarkets could also get in on the act. A matter of trust This brings us to my key concern about Google Home living in my kitchen; the thought of my children discovering that pizza is only an "Okay Google" away. In the US, Google Home can distinguish between different voices but this feature has been slow to roll out globally and Google can't confirm whether it will be available at launch in Australia. Meanwhile all voices are treated equally and perhaps it would benefit from a fingerprint reader to confirm some requests, unless you opt to disable this extra security measure. Once Google Home knows exactly who you are, it becomes a lot more practical to ask "what's on my calendar today?" Even when multi-user support eventually comes to Australia, Google assumes that every user is at least 13 years old so it doesn't offer a lot in terms of granular parental controls. This means you'll need to dive into your children's advanced Google account settings if you want to ensure that Google Home doesn't become a bottomless vending machine or start answering awkward questions like "where do babies come from?" It'll take some trial and error, with a few awkward moments along the way, to figure out exactly how Google Home fits into your life. What would you use it for?

Not everything that’s making news at I/O is being announced on a stage, though. An unreleased version of Google’s Pixel Launcher was spotted by 9to5Google at a Google I/O Sandbox demo. The Pixel phones were demoing Android’s Instant Apps feature, but they also included a version of the Pixel Launcher that looks a bit different than the one that Google currently offers. The most notable change with this unreleased Pixel Launcher is the Google Search user interface. Rather than appearing as a pill-shaped button in the upper left corner of your screen, this Pixel Launcher has a gray bar that stretches across the entire screen and sits between your docked apps and the on-screen Android navigation buttons. A second video shows the unreleased Pixel Launcher being used to search for Android Instant Apps. There’s not a lot known about this Pixel Launcher and when or if it’ll be released to consumers. The new Google Search bar looks kind of strange sitting between the dock apps and on-screen navigation buttons, but that location would make it much easier to perform a search when you’re holding your phone, especially on the 5.5-inch and larger smartphone displays that are popular. We’ll just have to wait and see if Google ends up releasing this new Pixel Launcher to the public, like with Android O or new Pixel phones. What do you think of this unreleased Pixel Launcher?

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...?

Some analysts and developers say the move could eat into the business of iOS and Android app ecosystems. Parent company Tencent this week reported its highest quarterly profit growth in three years. 5 Hours AgoReuters SHARES In a cluster of refurbished Mao-era industrial buildings in Guangzhou, developers at China's top messaging app, WeChat, are redesigning key parts of its product to spread its tentacles to just about every aspect of Chinese life. Around 1,500 developers, mainly twenty-something males, have been tasked with increasing user engagement through new 'mini-programs' on WeChat that look and operate much like apps on Apple Inc's iOS and Google's Android operating systems — but are far less data-intensive. WeChat | YouTube WeChat commercial promoting it's app. WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, says it's not a direct challenge to the dominant mobile platforms, but some analysts and developers say the new business could eat into that of iOS and Android app ecosystems. "In the long-term, the relationship between Tencent and Apple's ecosystems will be co-existence and 'co-opetition' — intense competition in some areas and time periods, coupled with some form of cooperation in others," said Su Ning, professor of Information Systems at Ivey Business School in Canada. With more than 938 million users, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. Half the users spend more than 90 minutes a day on its chat app, according to WeChat. WeChat's push on these nimble mini-apps comes as Google this week launched its own Android Instant Apps, which don't require downloading and are available on certain Android devices, though access to Google products in China is heavily restricted. WeChat says there are about 200,000 third-party developers for the WeChat platform. "A very strong trend in China is that demand for iOS and Android apps is waning, while that for programme developing based on WeChat is rising," said Leon Du, co-founder of Guangzhou-based Beansmile, a digital consultancy that develops apps and websites. Helped by WeChat-based advertising and payment-related services, Tencent this week reported its highest profit growth in three years for the first quarter. show chapters Tencent 'could be a road map for Facebook'    Wednesday, 17 May 2017 | 8:37 PM ET | 01:41 While Tencent doesn't release data on the number of mini-programs available, Dong Xu, a manager at market data firm Analysys, says her interviews with businesses suggest the adoption rate has so far been modest. "Mini-programs are mainly used for low-frequency, offline scenarios, such as fee payments, parking, and customer inquiries," Dong said. "Users' in-depth needs such as entertainment and e-commerce still take place with apps." Third-party developers say the mini-programs, built in WeChat's proprietary programming language, are less data-heavy and easier to develop than their iOS or Android counterparts. Users, for example, can tap a programme on a restaurant's official WeChat account to order food, have it delivered to their table and pay for it, all in one app. WeChat also last month quietly established a new department dedicated to online searching, and this week rolled out a beta search-engine box with enhanced power, revealing its ambition to take on rival Baidu Inc. PAY WARS Central to its plans for an expansive and dynamic app ecosystem is the development of WeChat's own payment infrastructure. Around 300 developers work for WeChat Pay, which competes with Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and to a lesser extent, Apple Pay, which launched in China last year. TenPay, which runs WeChat Pay and Tencent's smaller QQ Wallet, is China's most popular mobile payment provider by users, with 838 million users dwarfing Alipay's 432 million, according to Analysys. At a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday, Tencent President Martin Lau flagged WeChat Pay's goal to permeate all aspects of consumer life in China. Bloomberg | Getty Images Tencent's new headquarters in Shenzhen, China, pictured in August 2016 For Apple, which wants to deepen its reach in China, the world's biggest mobile spender, WeChat's large and loyal fan base and its payment service present a challenge. China overtook the United States as the biggest contributor to Apple's iOS app store revenue last year, according to mobile data analytics firm App Annie. However, Apple's Greater China revenue dropped 14 percent in the first three months of the year, as cheaper rivals chipped away at sales. Apple declined to comment for this article. Last month, some Chinese WeChat fans threatened to ditch Apple products after the U.S. firm forced the chat app to abolish a popular tipping function. While building user loyalty is a core part of both Apple's and WeChat's strategies, Zhang Ying, general manager of WeChat Pay, has downplayed product tensions from the tipping spat. "Apple is still supportive of the [WeChat] ecosystem. We are part of the [Apple] ecosystem," he told a forum in Hong Kong last month. "It is far from a 'choose-one-or-another' - it's merely some disagreement."

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on.

Tamsin McMahon SAN FRANCISCO — The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Apr. 25, 2017 10:54AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Apr. 25, 2017 11:00AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Canada’s support for net neutrality at a time when the U.S. appears set to roll back its own Internet freedom regulations is an advantage to Ottawa as it tries to encourage major digital media firms such as Netflix and Google to support and distribute more Canadian-made content, Canadian Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly says. Ms. Joly has been in California over the past week meeting with U.S. media, entertainment and tech executives in Los Angeles and San Francisco to beef up support for Canada’s arts and entertainment industry exports, including promoting Canada’s post-production and video games industries. Among her key messages in meetings with high-level film and tech leaders such as Cheryl Boone Isaacs, president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Canadian filmmaker Denis Villeneuve and executives from Google and Facebook, is that a free and open Internet is one that includes access to a wide variety of content, particularly that is produced outside of Hollywood. “I think that we’re trying to have a cultural policy that is adapted to the digital age, whereby you believe in the importance of freedom of the Internet, you believe in the importance of net neutrality,” she said in an interview. “What we’re adding to that equation is you need cultural diversity.” Her visit comes as the U.S. and Canada appear headed in different directions when it comes to policing how Internet service providers control access to online content. Last week, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ruled that ISPs can’t discriminate between types of online content in a case that prohibited Quebecor Inc.-owned Videotron from offering music streaming services to some wireless customers that wouldn’t count toward their monthly data caps. The ruling has been hailed as a win for Ottawa’s support of “net neutrality,” a term that means all Internet traffic should be treated equally. At the same time, Silicon Valley giants have been gearing up for a fight with U.S. President Donald Trump’s new appointees to the Federal Communications Commission over what they fear will be rollback in U.S. laws supporting net neutrality. “Sorry Canada, now you’re in the class with backward India,” Roslyn Layton, an FCC-adviser appointed by Mr. Trump, wrote on Twitter after last week’s CRTC ruling. Ms. Joly said her message that Canada supports freedom of choice on the Internet resonated in her talks with Silicon Valley leaders. “It is certainly an advantage,” she said. “That’s why we’re saying cultural diversity is important to us but, by the way, we profoundly believe in the freedom of the Internet and net neutrality and we are committed to it.” In contrast to some European countries, which have threatened punitive legislation to extract concessions from tech giants to support their cultural content, the federal Liberals have been taking a more collaborative approach to U.S.-based digital media companies that now control the vast amount of content streaming into Canadian homes over the Internet. Ms. Joly has already ruled out the idea of taxing tech giants such as Amazon and Netflix based on revenues earned in Canada. She said her visit to California was primarily an “information finding” trip, rather than a chance to raise the threat of protectionist legislation. Her efforts in Los Angeles included the set up of an advisory committee made up of Canadians working in the entertainment industry to help Canada expand its cultural exports. Even so, Ms. Joly came away with few concrete promises from her meetings, instead describing her talks with Hollywood and Silicon Valley as part of an “ongoing conversation.” She acknowledges Canada likely faces an uphill battle in convincing media giants to voluntarily invest in Canadian culture. “I’m optimistic,” she said, “but I’m not naive.” Report Typo/Error Follow Tamsin McMahon on Twitter: @tamsinrm   More Related to this Story New FCC head Ajit Pai could influence Canada’s net neutrality policies Canada’s analog broadcasting policy makes no sense in a digital world CRTC rules music streaming services cannot be exempt from data plans Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Next story | Learn More Discover content from The Globe and Mail that you might otherwise not have come across.

Shane Dingman - TECHNOLOGY REPORTER The Globe and Mail Published Tuesday, Apr. 25, 2017 10:00AM EDT Last updated Tuesday, Apr. 25, 2017 4:09PM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn PrintLicense article Every year, Google.com makes hundreds of changes to improve the computer code of its search engine, but in an attempt to combat the scourge of fake news and offensive content, its engineers are beginning to collect data from a new source: humans. “It’s become very apparent that a small set of queries in our daily traffic (around 0.25 per cent), have been returning offensive or clearly misleading content,” writes Ben Gomes, vice-president of engineering for Google, in a blog post outlining some policy changes that will seek more user feedback in an effort to clean up some of the scandals related to automatically generated sections of its search results. Google’s troubles with offensive content have been popping up with more frequency in recent months. In October, 2016, users noticed Google would sometimes autocomplete the phrase “are jews …” with the word “evil.” After a public outcry the company made changes to remove the offending lines, adding more scrutiny in its algorithm to so-called “sensitive” topics. But even after the fixes, its search engine still regularly turns up offensive results. For example, right now, users who type “are black” into a Google search bar might see autocomplete suggestions such as “are black people smart,” which leads to a search page topped by a story about the offensiveness of that autocomplete suggestion, followed by a Fox News article claiming a DNA connection to intelligence and a fourth article with the headline: “Black people aren’t human.” That last article is from an organization called National Vanguard, which is identified as a U.S. neo-Nazi white nationalist splinter group by the Southern Poverty Law Centre. To combat the problem, Google is giving regular users a new “report” button on its search-bar autocomplete feature so people can more easily alert Google to problematic results. A similar button will be added to the “featured snippets” section of its results pages. Autocomplete and featured snippets – previews of search results – have both been the subject of controversies that involved the promotion of conspiracy theories, fake news and racist slurs on the hugely popular website. After Tuesday, a user who spots an offensive autocomplete result will be able to flag it for Google’s engineers to review. But even these high-profile anecdotes don’t capture the scale of the problem Google faces. The company doesn’t say how many searches a day it processes; it simply says it processes “trillions” of search requests a year. So while one-quarter of 1 per cent of bad content might be a good result for almost any other enterprise, Google could be responding to many billions of user requests a year with these “low quality” results. Small for Google is still a potential avalanche of unwelcome content for users. Mr. Gomes explained that content promoting hate is also being given the lowest possible search weighting, and an increased importance will be given to “high-quality” sources of information, particularly on sensitive topics. The process of sifting through search results involves a mix of algorithm and human-curation efforts. For instance, Google has seen posts containing Holocaust-denying falsehoods ranking high in its searches – an absurd condition when there is excellent scholarship and documentation of the horrors of the Holocaust available online. Google is also releasing more details about its human “raters” – a hand-picked group of 10,000 users who already give Google feedback on the hundreds of tests it runs to improve search results. In addition to this extra monitoring, Mr. Gomes and Google believe making feedback tools easier to find for the rest of the general public could expand the effectiveness of this human-curation effort. Mr. Gomes and Pandu Nayak (a Google research fellow in search quality) said on Monday that some of Google’s problems come from users trying to game the system to gain a higher ranking for their content (which can lead to more ad dollars, among other effects). The company blog described “low-quality ‘content farms,’ hidden text and other deceptive practices,” among the tactics. In that environment, Google’s challenge is to guard against abuse of the new feedback buttons. For instance, if Google guaranteed that flagging content would remove a search result, unethical users could wield a “banhammer” to block content they didn’t like or in order to favour their own content. “There is likely to be [helpful] signal in there, even through all the noise through abuse,” Mr. Nayak says. “We don’t expect the problem will completely disappear.” Content problems with Google’s featured snippets may even be more serious. According to the search engine optimizing service MozCast, currently about 15 per cent of Google searches return a result including a featured snippet, which on Google.com just looks like a text box – one of many results – off to the right side. However, if you searched using one of Google’s voice-assistant or smart-home products and a snippet was returned, the context of the other results on a Web page is missing and the service would read the snippet aloud as if that was the one true answer. In recent months, users have posted videos of a “smart device” responding with answers sponsored by racist or conspiratorial sites, such as false claims that former president Barack Obama was plotting a coup, or allegations that four U.S. presidents had been members of the Ku Klux Klan (there is little evidence to suggest any U.S. president was an active or former KKK member). “There are people who are writing all kinds of things on the Web,” says Mr. Gomes, who added that one issue Google is having is finding high-quality sources to promote in place of some of the more explicit content. “Journalists are not covering some of these conspiracy theories.” As Mr. Gomes points out in his blog post, it’s both a strength and a limitation of its service that Google doesn’t create its own content. The trouble is that some users go to Google to find others who agree with the latest reality-challenged statement from their preferred political leader … Other users who find the same counterfactual content might assume the world -+ or Google – has gone mad. “The content that appears in these features is generated algorithmically and is a reflection of what people are searching for and what’s available on the Web. This can sometimes lead to results that are unexpected,” Mr. Gomes writes. The changes began rolling out in the U.S. and international markets today.

(Getty Images/iStockphoto) Outsourcing data security to a cloud service can be safer and cheaper because it allows businesses to take advantage of significantly greater resources, experts say. (Getty Images/iStockphoto) SMALL-BUSINESS DATA SECURITY Cloud storage keeps data out of reach of criminals Add to ... Peter Nowak Special to The Globe and Mail Published Friday, May 12, 2017 11:33AM EDT Last updated Friday, May 12, 2017 11:33AM EDT Comments Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Print As chief information security officer for Amazon Web Services, Stephen Schmidt is surprised by how many businesses still fail to see the dangers of storing information on computers and servers in their offices rather than in the cloud. Not only is that data vulnerable to physical calamities such as fire or hardware failure, the onus is also on the businesses themselves to protect their hardware and networks against hackers and other online attacks. Maintaining so-called “on-premises” storage is particularly risky for small and medium-sized companies, the bread and butter of Canada’s economy, since they typically don’t have large IT staffs or the resources to spend on countering these growing threats. Outsourcing data security to a cloud service such as the Amazon.com Inc. subsidiary AWS, on the other hand, is safer and cheaper because it allows businesses to take advantage of significantly greater resources, Mr. Schmidt says. “If you have a customer who thinks they’re safer on-premises than they are on the cloud because they’re behind a firewall that somebody installed, they should seriously re-evaluate their risk.” It’s an expected position from Amazon, which competes against a number of big technology companies including Google and Microsoft in selling cloud services to other businesses, but recent converts tend to agree. Jour de la Terre, for example, began moving its data online last year. The 15-person non-profit, which promotes Earth Day activities in Quebec and France, had previously stored its websites, e-mail, documents and streaming videos on separate servers in its Montreal offices. Director Pierre Lussier says he was initially nervous about putting all of his figurative eggs into one cloud basket, but that was before he realized the precariousness of his existing situation. Much of his organization’s information was managed by a single person who ended up leaving the organization. Without his collected knowledge of where all the data was and how it could be accessed, there was disarray. “We found out how vulnerable we were,” Mr. Lussier says. “It was a total mess.” Jour de la Terre is now on track to finish migrating all of its information by June. Staff have to learn how to interact with the new system, but it’s proving to be more convenient and secure for everyone involved. “You have one gate and the knowledge that [employees] go through that gate,” he adds. “I’ve gained so much.” Axia NetMedia, a fibre-optic Internet service provider based in Calgary, began its conversion to the cloud three years ago out of necessity when it acquired a new corporate customer. The client required more data services than Axia could itself quickly deliver, so the ISP signed on to AWS to scale up. The company, which employs 150 people and counts the Alberta government, Sunterra Farms and the Post Hotel in Lake Louise, Alta., as customers, has been moving more and more of its business to the cloud since then. Tie Hoekstra, manager of corporate IT controls and security, believes Axia’s services are more secure now because he no longer has to worry about protecting customers’ data himself. That responsibility has been shifted to Amazon and its deep pockets. “You can’t duplicate the tools that they’re able to give you to maintain your levels of security without spending an enormous amount of money,” he says. Google echoes that sentiment. Like Amazon, Microsoft and other cloud service rivals, the search company runs most of its operations on its own custom-designed hardware, from the servers that data is stored on to the networks that connect them. To that end, Google in March unveiled Titan, a specially designed microchip that adds cryptographic capabilities to servers. Each of the cloud companies effectively resell the same security they rely on for their own services to other businesses. “Our scale allows us to build in security from the ground up,” says Niels Provos, a distinguished engineer at Google. “Many of the worries you have about securing your on-premises machines do not exist in the cloud.” That’s not to say the cloud is a magic font of security for all businesses. While it does solve a number of problems, it also potentially introduces new ones. Data sovereignty, where information is stored locally in a specific country rather than on the U.S.-based servers of the big tech companies, has been a growing issue since the U.S. National Security Agency spying revelations a few years ago. Government clients, especially, are requiring cloud providers to base their data centres within their own borders, to keep their information from crossing over into other jurisdictions. Those requirements were the main drivers for both Amazon and Google opening Canadian data centres in the Montreal region over the past few months. Location, however, isn’t the only determining factor behind data sovereignty – local laws can also come into play and sometimes conflict. Microsoft, for example, narrowly won a legal victory last January against the U.S. Department of Justice, which was trying to force access to customer data stored in Ireland. Localized storage therefore isn’t a silver bullet against unwanted search and seizure, which means that businesses with sensitive information will still need to seek out legal advice. “Just because a company says you have data sovereignty, it doesn’t necessarily mean that all the nations involved will agree,” says Christopher Parsons, a research associate at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab. Mr. Parsons adds that storing data with Amazon, Google or Microsoft could also be awkward for any business that is looking to compete against those companies, a growing possibility given their respective sizes and scopes. The companies will insist that their customers’ data is sacred and that they will never access it, but the incentive will always be there. Still, as long as businesses are aware of some of these new risks, the cloud can indeed provide capabilities they can’t otherwise access. “Google’s [and other cloud providers’] security team will almost inevitably be better than what you can provide,” Mr. Parsons says.

 China's WeChat is unleashing a swarm of 'mini-apps' to eat into Apple's biggest online business Reuters May 18, 2017, 8:40 PM 2,295 facebook linkedin twitter email print VCG/VCG via Getty Images In a cluster of refurbished Mao-era industrial buildings in Guangzhou, developers at China's top messaging app, WeChat, are redesigning key parts of its product to spread its tentacles to just about every aspect of Chinese life. Around 1,500 developers, mainly twentysomething males, have been tasked with increasing user engagement through new 'mini-programs' on WeChat that look and operate much like apps on Apple Inc's iOS and Google's Android operating systems - but are far less data-intensive. WeChat, owned by Tencent Holdings, says it's not a direct challenge to the dominant mobile platforms, but some analysts and developers say the new business could eat into that of iOS and Android app ecosystems. "In the long-term, the relationship between Tencent and Apple's ecosystems will be co-existence and 'co-opetition' - intense competition in some areas and time periods, coupled with some form of cooperation in others," said Su Ning, professor of Information Systems at Ivey Business School in Canada. With more than 938 million users, WeChat, known as Weixin in China, already serves as a one-stop-shop for everything from reading news and booking taxis to ordering takeaways and making payments. Half the users spend more than 90 minutes a day on its chat app, according to WeChat. WeChat's push on these nimble mini-apps comes as Google this week launched its own Android Instant Apps, which don't require downloading and are available on certain Android devices, though access to Google products in China is heavily restricted. WeChat says there are about 200,000 third-party developers for the WeChat platform. "A very strong trend in China is that demand for iOS and Android apps is waning, while that for program developing based on WeChat is rising," said Leon Du, co-founder of Guangzhou-based Beansmile, a digital consultancy that develops apps and websites. Helped by WeChat-based advertising and payment-related services, Tencent this week reported its highest profit growth in three years for the first quarter. While Tencent doesn't release data on the number of mini-programs available, Dong Xu, a manager at market data firm Analysys, says her interviews with businesses suggest the adoption rate has so far been modest. "Mini-programs are mainly used for low-frequency, offline scenarios, such as fee payments, parking, and customer inquiries," Dong said. "Users' in-depth needs such as entertainment and e-commerce still take place with apps." Third-party developers say the mini-programs, built in WeChat's proprietary programming language, are less data-heavy and easier to develop than their iOS or Android counterparts. Users, for example, can tap a program on a restaurant's official WeChat account to order food, have it delivered to their table and pay for it, all in one app. WeChat also last month quietly established a new department dedicated to online searching, and this week rolled out a beta search-engine box with enhanced power, revealing its ambition to take on rival Baidu Inc.  Pay wars Thomson Reuters Central to its plans for an expansive and dynamic app ecosystem is the development of WeChat's own payment infrastructure. Around 300 developers work for WeChat Pay, which competes with Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, and to a lesser extent, Apple Pay, which launched in China last year. TenPay, which runs WeChat Pay and Tencent's smaller QQ Wallet, is China's most popular mobile payment provider by users, with 838 million users dwarfing Alipay's 432 million, according to Analysys. At a post-earnings conference call on Wednesday, Tencent President Martin Lau flagged WeChat Pay's goal to permeate all aspects of consumer life in China. For Apple, which wants to deepen its reach in China, the world's biggest mobile spender, WeChat's large and loyal fan base and its payment service present a challenge. China overtook the United States as the biggest contributor to Apple's iOS app store revenue last year, according to mobile data analytics firm App Annie. However, Apple's Greater China revenue dropped 14 percent in the first three months of the year, as cheaper rivals chipped away at sales. Apple declined to comment for this article. Last month, some Chinese WeChat fans threatened to ditch Apple products after the U.S. firm forced the chat app to abolish a popular tipping function. While building user loyalty is a core part of both Apple's and WeChat's strategies, Zhang Ying, general manager of WeChat Pay, has downplayed product tensions from the tipping spat. "Apple is still supportive of the ecosystem. We are part of the ecosystem," he told a forum in Hong Kong last month. "It is far from a 'choose-one-or-another' - it's merely some disagreement."

Photo from Google Blog MOUNTAIN VIEW, California - Google announced Wednesday it was bringing its digital assistant to Apple iPhones as part of its effort to win the battle with tech rivals on artificial intelligence. At its annual developers conference at an outdoor concert-venue near its main campus here, Google unveiled its vision for computing centered around artificial intelligence. "We are now witnessing a new shift in computing: the move from a mobile-first to an AI-first world," Google chief executive Sundar Pichai said during an opening presentation. "It is forcing us to reimagine our products for a world that allows a more natural, seamless way of interacting with technology." Those interactions, for Google, include using artificial intelligence to let people engage computers conversationally, have software anticipate needs, and let smartphone cameras "recognize" what they see. "In an AI-first world, we are rethinking all of our products and applying machine learning to solve problems," Pichai said. Google Assistant, the center of its AI efforts, is in a fierce battle with rivals such as Amazon's Alexa, Microsoft Cortana and Apple's Siri to be the top choice for use in smartphones as well as connected homes, cars and a range of other devices. "Siri's got company, and all these other guys are pretty serious about it," said Gartner analyst Brian Blau. Artificial intelligence is being woven into Google's free Gmail service, used by more than a billion people, for features such as suggesting responses to messages. For example, opening an email containing an invitation to dinner might trigger a prompt to reply "I'm in." SMARTPHONES GET EYES Google machine vision capabilities are being used to enable services such as recognizing who is in pictures and what they are doing as well as translate languages in signs viewed through smartphone cameras, demonstrations showed. Advanced "Lens" features are being added first to the Google Photo application, which is available free. Aiming a smartphone camera at a flower will prompt it to be identified; while aiming it at a complex password and hotspot name on a router will let it automatically log into the wireless connection. Google also unveiled a second-generation computer chip it designed specifically to improve cloud computing capabilities in data centers. "We want Google Cloud to be the best cloud for machine learning," Pichai said. He described the internet giant's core search service and its Google Assistant as the company's most important AI products. Google Assistant, introduced last year, is now on more than 100 million devices, according to the team's vice president of engineering, Scott Huffman. "We are really starting to crack the hard computer challenge of conversationality," Huffman said. "Soon, with Google Lens, your assistant will be able to have a conversation about what you see." Google used the conference to announce a software kit that will let developers build Assistant capabilities into robots, applications, and other computerized creations. Google also announced enhancements to its Home personal assistant, adding abilities such as hands free telephone calls and acting as speakers for wireless audio. ANDROID GETS LEAN Developers cheered when talk turned to Google-backed mobile operating system Android. Google announced that more than two billion devices powered by Android software are used monthly in a freshly passed milestone. The coming version of Android, referred to simply as "O" for the time being, will also have boosted artificial intelligence features along with enhanced security, executives showed. Google is also crafting a lighter version of Android, referred to as "Go," designed for maximum performance on low-cost, entry-level smartphones in developing countries where internet bandwidth is lean or expensive. Google said that while it was happy with the momentum of its Daydream virtual reality platform based on using smartphone as screens in headsets, it is working with partners on stand-alone virtual reality gear. Partners in the endeavor include Vive-maker HTC and Lenovo, according to Google virtual reality team vice president Clay Bavor. The gathering, which attracted some 7,000 developers on site and had thousands more watching online, focused on software with little mention of hardware, noted analyst Blau. "There is a continuing trend where devices are becoming devalued and what is on the screen is becoming more valuable," Blau said. "With AI, all the apps are getting upgraded so they don't need new hardware." © Agence France-Presse Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Read More:  Google   Apple   Google Assistant   Siri   artificial intelligence   /business/03/07/17/google-parents-lawsuit-against-uber-cements-end-of-uneasy-marriage /business/03/16/17/apple-google-facebook-skip-legal-challenge-to-new-travel-ban /overseas/03/22/17/google-allows-users-to-share-their-locations-in-mapping-app /life/04/03/17/google-gnome-wins-april-fools-day /business/04/18/17/google-to-open-up-android-to-rivals-in-russia LATEST NEWS MOST READ Estudyante sa senior high, timbog sa buy-bust May 19, 2017 PNP anti-drug body 'dismayed' by Marcelino release May 19, 2017 OPINION: Duterte forgoes EU aid, sticks to his ‘kill' policy May 19, 2017 Junjun Binay asks court to junk rap over parking building project May 19, 2017 Duterte to fly to Russia for ‘landmark visit’ May 19, 2017 Duterte's 'build, build, build' won't place PH in debt trap: Diokno May 19, 2017 Hontiveros on EU aid snub: Examine China, other countries' interference too May 19, 2017 12 S.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...?

Name: Subject: Message: What Android Instant Apps mean for Google Play install numbers Features Newsby Kris Carlon5 hours ago 2 212 8 During the I/O keynote yesterday, two figures loomed large: two billion active Android devices and 82 billion app installs in the last year. Like it or not, install figures still matter, even to Google. But with Android Instant Apps now an option for anyone interested in making one, what will next year’s Google Play install figures look like? Logic seems to dictate that the more successful Instant Apps become, the worse it looks for Google Play. Google is now advising developers to come up with new markers of success now that install numbers are no longer the most accurate metric. But what about Google? How should Google measure success if one hand is effectively stealing from the other? How should Google measure success if one hand is effectively stealing from the other? According to Google, that kind of internal re-evaluation won’t be necessary because it’s not expecting Instant Apps to affect Google Play install numbers at all. While this may sound a little presumptuous, one can only assume Google has data with which to back up the claim. Instant Apps have been around for a year now after all. Instead, Google expects that Instant Apps will exist as a kind of addendum to the normal state of install affairs. Google sees Instant Apps as more of an on-boarding tool for new users of the full app rather than as an alternative to forced installs of an unwanted app. Following that logic, Google Play install figures should grow at best or remain constant at worse. But Instant Apps usage should be free to grow at the same time. So far so good. Think about it: all those apps you’d never realistically keep installed on your phone can now be accessed on demand. Examples were given of a museum app you only need for its map for a day visit or a food-to-seat delivery app at a sports stadium you only plan to use once. According to Google, rather than being forced to install those apps (and later remove them), most people would simply go without. In this example, Instant Apps supposedly flip the script. Those same people can now enjoy those (unappealing) apps’ functionality for the moment via Instant Apps without having to commit to a full install. But this example runs in opposition to both of Google’s claims: that Instant Apps are an effective on-boarding tool for the full apps and that their use won’t affect Google Play install figures. Sure, people might use them in these particular situations, but they’re just as unlikely to install the full app afterward. Google has no other Play Store metric with as much sex appeal as total install numbers. Only time will tell exactly how Instant Apps will affect Google Play. Whether they will encourage even greater adoption of new apps or simply provide an alternative that decreases Google’s annual app install metric. While developers can easily reassess how they measure the value of their app, Google has no other Play Store measure with as much sex appeal as total install numbers. See also: Everything new in Android O: features and changes 1 day ago We’re unlikely to see Instant App “instances” listed in Google Play alongside install figures. And for those apps that live fruitful lives as Instant Apps but never see significant spike in installs, they won’t benefit from receiving positive reviews from temporary users either. That’s because rating apps is still an exclusive benefit reserved for those that install the full app, no matter how closely the Instant App resembles it. One can only assume Google will be closely following Instant Apps usage and monitoring conversion rates and the like as they continue to roll out. So it’ll be interesting to see if we ever get Instant App usage rates listed alongside Google Play install figures in I/O keynotes to come, or whether Google was right and both numbers will grow alongside one another without any cannibalization.

Thousands of developers have been soaking in the sun and knowledge while Google woos them with free Google Homes, raw vegan salads, and a live performance by LCD Soundsystem. Usually the can't miss moment of the conference is the Day 1 Keynote, when Google announces big changes to Android, Daydream, and other software and services. Yet this year, Android's biggest news was announced four days before the conference. So let's talk about Project Treble, Google's plan to get Android updates to users faster. The pre-show before the Day 1 Keynote of I/O 2017. (Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo) Deciphering Google's blog post on the subject feels like it requires a degree in Computer Science, but in short, it appears Google is changing how the core framework of Android works so that it can push big future updates, like the next iteration of Android, Android O, to phones without waiting on phone carriers or phone designers to do it. This is potentially great for consumers. Most of us have grown bored with Android updates precisely because it's unknown when or even if our phones will get those updates. Android currently boasts two billion monthly active devices, but according to its own numbers only 7.1-per cent of those devices have the latest Android OS (Nougat) installed. Even relatively new phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 were slow to get Nougat, with the rollout starting in earnest just last month, seven months after Nougat launched. That means many S7s still can't run apps side by side, control notifications, or take advantage of the 72 emojis Nougat added. Everything New About Android From Google I/O Today at the annual Google I/O developer conference, we learned about all the updates coming to the latest version of Google's mobile operating system, dubbed Android O for now — at least until its official release later this year. This is the eighth version of the OS (Android 8.0), and even though we've seen some of the additions in the developer preview that launched in March, there's a whole swath of new goodies that Google highlighted at the show. So, without further adieu, here are all the new updates coming to Android. Read more "It would be a massive game changer," mobile developer Brandon John-Freso told me after he and his friends Googled the poorly publicised project. "That's super huge." Indeed, Project Treble, and what it could mean, might be so good that it's kind of alarming it wasn't discussed more during the Day 1 keynote. (Google even told us it didn't have any people on the ground at I/O who were briefed to talk about it.) "I was quite surprised," attendee Glenn Gruber, an analyst with Lopez Research, told Gizmodo. "After how huge Project Treble was, I was sure we'd get bigger news during I/O." Only, as Gruber noted, that didn't happen. Instead we got Photos and a "smarter" Google Assistant. Which is incredible! Project Treble has the potential to fix one of devs', and consumers', biggest complaints: Fragmentation. Instead of feigning excitement about many of the relatively minor updates Google choose to focus on, us regular people could have been excited about the new iOS-like version of the Android ecosystem. Consider that according to Apple, 79 per cent of iOS devices are on the latest version, iOS 10. Developers know they can take advantage of the coolest iOS features because the majority of users will be have access to those features. Like when Swiftkey and other third party keyboard apps launched alongside iOS 8, the iOS version that allowed for third party keyboards. Third party keyboard makers could immediately take advantage of the iOS 8 feature because they knew that had a guaranteed enormous audience. That simply wouldn't be possible today with Google. Yet when Project Treble goes live with Android O later this year that will be possible. iOS's biggest competitor is closing a major gap between them. Too bad no one at Google I/O knew about it. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments projectkennedy @projectkennedy May 19, 2017, 2:02pm I have an S6 Edge (bought outright, no carrier dramas) and only just got updated to Nougat this week. You'd think it being not carrier branded would help but who knows. It's always hard to find any good information about when updates are coming, and by the time they come, I have forgotten what the new features I'm supposed to be excited about because it's been almost a year since the new version was announced. It's getting a bit frustrating. My partner has a motorola and you would have thought they'd be more in sync with google but nope. He is still waiting for Nougat...

We spoke to some of Australia's premier porn performers and producers.

Here are all the Instant Apps announced at Google I/O Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 2:36pm PDTMay 18, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 74 Share on Facebook 57 Share on Twitter Total Shares159 Google News Instant apps were announced one year ago at Google I/O 2016, but only now are they rolling out to a large amount of users. Now any developer can make instant apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

If you were already using them, you'd have them installed and have no need for an instant app. boop I've yet to figure out how instant apps work. DieselBeats Basically the experience of the app without having to download it. It's moreso if you are really only going to use the app once so it's not just hogging up space on your phone and never being used. boop I now that much. I mean I've never been able to pull one up. Sruly J Do you have the Google Play Services for Instant Apps app installed? Michel S. weird, why can't I find that in the Play Store? (on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app?

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on.

Google launches new vitals tools in the Play Console Dashboard to find and solve problems Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/17 2:07pm PDTMay 17, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 13 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares62 Android OS Development Google Videos In one more slice of I/O developer news, Google has launched another set of tools for developers using their Console Dashboard for apps on Google Play . The new tool automatically analyzes app reports to show developers pertinent info about app issues. This is the 2nd big feature about making app performance and bug fixing easier for developers after the new visual profiler tools in the latest preview of Android Studio. Just last month Google updated the developer console to material design. Between that and the announcements today, It's clear that Google wants to try to make things easier for developers. The new tool is part of the developer console for apps published via Google Play, and shows 6 top issues within a category of problems like ANR Rate, Crash Rate, Slow Rendering, etc. Within each issue it also tells you how many users are affected, and offers useful advice on how to fix it. You can check out the help page for the new feature here if you are interested in more precise info, like descriptions of the different categories of data it presents or instructions, but it's pretty simple to use. After selecting your app in the dashboard you can see the new tools on the left in Android Vitals - Overview. If your app has any relevant data collected, it should be there.  Between this and the new visual profiler tools announced, Android developers might have a slightly easier time pinpointing the source of problems and finding solutions.

Ask anyone, however, and they’ll tell you that the most exciting new features Google showed off on stage on Wednesday pertained to Google Assistant. Everyone’s favorite voice-powered assistant is already the most capable one out there, but Google’s enhanced AI and advancements in machine learning are now taking Google Assistant to the next level. Long story short, it’s time to see what all the fuss is about. The Google Home smart speaker is the best and most convenient way to access all of the awesome features Google Assistant has to offer, and it’s on sale right now on Amazon at the lowest price we can find. In fact, if you don’t need Prime shipping, scroll to the “other sellers” section on the Amazon product page and you can get it for even less. Here’s a quick blurb from Google: Google Home is powered by the Google Assistant. Ask it questions. Tell it to do things. And with support for multiple users, it can distinguish your voice from others in your home so you get a more personalized experience. It’s your own Google, just for you.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home can now integrate with GE, LG, Whirlpool appliances By Ida Torres - May 18, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you’re still on the fence about whether Google Home will be a great buy for a home like yours that has many smart appliances, the announcement from Google I/O today should finally convince you. Whereas the smart speaker was connected only to small brands before, now you have three major brands integrating their various appliances with support for Google Assistant. GE, LG, and Whirlpool smart appliances can now be connected to the Google Home speaker you’ll be buying soon enough. GE Appliances says it’s one of the first major appliance manufacturers to have their full suite connected to Google Assistant. Using their Geneva Home skill, users can ask Google to connect to it in order to do things like make hot water, set the oven timer, ask if the dishes are clean, and other things. The command has to go something like, “OK Google, ask Geneva Home to preheat the oven to 350 degrees.” Meanwhile, over at LG, their Signature home appliances are the first in the lineup to be integrated with Google Assistant and Google Home. This includes the LG Signature Washing Machine, InstaView Refrigerator, air conditioner, and air purifier among others. Some other connected appliances under the LG brand like the LG Hom-Bot Turbo+ and LG smart air conditioner will also get the integration. They plan to add more products later on. Lastly, Whirlpool is another brand that is introducing the integration to more than 20 of their Jenn-Air and Whirlpool brands which includes ovens and ranges, microwaves, refrigerators, dishwashers, etc. Users will be able to “talk” to these appliances using their Google Home smart speaker and let Google Assistant do all the “work”.

Lowe's Mobile by Scott Stein May 18, 2017 5:21 PM PDT @jetscott On-screen directions show you where the paint is when you hold up your phone. And how to get there. Maybe, even, remember where you shopped last. Lowe's hardware stores have already been experimenting with indoor mapping via Google Tango, and now 400 stores will be indoor-mapped in the future. Google Tango is a camera for phones that adds advanced augmented reality, but its real killer app is indoor mapping. At Google's I/O developer conference, a new Visual Positioning Service beta was announced that will accurately map indoor places into persistent 3D maps, no Wi-Fi or GPS required. Google Tango will change how you shop Lowes is testing an augmented reality experience which uses Google's Tango technology to help you find things faster in stores. by Lexy Savvides 1:59 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF A few museums like Detroit's Institute for the Arts are already experimenting with advanced indoor mapping and augmented reality exhibits, interacting with virtual diagrams alongside the real artifacts. Lowe's stores will focus on helping shoppers get to what they're looking for faster. VPS could eventually be a way to assist in any indoor space and help give directions at public places, underground, or anywhere else. Lowe's stores might be one of the biggest testbeds yet for trying it in a live public setting. Currently, a few Lowe's stores already using this mapping technology can let shoppers borrow a Tango phone to try the service -- which is necessary, since only two phones (the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, and the upcoming Asus Zenphone AR) can take advantage of the in-store augmented mapping. But, considering Lowe's stores sell Tango-enabled phones like the Phab 2 Pro, it's not a bad way to do an in-store demo of what Tango can do.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google this week released the first public beta of Android O, the next version of its core mobile platform. Android O has a handful of interesting new features, including picture-in-picture, notification dots, autofill for app logins, easy text selection, and much more. Android O may not be huge on hallmark additions to the platform, but it shows an excellent level of refinement from Google. We downloaded the Android O beta and took it for a quick spin. Here are our first impressions of this super early build of Android O. AD       article continues below... Android O will replace Android Nougat later this year, but if you're anxious to run the latest code from Google the initial public beta is now available. Google talked about a number of new features for the platform, but there are seemingly fewer user-facing changes than in previous new versions of Android. Android O Beta First, just about anyone can download and install the Android O beta. You'll need a Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, or Nexus 5X in order to install the new bits. Go to Android.com/beta to register your device. Once enrolled, wait a few moments and check the phone's system updater. The new OS should appear shortly. If you're on a Pixel coming from Android N, you can expect the download to be about 920MB. Be sure to perform the install over wifi. Picture-In-Picture Google touts PiP as one of the most significant new features headed to Android O, but I'm not all that turned on by it. First, PiP has been available to Android tablets since last year, and the implementation demonstrated by Google isn't much more exciting than split-screen multitasking. Basically, video or other media apps can minimize into a small window that will float on top of another app in use. Pic-In-Pic To start, only Chrome and YouTube support PiP at the moment. The feature is still nascent. The controls are there to implement it, but I couldn't get it to work at all. I can only assume I have a buggy build on my Pixel XL. Others attending Google I/O in Mountain View this week has similar difficulty getting PiP to work. PiP Notifications One of the biggest changes coming to Android O concerns notifications. Google is taking a page from competing platforms to improve how notifications work for both developers and end users. The most obvious change is what Google calls notification dots. In Android O, apps that have new, unread notifications will now show a small red dot in the upper right corner of the app shortcut. This provides an obvious visual cue to people about notifications. Notification Dot Moreover, a long press of app shortcuts on the home screen will call up a notification panel that details the newest message or other unread content. Even better, you can dismiss the notification from this new panel. Notifications Last, Android O will let people take more control over how notifications alert them, including the notification light, vibrations, sounds, and so on. Google says adopting this new style of notifications will be mandatory for all apps running on Android O and up. Notification Controls Widgets Android O makes it easier to discover and drop widgets on your home screen. A long press of any app shortcut on your home panel brings up the new notification and control window. A small icon in the upper right corner gives you instant access to that particular app's widgets. Press it and you'll see the available widgets at the bottom of the screen. Select the one you want, drag it to the home screen, and voila, new widget. Widget Tool Widgets   Widgets Widgets Quick Settings Shade The Quick Settings shade has a new look and feel. Google changed up the fonts and and colors a bit to refresh the appearance some. The basics remain the same, meaning you can arrange the settings toggles any way you wish. Quick Settings Perhaps most helpful, pulling down the Quick Settings shade will toggle the battery tool to show the percentage of battery life left. Battery Percentage Settings Similar to the Quick Settings shade, the full settings menu has been give a new coat of paint. You'll see less white and more gray in the background. Accent colors have shifted to a new blue that I find rather appealing. The settings menus are also stuffed with new options. For example: the nightlight function has a new control slider; the battery saver now requires fewer clicks to activate; a new dashboard makes it easier to see what devices your phone is connected to; and security tools let you more easily find your phone, see its security patch level, and new the status of your apps. Settings   One thing I'm bummed about: Android O appears to do away with the handy settings switcher that's in the upper left corner of Android Nougat. It's possible Google will add the tool back in in subsequent beta builds of Android O. Emoji The native Android emoji have been ugly, jellybean-shaped blobs for several years now. I hate them. Thank goodness that changes with Android O. Google has adopted a more traditional design for its emoji, which are now round as they are on most other platforms. Emoji It's worth pointing out that Google's phone-making partners, such as Samsung, typically include their own emoji on smartphones. In other words, this change impacts mostly (only?) those who use the stock Android experience on their handset. In other words, Nexus and Pixel owners have something to be happy about. Emoji   Odds and Ends Many of the other features mentioned by Google for Android O aren't quite working yet. For example, the Text Selection tool isn't functional. Google says the vast majority of text that's highlighted by end users is phone numbers, addresses, and business names. I couldn't get this to work in the Android O Beta, so it must not be activated. The same is true of Autofill, which requires an API for developers to enable in their apps. Ditto for the adjustable app icons for the home screen. Surely Android O has lot more hiding under the hood, but this is what we were able to glean after just a little while with the refreshed platform. Surely we'll have more to say as Google updates and finalizes Android O for everyone.

Zeman   @phonescooper Google this week rolled out the Google Payment API, a new set of capabilities that will allow anyone to make in-app or online payments with any debit or credit card associated with their Google account. Google says this option will simplify the process for people to checkout and make purchases online, as it negates the need to fill out cumbersome purchasing forms. Moreover, the API will make it possible for people to send or receive payments via the Google Assistant. Whether the Assistant is accessed through a smartphone or Google Home, users can say, "Ok Google, send $10 for Jane for pizza" and Google will do exactly that. A separate payment tool for developers, called the Card Linked Offers API, smoothes over the process of supporting loyalty cards and programs. It gives developers a new channel for interacting with customers and rolling out targeted offers. From a consumer standpoint, it will be far easier to add loyalty cards to Android Pay once developers update their app with the Card Linked Offers API. Google expects these capabilities to roll out later this year. more info at Google » Related Android Pay Can Be Used for App-Based Purchasing Google today added to Android Pay's capabilities, making it possible to use Android Pay when making purchases within select Android apps.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares106 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot.

When you get it, there will be a few more goodies that Google's didn't see fit to talk about. It turns out there is a full editable history of what you say to Assistant. Prior to this change, Assistant would only show you queries from your current session. Close Assistant, and it was all gone the next time you called up Assistant. With the typing input, you can also scroll way back and see your old questions and answers. We don't know how far back it goes yet—the feature only just rolled out. Left: editing a query, Right: the old Assistant look for reference Additionally, you can long-press on any exchange and either edit or delete it. If you delete it, Assistant warns you the data is useful for crafting better answers in the future, so you shouldn't make a habit of it. Editing lets you tweak the query by typing, and then you can send it to get a different answer. Thanks: Łukasz Ordon Tags assistant Google io17 io2017 subscribe ...

At its annual Google I/O conference on Wednesday, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announced a slew of helpful updates rolling out over the next few days that will make the already superior Google Photos app even better, particularly for iPhone users who snap and manage a ton of pics on their devices. (And let’s face it, there are a lot of us.) Here are just a few reasons why iPhone users should seriously consider shelving Apple Photos and giving Google Photos a shot: Unlimited storage Storage capacity is a real issue for Apple Photos if you want to back up your pics to the cloud. Apple’s iCloud gives users the first 5 gigabytes of monthly cloud storage for free, but wants them to pony up $.99 for 50 gigabytes, $2.99 for 200 gigabytes, and $9.99 for a whopping 1 terabyte. Not so with Google Photos, which offers unlimited storage. Sure, you have to be fine with your images being saved at a maximum of 16 megapixels. But unless you’re someone like famed photographer Annie Leibovitz, you probably don’t care or won’t notice the difference. The camera on my iPhone 6S Plus, for instance, is of the 12 megapixel variety, so this is a non-issue for me, as well as the millions of other likeminded iPhone owners out there.   Smarter Artificial Intelligence At Google I/O, Google said it was no longer a “mobile-first” company but an “AI-first” company. That may sound like eye-rolling marketing speak, but it’s true when it comes to Google Photos, at least. While Apple Photos and Google Photos both use AI to power face detection, Google Photos is simply more accurate. Case in point, while Google Photos identifies my face in all my photos, as well, me, Apple Photos grouped photos with my face into three distinctly different people. (See below.) View photos For some reason, Apple Photos has grouped photos with my face into three distinctly different groups.More Google Lens Think of Google Lens, a new feature, as image recognition on steroids. It uses AI to understand what’s happening in a photo and then serves up related actions to take based on that. For example, Google Lens could identify the restaurant in a photo and display some information about it pulled from online reviews and operating hours. It may also serve up options like loading up Google search results, Google Maps directions, and calling up the place. Apple Photos, at the moment, doesn’t do any of that. This is probably only the start of what is, essentially, a more intelligent Google Photos. During Wednesday’s conference keynote, Google demonstrated it’s already possible to remove large unwanted obstructions in a photo like a fence. And while Google hasn’t said such a feature is coming down the pike, it seems like only a matter of time that users will have the ability to remove items from their images with a simple finger tap. Suggested Sharing Google doesn’t think you share photos enough. To wit, another new feature, Suggested Sharing, helps automate the process of sharing photos by examining who you already share photos with, and then offers recommendations based on that. Suggested Sharing can also detect the people in your photos and then suggest sharing those photos with them either inside the app or with a text or web link. Read More Those features, taken all together, make for a better experience with Google Photos — something I never thought I’d say as a longtime Apple (AAPL) iPhone user.

That's not stopping everyone from trying, however, and Google is taking another crack with a redesigned Android TV homescreen, courtesy of Android O. I got a chance to get up close with the new Android TV homescreen at Google IO 2017, taking place in the open air of the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California this week. To see the O-inspired design, I had to go inside, of course, and hole up in a climate-controlled white dome where I went face-to-face with a new homescreen that's said to be designed around how you actually discover and consume content, not how Google or anyone else thinks you'll do those things.  The new homescreen likely won't convince you to run and grab an Android TV set-top box or supported TV, but it is a change over its predecessor. For some, that change will be welcome. For others, the new UI easily straddles the line into information overload, with the potential for confusion high. How to download Android O right now The homescreen's aim is to put content front and center, surfacing TV shows, movies and video clips you're likely to watch from within categories that make sense to house them. It's also designed to reduce the steps it takes to get to that content.  The current Android N homescreen for Android TV is comprised of three rows: search on the top, followed by recommended content from every app on the Android TV, then the apps themselves. Simple enough, right? Yes and no. With only three rows dealing with the big stuff, you have to scroll through the recommended content to find what you're looking for, or go into an app to access content. The content and apps are mixed together, creating what could be a seem like a jumble that's hard to parse through, and may serve up nothing you're actually in the mood to watch. Android TV's homescreen with Android N With Android O, Google has introduced a new way to organize content on the Android TV. This is through channels, or dedicated rows for each app or content category. A channel can be something like Netflix, on-demand content, or clips from YouTube.  Organized into rows, the channels let you access shows, movies, and clips from a specific source. This closely resembles a TV guide, which pulls up a list of channels when you press that button on your remote.   This TV guide-look may be a welcome dose of familiarity for some and an organizational framework that makes sense, but for others, particularly those who've grown used to modern smart TV interfaces, you may feel the content you want to watch is buried within a channel, never to be found. 8 sure signs Android Oreo is the name Different channels to choose from We can only know this for sure with extended use, but the possibility exists for you to be so overwhelmed by apps and content, that you simply stick to the same three or four apps and categories to get your entertainment fix.  This may be what you do anyway, but if Google's aim is to help people watch more content in more apps - which is a story Google wants to sell to developers, too - this new homescreen may be counter to that cause. You do have control over how many channels you see and what order they are in. There are no limits to how many channels you can have on your homescreen, though manufacturers will choose which channels to include on your TV when it ships. Once you've got your TV set up, you can take out, put in and shuffle apps and other categories as you like.   On the homescreen, publishers can use a static image (most were in our demo) to show off their content in a channel, or a live trailer. With these, you're basically watching the cinematic teaser for a piece of content, but it adds a little dynamism to the experience.  The new homescreen is attractive, and has an updated look over the old UI. It may not be for everyone, but Google does have one other ace in the hole it hopes convinces you to try Android TV out. Google Assistant on the TV This would be Google Assistant. While the digital AI helper wasn't enabled on the Android O television in our demo, another TV running Android Nougat and hooked up to a Nvidia Shield (2017) and a Google Home had Assistant primed for user queries.  With Assistant, you can naturally search for content using prompts such as "Show me Jimmy Kimmel interviewing Winona Ryder". Assistant will pull up every available clip of Jimmy ever interviewing Winona from YouTube, and you can take your pick. Showing off its smarts, if you say, "Play Stranger Things," Assistant will pull up the wildly popular Netflix show, starting right where you left off the last time you watched it. Assistant will also recognize if you say "that" or "it" instead of a specific TV show or move name, using contextual awareness to figure out what it is you're referring to. But Assistant's smarts don't stop with content, and this is seemingly what sets it apart from normal voice search.  You can also ask how long it will take you to get to work if you've spent too much of your morning catching up on NCIS, and Assistant will give you an ETA using information from Google Maps. Ask Assistant if you need an umbrella, and you get a readout of the weather. And if connected to your home's Philip Hue light bulbs, Assistant will turn them on and off. Here's how Daydream VR just got even better We already know Google Assistant on iPhone is a game changer, but it's less clear if it will be the same for Android TV. Yes, you get more information that could be useful in your daily life, but taking the leap to asking our television how long it will take to get somewhere or updates on the weather is a further one to make than doing so on our phones.  Or are we that glued to our television screens, it makes sense? Maybe I'm in denial. That's not to say Google Assistant won't be a well-used feature for Android TV owners, but rather if it will be enough to take the Android TV platform from its middling status to a smart TV platform to beat.  The new homescreen for Android TV is a sizeable change over the current iteration, and if you're curious if and when your screen will get it, here's your answer: any television running Android O and higher will see the new homescreen, but Android O likely won't be available for a few more months.  Google still hasn't decided if televisions running operating systems below Android O will receive the new homescreen, so sit tight if you aren't planning to upgrade.   The changes Google has made to the Android TV homescreen aren't earth-shattering, but they are different. For some Android TV owners, it may be easier to find more shows because you're not scrolling through content recommended from every source. For others, because you don't have that cream-of-the-crop content right in your view, the task of going through all your channels to find something worth watching could be too tedious. The new homescreen does include recommendations based on recently watched content, but again, you may end up watching movies, shows and clips from the same few sources.  One last note: Android O on the phone brings a number of performance enhancements, and we could see some carry over to the TV in due time. Perhaps, as with Android on mobile, Android TV is turning a new leaf, beginning with the homescreen. Nick Pino contributed to this report Don't miss any of the news from Google IO 2017!

Rather impressed by what Microsoft is doing with Outlook on the web? A little bit spooked by how much data Mountain View has on you? Whatever your reasons for splitting up with Google, here's how to make sure it's a clean and uncomplicated break. Image: Google/Pixabay/Gizmodo Get Your Data Out Google Takeout is simple and easy to use. Image: Screenshot To give Google some credit, it makes it easy to get your data out — you can even find everything you need in one place. The service you're after is called Google Takeout. Follow that link, and you'll be asked to sign in with your Google credentials, and then to pick the services you want to download data from. Almost all things Google are listed here, from your videos in YouTube to your browsing history in Chrome. The tool allows you to retrieve data even from lesser-known Google services, such as Google Groups and Google Fit. The only exception that we could spot is Google Play Music. Download your MP3s separately using the desktop Music Manager. You get an email when your download is ready. Image: Screenshot Once you've chosen the archive format and delivery method, then click Create archive. Google will send you an email when the archive is ready to download (if you've chosen to download it), and you can then unpack the files on your computer at your leisure. Archive formats might take a little tinkering to be readable on the other end. Gmail messages, for example, are saved in the .mbox format, which can be imported into Thunderbird, Apple Mail, and various other clients. If the client or service you're switching to doesn't support .mbox files, use POP to download all your Gmail messages instead. Enable it in Gmail settings, then follow Google's instructions to set up your email app of choice. In another example, YouTube videos, reappear in the format you uploaded them in, together with an HTML file holding the attached comments. Bookmarks from Chrome are exported in an HTML file too, so you can easily open them up and store them in whatever web browser you decide to switch to. We would of course recommend double-checking all of your archives before actually getting rid of your Google account, just to make sure all the important stuff is successfully exported and saved. Chrome OS users, do you know where your files are? Image: Screenshot If you're a heavy Google Drive user you can deploy the desktop clients to sync everything to your Windows or macOS computer as an alternative to using Takeout, though the advantage of using Google's official export service is that it will convert all your Docs, Sheets, and Slides on the web to other formats (like Word documents or PDFs). Should there be a Chromebook somewhere in you mix of gadgets, don't forget to have a look at the local download folder on the actual laptop to make sure there are no files there that you can't live without. Once your Google account is gone, you're going to get booted from all Google services that need a login, including Chrome OS. Remember to take good care of your data while it's being transferred somewhere new — you don't want your entire digital existence to get wiped if your laptop gets stolen or lost while you're switching from Google services to the alternatives. Delete Your Google Account So long, Google. Image: Screenshot Google's reach spans many, many services and apps, but fortunately for us, deleting your account can sever ties with all of them in one quick blow. You don't have to dig through them all separately, deleting as you go. In fact, getting rid of your Google account and everything in it is surprisingly easy. Start at your Google account page, click Delete your account or services, then choose Delete Google Account and Data. (Some services, like Gmail and YouTube, can be erased separately if you want to keep your main account.). From there you'll be presented with a review of all the data that's going to go, some tick boxes to check to acknowledge that you are of sound mind and really do want to delete your account, and you can then click Delete Account to wipe everything Google holds on you. Google has more on the process here. Note that you'll lose everything you've ever bought from Google Play, from apps to movies, and you'll also lose your Gmail username, which you can't use again. Google says you've got 2-3 weeks to change your mind if you want to recover your account, and you'll be asked to answer some security questions to verify your identity before Google finally pulls the plug. Find Some Alternatives DuckDuckGo searches the web but doesn't track you. Image: Screenshot Once you've successfully extricated yourself and your data from Google's clutches, your next step is finding new tools for your all your email, search, photo storage, and video-watching needs. There's more choice out there than you might think. For search, where Google makes its money, the obvious big-name alternative is Bing from Microsoft, but the ultra-clean, ultra-private DuckDuckGo is absolutely worth a look as well. If you're no longer going to use Gmail, then you can switch Microsoft's Outlook, Apple's iCloud, or even Yahoo Mail. Apple's email option is ad-free, and of course, simple to use if you're going to switch to iPhone as your mobile phone of choice. iPhone life is pretty much unavoidable if you want to cut the Google cord. While you can use an Android phone without a Google account, you won't be able to download any new apps until you sign in, which limits your options somewhat. Firefox is a good choice if you're ditching Chrome. Image: Screenshot As for desktop apps, ditching Google Chrome is easy enough: Firefox and Opera are excellent alternatives, and even Apple Safari and Microsoft Edge have their upsides. For your mapping needs you can switch to products from Apple or Microsoft, or give the consistently impressive Here Maps a go. Your photos and videos will of course be very important to you, and we've previously written a full guide to switching from Google Photos to Apple Photos. If you're not running into the open arms of Apple for your photo management needs, Flickr is still worth considering, and Microsoft's OneDrive will do the basics as well. Apple and Microsoft have online productivity apps you can switch to. Image: Screenshot Microsoft can also help you out if you're heavily invested in Google's online office suite: Basic versions of Excel, PowerPoint, and Word are available online, as are Apple's productivity programs. Of the independent services, Zoho is probably the best option, though it's focused on businesses rather than on individuals. While we can't give you detailed step-by-step guides for getting your ex-Google data into all these products, in most cases it's pretty straightforward, and you should now have a good idea where to start in each area. WATCH MORE: Tech News Comments Erebus @erebus May 19, 2017, 10:43am So the alternatives is to use all the Apple or Microsoft services... There's probably an alternative article floating around on "complete guide to dumping Apple" And then Yahoo is even listed as an alternative email client! The company that has had major breaches and not told its users until months later. Reply 0 vangrat @vangrat May 19, 2017, 10:57am wait...so you want us to ditch google for microsoft...or apple...or another corporate entity...because of privacy. This article is...insane. MS/Apple/ANY corporate entity, that offers free whatever is going to gather data on their users, because the users aren't the customer, the customers are the ad agencies, and other companies that want to buy user information. So, if you go into any of these services with this in mind, really in the end it doesn't matter which one you use, as they ALL do the same thing. Reply 1 death_au @death_au May 19, 2017, 12:19pm Calm down dude. The opening paragraph offers suggestions of why people might want to move from Google, but it's not the point of the article. The point of the article is you've already decided to move from Google, here's how to do so. It doesn't matter which you use, you are right. If you decide to ditch Google anyway though, this article can help you. Reply 1 targeting compoita @poita May 19, 2017, 1:17pm Apple is definitely on the other side of the fence to Google, they don't collect and sell user data, and are pretty heavily invested on personal privacy, even to the extent of it limiting Siri somewhat. You can opt in to collect usage data/crash data etc. if you wish, but of all the companies, Apple appears to be the most serious about not making the customer a product to sell to other corporations. Reply 0 bigatom @bigatom May 19, 2017, 11:14am If privacy is a concern (and it should be) get yourself a NAS most of them come with all the features these companies offer. Reply 0 myreply @myreply May 19, 2017, 12:33pm I'm always interested by these comments... I completely agree with you, though there's definitely a trade-off between what level of privacy you're willing to sacrifice in the name of life convenience. ie. accurate targeting of products and services you'd be interested in etc. Reply 0 bigatom @bigatom May 19, 2017, 12:55pm Indeed, you pay for convenience with privacy. The level of trade-off is ever increasing with all services being integrated and connected which is by design to a) make them more convenient and b) get more of your data. But you have to know it's not just targeting products/services at you. They use the collected data to build their AI for all sorts of things, playing the stock exchange for one.

 A top Microsoft exec on working with Apple, competing with Google's Chromebooks, and the future of Windows Matt Weinberger May 18, 2017, 7:44 PM 2,624 facebook linkedin twitter email print Microsoft Corporate VP of Windows Joe Belfiore on stage at Build 2017 in Seattle, Washington. Microsoft Microsoft has been busy lately. At its Build developer conference last week, the software giant announced Windows 10 would be getting new integrations with Android and iPhone. Earlier this month, it unveiled a new Surface Laptop along with a new version of its flagship operating system — dubbed Windows 10 S — to power it. Oh, and next week Microsoft is expected to unveil a new Surface tablet. The moves are all connected, Microsoft CVP of Windows Joe Belfiore, who also serves as an advisor to the company's education business, told Business Insider at the Build conference last week. People use different types of devices, not just Windows PCs, Belfiore said. If Windows wants to win, it has to play nicely with non-Windows gadgets like iPhones and Android smartphones. Meanwhile, Windows 10 S's mission is to win over tech-savvy students, who are already living this PC-plus-smartphone lifestyle. "Thematically, this is us jumping in to support this multi-device world," Belfiore said. In the interview, Belfiore talked about competing with Google, improving the Windows Store, and how Microsoft convinced Apple to make a new version of iTunes for its app marketplace. Microsoft Surface Laptop is a $999 device showing off the new Windows 10 S operating system. AP Versus Google A big reason for the success of Google's Chromebooks is they're cheap and easy for schools to manage. And because the Chrome OS is little more than the Chrome web browser in a fancy shell, they punch above their weight performance-wise and don't get bogged down by software running in the background. This speaks to a historical weakness for Windows. Back in 2007, an anonymous Microsoft executive infamously referred to the pre-installed software on new Windows PCs as "craplets" — junk that slows your computer down and makes its performance degrade over time. And while it's something that's certainly gotten better, that kind of "software rot," as it's called, is still a problem. Belfiore is kinder than the exec of a decade ago — PC manufacturers are "well intentioned," he said, and merely trying to pre-load useful apps for their customers. Still, going forward, he'd like Windows 10 devices to "appear to all their customers as highly reliable and high performance and non-degrading." Google Chromebooks, like this Acer-made model, are low-cost laptops designed to deliver a web browser and little else. Acer Windows 10 S is meant to address take a step in that direction and offer an experience comparable to Chrome OS. It checks off many of the same boxes — faster boot-up time, easy IT department management, and no software rot. Windows 10 S devices will run as smoothly on day 100 as on day 1, Microsoft likes to say. And it'll be available on sub-$300 laptops. But unlike Chromebooks, those Windows 10 S laptops, which are targeted at the education market, will sport all the benefits of Windows — including full versions of Microsoft Office, the familiar Start menu interface, and soon, enhanced support for all the devices they're already using. The big tradeoff All of those benefits in Windows 10 S do come with a notable cost. To ensure that no viruses, malware or pernicious "craplets" affect system performance and ruin your experience, Microsoft will only let Windows 10 S users install software they've downloaded from the Windows Store. Unfortunately, Microsoft's app market lacks several of the most popular apps and lags far behind Apple's App Store or Google Play in the total number of apps available. But it's only a matter of time before the store reaches its full potential, Belfiore said. Windows 10 isn't yet two years old, and as it grows, it's going to attract more apps to the store, he argued. "Windows 10 is pretty young," he said. "You've got to have scale to get engagement."  Microsoft CVP of Windows Joe Belfiore on stage at Microsoft Build 2017 in Seattle, Washington. AP Photo/Elaine Thompson Windows 10 S will play an important role in Microsoft trying to reach that scale, Belfiore said. Because it's going into schools, which Microsoft sees as a growth market, it could get a lot of young, app-savvy customers using Windows. And because Windows 10 S only lets users download apps from the Windows Store, developers who want to reach those students might be convinced to start making apps for it. That dynamic explains why Apple recently decided to list iTunes in the Windows Store, Belfiore said. In order for students using Windows 10 S to be able to buy music or movies from iTunes or access the Apple Music streaming service, it needed to work with Microsoft to get the full version of iTunes into the Windows Store.  So while Windows Store may be an also-ran today, its ability to attract apps like iTunes and Spotify is a sign of things to come, he said.  "We're starting to get to the tipping point," Belfiore said.   Get the latest Google stock price here.

Google's computer vision will soon be able to automatically remove obstructions in photos Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/17 10:37am PDTMay 17, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares177 Google News Google I/O is underway one of the first topics covered was the great strides the company has made in image recognition software. Further improvements in computer vision are enabling Google products to see the attributes behind the picture and break them down into constituent parts. This is powered by machine learning and capable of some incredible image editing feats. In the example used by Google CEO Sundar Pichai on stage during his keynote, we see an image of a girl playing baseball taken from behind a wire fence. Using Google's AI, he then removes the fence in a snap, getting rid of the obstruction and leaving behind only what's important. Before. After. While the example maybe looks a little bit strange at first, this could be a really useful tool for those less technically advanced (like me) wanting to edit photos quickly. The I/O keynote is happening right now if anyone wants to jump in and see what else Google has up its sleeve. Tags computer vision Google image recognition io17 io2017 video subscribe ...

Nick Coad That makes literally no sense in the context of this article. Marcus Can it remove my brother's ex-girlfriend from my wedding photos? Kostas 💪🎩 Tell yourself she is just a stranger and move on 🦄 whispy_snippet This is kinda like Photoshop's content aware feature... but for the masses. Incredible. JG On a related note... Wasn't Google (or some other company?) working on a means to remove reflections from images (like pictures taken behind a tour bus window)? I think they (or someone) was working on it a few years back. Don't seem to recall hearing anything beyond the "Hey this is what we're doing" announcement. mike shwilly Microsoft has an app to take a picture without any obstructions. But you have to stand and wait until everything goes out of the shot JG You have to wait until everything goes out of the shot... Wouldn't that work for any camera then? Coincidentally, I recently stumbled upon an article from LifeHacker or a similar site explaining how to remove tourist from your photos. Their suggested approach, take several photos, 5-10 seconds apart. Then load said photos into PhotoShop and select the mean tool/option. As long as no one stops and stand in the same spot for to long/in too many photos, you should get a picture of just the statue or church or whatever. Nick Coad I remember the article you're thinking of. I think it was purely academic, I don't think it was planned as an actual app. But yeah, I'd love to see that appear in an app somewhere too! abc Is that real, or did they simply take a photo without the fence and claim their software removed it? Imparus It is real, the question is how it will handle more complex stuff, like say if there were people instead of a forest behind the fence, that one would be much more difficult to fix. Nick Coad There's nothing remotely hard to believe about the example posted here, it's pretty well understood (but still very, very cool) technology at the moment. It's limited only by the amount of data it can consume in order to learn how to accurately fill in blanks in images, of which Google likely has the most, which is why this is potentially exciting. Like the other commenter, @Imparus:disqus, has said though: the real test will be how it handles more complex backgrounds with less predictable areas to fill in.

When you get it, there will be a few more goodies that Google's didn't see fit to talk about. It turns out there is a full editable history of what you say to Assistant. Prior to this change, Assistant would only show you queries from your current session. Close Assistant, and it was all gone the next time you called up Assistant. With the typing input, you can also scroll way back and see your old questions and answers. We don't know how far back it goes yet—the feature only just rolled out. Left: editing a query, Right: the old Assistant look for reference Additionally, you can long-press on any exchange and either edit or delete it. If you delete it, Assistant warns you the data is useful for crafting better answers in the future, so you shouldn't make a habit of it. Editing lets you tweak the query by typing, and then you can send it to get a different answer. Thanks: Łukasz Ordon Tags assistant Google io17 io2017 subscribe ...

[Update: There will be an unlocked model too] The ZenFone AR will be a Verizon exclusive in the United States Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 12:28pm PDTMay 18, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 17 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares71 ASUS News Verizon Wireless Update 1: 2017/05/18 4:07pm PDT It seems Verizon's press release was misleading. ASUS has confirmed to us that an unlocked model will be available in the United States as well, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. Mobile VR hasn't really taken off, and Google's augmented-reality Project Tango experiment is in the same boat. The first publicly-available phone with Project Tango, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro, launched last year. If you read our review, you'll know that the massive size, poor performance, and price made it hard sell even for VR/AR enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the upcoming Tango-powered ZenFone AR already has a major flaw; it will be Verizon-exclusive in the United States. This seems like a dumb move, as the market for this phone was already incredibly tiny, and now even less people will be inclined to buy it. If you need a refresher, the ZenFone AR was announced back in January with a Snapdragon 821 CPU, up to 8GB of RAM, a 5.7" 1440p display, and Android 7.0. Verizon neglected to announce pricing, but it will be available from Big Red this summer. Update 1: 2017/05/18 4:07pm PDT It seems Verizon's press release was misleading. ASUS has confirmed to us that an unlocked model will be available in the United States as well, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. End of Update Press Release MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today at Google I/O, ASUS announced that Verizon will be the exclusive wireless provider of the ZenFone AR in the United States. The next-generation smartphone represents a significant advancement in mobile virtual and augmented reality technologies. The ZenFone AR is the world's first smartphone that supports both Tango AR and Daydream VR technologies developed by Google, giving users totally new ways to engage with and be entertained by their smartphones. During Google I/O, Johnny Lee, head of the Google Tango team, demonstrated Tango and Daydream on the ZenFone AR. The ZenFone AR will come with the Android 7.0 Nougat OS with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, and will be available this summer at Verizon. Tango is an augmented reality (AR) platform that uses qualified devices to detect their users' positions relative to places and objects around them without using GPS or other external signals. This allows application developers to create AR experiences that include indoor navigation, 3D mapping, and environmental recognition, among other augmented reality applications. Daydream is a high-quality virtual reality (VR) platform that is built into the Android operating system to support VR apps. The ASUS ZenFone AR was developed in close cooperation with Google to deliver the best user experience on both Tango and Daydream platforms. Ideal for AR and VR Tango adds three abilities to the ZenFone AR: motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. Through these capabilities, the ZenFone AR can detect how far it is away from a floor, wall or an object and understand where it is moving in three-dimensional space. AR is a rapidly growing segment for mobile technology and one consumers are extremely excited about. To date, there are over 100 Tango compatible apps on Google Play1. ASUS and Google are also partnering with well-known brands to bring the Tango AR experience to customers. For VR, the large, high-resolution and high-contrast display of the ZenFone AR makes it ideal for VR applications when used as a VR display mounted in the Daydream View headset. The ZenFone AR’s expansive 5.7-inch screen immerses the viewer in whatever VR world is being presented, while the WQHD (1440 x 2560) resolution presents images with extreme clarity and deep black hues enabled by the high-contrast super AMOLED technology which enhances the 3D effect of the screen. Powerful Supporting Hardware To make the ZenFone AR an ideal VR and AR smartphone, it has been designed with the latest top-of-the-line components that also make it one of the most powerful smartphones in the market: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8212 Processor: The Snapdragon 821 processor used by the ZenFone AR has been specially optimized for AR operations. ASUS worked closely with Qualcomm Technologies engineers and Google to efficiently distribute computer vision workloads. Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 GPU: With 6GB of RAM and the desktop-class Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 graphics processing unit (GPU) that delivers supercharged graphics performance, the ZenFone AR handles the visual graphic demands of Tango and Daydream with ease. Superior Hi-Res Audio and DTS Virtual Surround Sound: Complementing the rich AR & VR experiences offered by the ZenFone AR is a new audio system that supports Hi-Res Audio and DTS virtual surround sound. External audio also gets a boost with the ZenFone AR’s new ultra-loud 5-magnet speaker. Photographic Maestro: The ZenFone AR is also an accomplished camera smartphone. It has the same ASUS PixelMaster 3.0 camera system found in the ZenFone AR that comprises of the world's highest resolution Sony IMX318 sensor and TriTech Autofocus system.

Dumb dumb dumb... Corbin Davenport Well, the Pixel/Pixel XL was still available unlocked and on Project Fi. This probably won't be. SyCoREAPER Not on Verizon anymore but at least it isn't another goddamn Motorola device which was pretty much all they offered last I had them raffr Considering google's inability to keep the phone in stock, i think it matters little that verizon is the only carrier selling the Pixel. lomsha Lack of stock doesn't automatically equal crazy demand if they only produce puny amounts. ProductFRED Yeah, and that's a device people actually wanted to begin with... raffr ' This seems like an incredibly dumb move by ASUS.." you are assuming other carriers even wanted to sell this phone! _jsw_ I think the idea is that an unlocked version would likely be at least as likely to sell because, let's face it, this is a developer/early adopter phone, so the more places it can be bought, the more phones they'll sell. Toan Ngo Way to kill adoption! SyCoREAPER Everyone here is assuming this is a great phone, it sounds great. For all you know it's going to be a flop, a Verizon exclusive flop mxwp if the review for the prior phone is any indication SyCoREAPER Same could have been argued for Samsung, but it literally blew up in their face. ha I've got jokes. The point stands though, you never know. Liam Bulkley Specs are wrong. According to your link (and the asus site), the zenfone ar will have a Snapdragon 821 w/8gb ram. No mention of battery, though 5Ah sounds right to me considering how tango needs all the emfs. I hope the next Pixel has tango compatible hardware. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Marty Don't really get the Project Tango significance, but the phone seems to have good specs. Too big for my tastes, though. DrunkSpock Tango is pretty magical actually, I've been doing some development with their devkit a while now. It can place spatially oriented 3D objects into your camera stream with micro-millimeter precision. Fun stuff. Frank King With all those OEMs fighting to come up with special features, I'm kinda surprised there is still so few Tango devices.. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Damn I was interested in this phone. I like AR/VR even if it's a fad right now. Was trying to decide between pixel2, zenfone AR, and the OnePlus 5. As a T-Mobile customer guess my decision got easier. Kenny’s Turtle "This seems like an incredibly dumb move by ASUS, as the market for this phone was already incredibly tiny, and now even less people will be inclined to buy it." Not sure how being sold in the number one mobile network's stores is a dumb move, considering all of their previous phones couldn't even be used on the Verizon network. The Phab 2 Pro has been available to all GSM mobile users since its launch. How are those sales numbers? Maybe a different approach isn't so dumb after all. _jsw_ The P2P is a piece of crap. It wouldn't have sold any more had it been a Verizon exclusive. _jsw_ Is this "exclusively Verizon" in the sense that it will not be available to buy *anywhere* else, or "exclusively Verizon" like the Pixel? "Verizon as the exclusive wireless provider" is ambiguous. Artem Russakovskii Yup, that. Fucking Verizon. _jsw_ Fucking Verizon indeed. I've been waiting for a decent Tango device for so long that I might do shameful things to get this, though. Maybe. Hopefully there will be rumors of a Pixel Tango by the time this comes out. Artem Russakovskii Wait, did you see the update to the post? _jsw_ Um... no. :o Came here directly from the email notification. But, on the other hand, thinking it was confirmed I'd have to get it from Verizon and then finding out that an unlocked model will be available makes it even better! Sometimes being inept pays off! Nathan J Nice to see Asus phones working in the US, but mid-rangers with hardware keys? In 2017? Come on now. Bring premium phones to the US.

Google I/O is ostensibly about the future of Android, but that changed in 2016 when CEO Sundar Pichai put the AI-powered Google Assistant and machine learning at the forefront, a trend that continued at this year's show. At I/O 2017, the phrase "going from mobile first to AI first," was repeated throughout the opening sessions and definitely set the tone. In addition to adding to its collection of open-source neural net technology, Google also introduced a more advanced Tensor Flow Unit (TCU), a piece of hardware designed specifically for running and training neural nets. This technology has been made available to developers and researchers on the cloud, and Google doubled down with 1,000 units available for research organizations. The average consumer, however, will likely experience Google's machine-learning efforts via the Google Assistant. Developers can now build special Actions for this super-powered chatbot, which expands what the Assistant can do. Google unveiled new tools to make interactions like purchases seamless, opening the door for the Assistant to become a money-making platform for developers. In addition to the ascendance of the Assistant, it was interesting to see all the places where mobile phones were absent. A new Android-based, in-car control system highlighted the Assistant, but doesn't require a phone. Google Home is getting a slew of updates, but voice calls don't require a phone; Home will now simply call numbers, for free. It's a startling move, partly because of its convenience but especially because this is exactly the context where we would expect to see crossover with Android devices. Popular Google Platform iPhone One noticable point was the number of times the iPhone was mentioned during the series of keynotes at Google I/O. These weren't offered as points of comparison to show Android's superiority. Instead, Google treated the iPhone almost as if it were another platform for its developers. It started when the Google Assistant debuted in the less-than-popular chat app Allo, which launched simultaneously on iPhone and Android. The Assistant next appeared exclusive in the Pixel and Pixel XL phones, but now the Assistant will be everywhere: in cars, in TVs, and, yes in the iPhone. Now that developers can write Actions for the Assistant, it effectively turns the iPhone into an extension of Google's existing platforms. The Pieces of Android Android isn't going away, clearly. Sessions focusing on the changes coming in Android O highlighted new tools and efforts to make developing for Android easier. But there was also a sense of tension as Google starts to take back more and more control of the Android platform. If developers want to target their apps for the new Android O, they have to use the OS's new notification channels. If not, developers were told in a session, notifications will be dropped. Related The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 Android is also popping up in more places beyond the phone. A stripped-down, hardened version of Android will power Google's IoT platform called Android Things. Several of the changes coming to O regarding power and processor use are also coming to Android Wear, with additional restrictions. The real question is not what the future of Android will be. With 2 billion active monthly users on Android, it's clearly a major player in the Googleverse. Rather, Google is pushing hard to turn Android developers into Google Assistant developers, Google Home Actions developers, and web developers using the latest tools available in Chrome. That transition is going to be key toward Google becoming an AI first company.

From Google's announcement: OS: We're optimizing Android O to run smoothly and efficiently on entry-level devices. Apps: We're also designing Google apps to use less memory, storage space, and mobile data, including apps such as YouTube Go, Chrome, and Gboard. Play: On entry-level devices, Play store will promote a better user experience by highlighting apps that are specifically designed for these devices -- such as apps that use less memory, storage space, and mobile data -- while still giving users access to the entire app catalog. If a device has less than 1 GB of RAM, it will automatically use the Android Go version of Android. In addition, Google has set up a set of guidelines applications must adhere to in order to qualify for the special highlighting mentioned above. The first question that popped into my mind was - why isn't every device getting this supposedly faster, and more lightweight version of Android? Will we be able to 'force' our devices to use Android Go, even if they don't officially qualify? The second question is - why would a developer go the lengths of creating additional versions of their application, instead of what they ought to do, which is slim down their existing application?

Unlike the ubiquitous round emojis displayed on Apple and Android operating systems, Google's version looked like a cross between melted lemon drops and the yellow ghost in Pac Man. The blobs, as they came to be called, are seen on all Google platforms, including Gmail, Google+ and during Google Hangouts. Not only are the shapes different, but users often complained the icons were so small it was difficult to tell what emotion someone was trying to convey -- making it difficult, for example, to tell the difference between the crying emoji and the laugh/crying emoji. Executives said the change was necessary not just because of aesthetics. As emojis become an increasingly common tool for sharing emotions, the difference between Google blobs and other emoji platforms was causing communications breakdowns for users.

The Witcher is becoming a Netflix TV ... HTC is making a new standalone Vive VR headset for Google by Ben Parfitt Thursday, May 18th 2017 at 10:02AM BST Print this page Email Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share on Google Share on LinkedIn The next evolution of VR tech will look to free the headsets from separate hardware. Google has announced that it has partnered to develop two virtual reality headsets that will work as standalone devices. That means they will not have to be plugged into a powerful gaming PC, console or smartphone. Nor will they require that users mount or stand sensors in their rooms. Instead, the headsets will incorporate tech that allows them to trace their position as they move in 3D space. Furthermore, Google has partnered not only with Lenovo but also with HTC – makers of the Steam-friendly HTC Vive – to produce the hardware. It has also been confirmed that Samsung's Galaxy S8 will soon be updated to support the Google Daydream format. Until now Galaxy owners who wanted to dabble in VR were restricted to the Oculus-developed Gear VR. An update to provide both the S8 and S8 Plus with Daydream compatibility is due in the summer. “Daydream will soon also support a new category of VR devices, which we call standalone VR headsets,” Google said. “These devices build on what’s already great about smartphone VR, and they make the whole experience even easier and more comfortable. “Standalone headsets don't require a phone or PC. Instead, getting into VR is as simple as putting the thing on. The hardware is fully optimized for VR, and features a new headset tracking technology called WorldSense. WorldSense enables positional tracking, meaning the headset tracks your precise movements in space – and it does this all without any external sensors to install. “We worked closely with Qualcomm to create a standalone headset reference design, which partners can use as a blueprint to build from. HTC VIVE, a leader in the VR space, and Lenovo, a leader in mobile and computing, are both working on devices, with the first ones coming later this year.” Vive added: “We have been working closely with developers and consumers to define the best VR experiences over the past few years, and are perfectly positioned to deliver the most premium standalone headset and user experience. “More information on Vive’s standalone VR headset will be made available soon, but rest assured it will be simple, easy-to-use and with no cables to connect. Just pick it up, put it on and be fully immersed in your new reality.” Advertisement Tags: google , VR , virtual reality , htc vive Follow us on Related Stories VR Diversity Initiative wants to ensure VR is for everyone May 17th 2017 at 10:49AM HTC Vive now available on finance from £35 a month May 16th 2017 at 12:15PM Half-Life 2 VR has been Greenlit May 16th 2017 at 11:16AM Samsung Gear VR was secretly devised at id Software, ZeniMax claims May 16th 2017 at 10:11AM Opinion - In the zone: lessons from VR May 12th 2017 at 11:00AM Microsoft reveals Windows Mixed Reality motion controllers May 12th 2017 at 10:17AM Get the latest news sent to your inbox Sign up to receive MCV's email news updates and access to other online products and services.

Elyse Betters19 May 2017Speakers All you have to do is ask Google Home to make a call There's actually no setup required, Google says Call anyone for free, including contacts or local businesses You can even dial out with your personal number Calls to the US and Canada are supported at launch Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google just made Google Home a more compelling rival to Echo. Earlier this month, Amazon launched an Alexa calling service, giving Echo users the ability to phone other Echo users and users of the Alexa app. And if you have the new Echo Show, you can even do video calls. Amazon basically made its Echo lineup far superior to Google Home in terms of communication functionality, but now, mere weeks later, Google is leveling the playing field with a "hands-free calling" feature. Here's everything you need to know about calling with Google Home, including how it works and when the feature will be available. Move over, Siri: Google Assistant is officially coming to iPhone Google Lens brings super powers to your phone camera Google Home can now make hands-free phone calls like Amazon Echo Google Home can now give you visual responses on phones and Chromecast How do you make a call on Google Home? During Google I/O 2017, when Google announced the "hands-free calling" feature, executives said all you have to do is ask Google Home to make a call, and it'll connect you. When we asked Google how it works, we were told: "There's actually no setup required, call anyone for free, including personal contacts or local businesses, and even dial out with your personal number when we detect your voice." How does Google Home calling work? Google's Product and Engineering teams are still hammering out the details of the calling feature before it's rolled out to the public, so we do not have a full understanding yet of how it works. When we asked Google support, they neglected to explain how the feature works and said they didn't want to give us any false information. So, as of right now, there's not much we can tell you either. However, Amazon recently rolled out a similar calling feature for its Echo devices - and it requires a quick setup process: You need to Alexa app on your smartphone, and then with the app, you need to confirm your name and phone number as well as enable access to your contacts list. From there, tap the chat bubble at the bottom, and then tap the figure in the upper-right hand corner. Doing so will show a list of your contacts who have the Alexa app or an Echo and are available to call. Tap on a contact to send a call or message. So, if we had to guess, the Home app on your smartphone will also need to verify your name and phone number and enable access to your contacts before it can let you start placing calls on Google Home, though that's just speculation. After all, Google said it supports calling out with a private number, by default, and it will also provide the option to link your mobile number to Google Assistant. If you link your number, Google said it will use it when Home recognise your voice (and thus whomever you call will know the call is coming from you, whereas with a private number, they won't know). Multiple people can connect to one Google Home and call their own personal contacts, as Google Home can distinguish your voice from others. Go here to learn how to set up multiple users on Home. Who can you call with Google Home? You can call any landline or mobile number in the US and Canada completely free, though calls to 911 or 1-900 numbers are not supported on. There's no word yet on whether this feature will come to the UK, though we suspect Google will eventually launch it in other countries. We will keep you posted as we learn more, so be sure to check back here for the latest details. Also, with just your voice, you can call "millions of businesses" in the US and Google, thanks to built-in Google Search on Google Home. You can also call your own personal contacts, as long as your contacts are synced with your Google Account. So, you'll be able to say “Hey Google, call Bob’s Pizza” or “Hey Google, call mom". Go here to learn how to sync contacts with your Google account. How much do calls cost? Calls to the US and Canada are free. When will Google Home calling be ready? While at Google I/O 2017 in May, Google said it would roll out calling to all Google Home owners “over the coming months". Anything else you need to know? Google said it will only support outbound calls at launch due to customer privacy, but it plans to add blocking “in the coming weeks". Want to know more? Check out Google's Support page for more details. Also, call 1-855-971-9121 (in the US) to speak to a Google Home support specialist if you need more more information on the "hands-free calling" feature. If you're in the UK, call 0800 026 1217​.

The latest is a redesign of Assistant’s settings on phones that is starting to widely rollout today. Nintendo Switch The new design is noticeably more compact with no toggles or long descriptions on the main page. Instead, everything is located in its own dedicated screen. Up top is a grouping of Account related settings like Personal info, Payments, and Shared devices. The next is Devices and lists all of your Google Assistant gadgets. Here users can disable Assistant for that device and tweak other specific settings. The last grouping is Services, which includes Home Control, News, My Day, Shopping lists, and the recently added Shortcuts. At the bottom of each screen there is a new Availability section that notes what devices (phones, Home, etc.) the respective feature supports. Actual functionality remains identical, but this design is greatly simplified for users as it does not overload them with multiple options on a single page.

Soon all of you in those countries will be able to chat away with Assistant in your living room (or kitchen or wherever).

Get an Alexa. Trust me. I've had the GH since December​ and it's useless. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, because it wasn't officialy launched in Germany? Using a product in a country wasn't intended for doesn't prove anything.. mustbepbs I'm sorry what? Assume much? I live in the US. Google focuses on features that don't matter at all like telling jokes or singing songs. Instead they ignore basic functions like adding time to timers and creating calendar appointments, while Amazon adds calling and other useful features. Google doesn't give a shit about Home and it shows every month. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm sorry - i thought you were bashing Google for less functions in Germany although it isn't even officially available there like many other people doing it at the moment. abc He's not in Germany. You're a moron. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Come down jerk.. It wasn't obvious that he lives in 'murica. I only hate people in my country who bless Google Home for less functions although it isn't even officially available in Germany. Marcel Mayer so . i have alexa.. but i want it^^ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/db746c8c554302fc4e3201ec48035ea4dca0b5be8c6b83669ec99bea5927ab06.jpg surethom I agree so far Alexa is better than Google home until we have the ability to reduce the base (it's way to much) & the ability to play your own uploaded music my artist or song name which Alex can do from. Day one. Felix ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I will buy it too :) Waited for it for months.. surethom So no update so you can add calender entries or ask Google home to play your uploaded music by artist or song name :( You have to PAY for a subscription to ask for a song by artist or song names. Tiuri Elvander Finally EowynCarter Interesting. Might get one of these Alex No word on whether or not any of the features announced today, let alone the Assistant skills we still don't have in the UK, will actually be a part of this or will it still just be a talking speaker outside of the US? Many99 With Alexa still not in Canada after 2 years being released, I'm buying a Google home anazon you had your chance keithzg At this rare they still might beat 'em :P Álvaro R. I don't get why not spanish... it's already on allo. Franken Beans Ok since this is for other countries that aren't the US. Care to translate "summer" to an actual month? Kievan Al-Hassan Canada and Japan, bout time! keithzg My bet is mid-October. The old Nokia Play 360 I have in my kitchen, hooked up to a Chromecast Audio, is really starting to fail (speakers are actually dying) and I was hoping this'd be out soon enough, but frankly I'll probably just by some UE speaker to replace it at this rate. I mean, for the love of NAFTA it's been long enough, can't they just put them up for sale on the Canadian Google Store today? What's the holdup? (If it's French, just, like, don't sell it in Quebec yet? The Google Store already has certain products excluded from certain provinces and territories, after all.) whispy_snippet You little beauty! Nick Coad Can AP please start using month names so the rest of the world can more easily understand the timeframes involved? "End of summer" doesn't mean a lot to anyone outside the US without having to look up the dates over which summer takes place in the US. Normally not a big deal but this is specifically news for international readers, so it's a bit frustrating. Theuntje Well.. End of the summer is kind of the same for the US as for Europe.. So.. Isn't that the world? Nick Coad I don't want to blow your mind here, but there is a lot more to the world than the US and Europe. (For example Canada, Australia and Japan - more than half of the countries mentioned in this post title...) Theuntje Well.. according to Eurovision Australia is part of Europe.. You really think I'm serious? Andy J To anyone considering it - hold off. We still don't have the ability to use anything it didn't ship with in the UK. We don't have the assistant directory, we don't have multi-user - we can't even say "OK Google, talk to Google IO 17" (well we can - but we get told it can't be done in British English).

Phones, cars, speakers and appliances: Google outlined ambitious plans to take voice assistance everywhere at its Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, Calif. this week. But as the company is bringing voice input to potentially dozens of devices around your home and beyond, it also faces some interesting challenges unique to this new interaction model. For instance: If all of your devices listen, how do they know which one you are talking to? That problem isn’t a mere hypothetical anymore. Google announced this week that its assistant is already installed on over 100 million Android phones and Google Home speakers. The company also announced partnerships with 19 hardware manufacturers and chipset vendors to take its digital assistant beyond its Google Home speaker and mobile phones and launch it on stereo systems, cars and other consumer electronics devices, some of which will be available before the end of the year. Google also launched an app for the assistant on iPhones, where it now directly competes with Apple’s Siri, and gave developers tools to bring the Google Assistant to their own devices and hardware hacks. “Speakers, toys, drink-mixing robots, whatever crazy devices all of you think up,” joked Assistant VP of Engineering Scott Huffmann with his audience of developers at the conference Wednesday. Related Google Home Gets Hands-Free Calling, Free Spotify, HBO Now Support All of these devices will by design answer to the same so-called hot word — “Okay Google” — to jump into action and answer your questions and demands. So how will they know which one should respond? The solution to this problem is to treat voice assistance like a conversation, explained Google Assistant Product Lead Gummi Hafsteinsson during an interview with Variety. As technology prompts users to be more conversational, it also has to get better at participating in these conversations like humans would. When people talk to each other in a group setting, they don’t address each other by name all the time. Instead, we use more subtle cues like eye contact, body language and even personal history to figure out who is talking to whom. Google’s vision for its digital assistant also comes without first names. Instead, you just say “Okay Google,” and the assistant comes to life on phones, Google Homes and other devices. And increasingly, those devices also use cues to figure out whose turn it is to respond to your commands. Google already uses the sensors of your phone for that very purpose, said Hafsteinsson. If the phone is in your hand, chances are you want it to respond. If it has been resting on your desk, you may be talking to your Google Home instead. On the other hand, if you ask Google’s Assistant to send a text message, you are likely addressing your phone, and not the smart speaker in your kitchen. And a request for a Bloody Mary is probably best answered by that (still hypothetical) drink-mixing robot. “It uses context,” Hafsteinsson said about the Assistant’s attempts to answer your requests with the right device. The ultimate goal was to let users seamlessly switch between different input devices simply by analyzing their intent, and the context of their requests, he said. “As you move through different contexts throughout the day, you will be able to continue the same conversation.” Filed Under: Google Google Assistant Google Home Google I/O 2017 Want to read more articles like this one?

The company announced a yet-to-ship new virtual reality headset, and you can now watch YouTube’s VR videos in the same virtual space with other users. There’s also Google’s new visual positioning service for indoor mapping. These developments are interesting, but feel incremental. Even the executive in charge of these efforts, Clay Bavor, on Wednesday penned a Medium post telling readers not to get too anxious in their anticipation for a killer app. “We’re already at a point where millions of people are beginning to enjoy some of what these new developments can offer, but it’s early days,” he said, using a phrase popular with Google executives trying to rein in expectations. He called the technologies, which he refers to together as “immersive computing,” as “nascent.” He drew an analogy to the first mobile phones that appeared in the ’80s, decades before smartphones as we know them. Bavor’s post could be read as defensive. It has the effect of minimizing VR and AR at Google, something counterintuitive for a company that prides itself on creating billion-user apps across disciplines. Minimization seems especially counterintuitive when competitor Facebook has been pretty loud about its own VR efforts, between social VR demonstrations and the high-end Oculus headset. But that’s not all that’s going on here. His framing is in line with Google’s overarching “AI first” narrative, where the boundaries between individual apps and pieces of hardware are fuzzy and everything feeds into one Google that is everywhere.

Such as, information the 2.0 software update for Google Daydream, codenamed Euphrates. There's two particularly interesting features to come in this update. One is that Google's trying to bring a lot more of the phone experience into Daydream. For example, you'll have access to normal phone functions via a 2D panel that can pop up while in VR. So, you can check notifications, see a web browser, and more while in VR. This sounds simple, but I think it's going to be key to mobile VR becoming important. See, I think a fear with mobile VR is potentially that if you use your phone, you run into the issue of, well, not being able to use your phone. If mobile VR an tackle that problem, of making sure that people can enjoy mobile virtual reality without worrying about being disconnected from their phone, then that only helps the potential of Daydream and similar platforms. Arguably, it's a problem that should have been addressed from day one, but technical realities could have impacted that. The other cool feature is that addition of Chromecast support, so you can share your VR experiences with the people around you. VR is cool in part because of the social aspect of watching other people, and sharing the experience. Giving people in social situations the ability to share that with ease is a great thing. Daydream Euphrates is set to hit later this year for all Daydream-capable devices.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Samsung Tablets Overtake the iPad in Western Europe in Q1, While the iPad Captures 50% of Tablets over $750 | Main May 18, 2017 Google Assistant for iOS Can't Match Apple's Integrated Siri Yesterday we posted a report titled "Google Assistant is now Available for iOS and Google Home will be Offering Free Phone Calls within the U.S. and Canada." One of Google's headline catching announcements out of their I/O developer conference yesterday was that Google Assistant was available on iOS. That was met with a lot of cheering. But for Apple maestro Mark Gurman, Google Assistant doesn't hold a candle to Siri on iOS devices.   Gurnman notes in a Bloomberg report today that "Some people think Google's virtual assistant beats Siri in reliability and capability. That may be true on Google's own devices, like the Pixel smartphone, but the Assistant is hobbled on the iPhone."   The bottom line is "the reality for iPhone users is that the Google Assistant will probably never beat Apple Inc.'s Siri on its home turf. That's bad news for the Alphabet Inc. unit, which wants its voice-based technology everywhere."   Gurman Lists Five top reasons for why Siri is better:   1. You have to download it from the App Store. 2. You can't launch it with your iPhone's home button or with your voice 3. You can't tap into basic iPhone functions and settings 4. You can't launch apps, search some Apple content stores, or pull up photos 5. You can't integrate with other non-Google apps on your iPhone 6. Integrated Apple services typically require an extra step 7. You can't easily use it in the car   Mark concludes that "Altogether, unless you are deeply in the Google ecosystem, using Google Assistant on the iPhone is a pain compared to Siri." For Gurman's full reasoning behind each of his seven points, check out the full Bloomberg report here.   Though to be fair, Android fans that may own a Chromebook, a Samsung tablet and an Apple iPhone for instance, Google Assistant will find a friend who's more familiar with Google Assistant and knows that over time Google's engineers will fix most of the short comings that Gurman has amply and glaringly pointed out. But for most Apple fans, having access to Google Assistant isn't really that appealing to begin with.   To make that point crystal clear, it was reported today that "data released in a research note this week from investment banking-giant, Morgan Stanley, approximately 92 percent of current iPhone owners who are either 'somewhat' or 'extremely' likely to upgrade to a newer smartphone during the next 12 months will upgrade to a new iPhone over any other handset." With that kind of loyalty, Google Assistant doesn't stand much of a chance of gaining any traction on iOS any time soon.   Yet some would argue that it's always best to give users more choice and there's definitely some merit to that thinking. Well, at least for the 8% of users who aren't committed to the Apple ecosystem that Morgan Stanley pointed out.   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Software by Erin Carson May 18, 2017 12:02 PM PDT @erincarson New Google tools will power Star Wars VR high-end mobile experiences At Google I/O, the company announced a partnership with ILM to use Google's Seurat software tools to build more cinematic, mobile Star Wars VR experiences. 3:00 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF The next Star Wars film might be just that much better thanks to a new technology from Google. The search giant unveiled a new tool called Seurat at its Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, California, on Thursday. It partnered with ILMxLab, the branch of Star Wars maker Lucasfilm that's focused on new technologies, to come up with a better way visualize scenes in virtual reality. Seurat, which yes is named after the famous painter, can take a high-fidelity scene like something you might find in a high-end video game, and run it on a low-power mobile VR headset. The result: cinematic realism in VR. It's unclear from Google's presentation what this technology will ultimately be used for, whether its aimed at filmmakers or developers making VR experiences for fans -- or both. 20 Google I/O, a playground for developers (pictures) "When I see people in our demo looking at the floor on their hands and knees, down to inspect the curvature of every bend and twist, I really think we're onto something," said Lewey Geselowitz, a senior UX engineer at ILMxLabs, in a video. Google and ILMxLab said this is the first time they've been able to take high quality, cinematic images and turn them into something that can be looked at in real time. To them, this is a breakthrough.

At a developer session at Google's I/O developer conference called "What's New With Daydream," some of the stats were revealed. The main takeaways: Google VR users spend more, are looking for more experiences, and don't spend as much time in their headsets as you probably think. According to Google's Brahim Elbouchikhi and Darren Delaye, the average Daydream user spends 40 minutes a week in VR. That doesn't seem like a lot: that's 5.7 minutes a day. Of that, nearly half is spent in video, like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu or other apps. Which means, if you're making a non-video app or game, you're trying to grab 20 minutes out of a Daydream VR user's week. There's good news, though: apparently, Daydream VR users are three times more likely to buy something, and spend up to 32 percent more than other Android users. That could also be related to Daydream View owners being more premium phone buyers with more disposable income, of course. Google's advice, at the session I attended at least, was to make more apps that are longer and meatier, and more interesting. Google acknowledges that it needs an Angry Birds of VR, or really any killer app. Upcoming standalone VR headsets are designed to be more "friction free," meaning possibly more time spent in the headsets... and more time in VR. And, Google's Daydream 2.0 software update will focus on spending more time in the headset being social and checking messages, with less need to take the headset off periodically. Whether that turns into more VR hours a week remains to be seen: even getting to a full hour would be an achievement.

Internet by Richard Nieva May 18, 2017 11:34 AM PDT @richardjnieva YouTube announced a way to watch VR videos with friends. James Martin/CNET YouTube is trying to make its virtual reality app more social. Google's video site announced Thursday at its I/O developer conference that people will be able to watch VR videos together while in its VR app. While you're in there, you and a small group of friends can sync up videos to watch together simultaneously and talk to each other about what's going on. At the bottom of the screen, you'll see which of your friends is in the "room," along with a cartoonish avatar for each of them. One of the first demos YouTube showed off was a video from the band Gorillaz. Silicon Valley giants have been enamored with virtual reality, but they're trying to flip the script on the stereotype that VR is isolating. Last month, Facebook announced a social platform for its Oculus headset, called Facebook Spaces. In that app, you'll be able to gather with other friends' avatars in a VR world to do things like watch videos or draw. YouTube's new feature will be available "later this year."

To sweeten its offer, Google extended its Actions on Google platform – by which developers can define how Google Assistant responds to input – to iOS phones and taught Assistant to ingest text input from mobile phones, for times when speaking aloud might be awkward. It also announced support for transactions, presently available for Home apps and coming soon to mobile apps, for buying things by voice and text. The Chocolate Factory has even promised to integrate image recognition capabilities in the coming months, through a service called Google Lens, to allow Assistant to understand spoken or text queries made in reference to objects depicted in images. Brad Abrams, group product manager for Google Assistant, said the goal with Assistant is to facilitate "a conversation between you and Google that helps you get things done." Google's goal with developers is similar – to help them build software that encourages conversations with its Assistant software. Thanks to tools like the Actions Console, a web-based dashboard for configuring projects that use Assistant and for making them accessible to apps and devices, the necessary programming isn't that difficult. The flow, as explained by Adam Coimbra, partner technology manager at Google, goes something like this: Create a project using the Actions Console. Use API.AI, or another natural language processing service, link input to an action. Configure a webhook, using Node.js or another language, to trigger the action. Test in Google web simulator or on a device. Ensure the app works appropriately for mobile devices. Integrate the app with the Transaction API, if necessary. The process is similar to a configuring service like IFTTT, where an input event triggers a response event or series of them. The difference is that those developing for Assistant have to anticipate a wide range of possible input because there are no fixed format for commands spoken or typed in natural language. That's where API.AI comes in. The developer maps intents – what the user says or types – to a specific action. Thus, an app creator might map "Book a ticket to Los Angeles" to a specific book_ticket action defined in code, making sure to ask for necessary parameters, like time, date, and location if they're not supplied. The challenge involves planning for other possible variations of that intent, such as "Buy me a ticket to Los Angeles." A modest amount of human intelligence is necessary to instruct API.AI's algorithms to do their thing. Assistant ecosystem One reason developers may want to bother dipping their toes in the water is that Google intends to make Assistant an ecosystem, one that (hopefully) benefits developers and users, just as Search does for publishers and readers, and Google Play does for Android developers and customers. Assistant developers can look forward not only to a directory that promotes apps, but Vera Tzoneva, who works on global product partnerships for the Google Assistant, explained that Google will promote Assistant apps through explicit invocation – when a Google Home user, for example, says the name of the app – and implicit invocation – when someone asks Assistant to take an action associated with one or more apps. So saying, "Hey Google, I want to work out" might bring up a developer's exercise-related app, even if it was not explicitly named. Implicit invocation thus functions like search, and may eventually provide similar marketing benefits to developers. Unfortunately for developers, Google appears to have no desire to explain its specific criteria for invoking Assistant apps. In terms of ranking, Tzoneva said a lot of different factors get considered. "One of the primary things is the quality of the app and user context," she added. So, make a brilliant Assistant app and Google may love you. Maybe. ® Tips and corrections 3 Comments MORE Google Home Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register US judges say you can Google Google, but you can't google Google The Chocolate Factory is spared the aspirin treatment by the 9th District Court 58 Comments Google's PHP API client has XSS vulnerability Patch promised Google opens patent pool for Android Protects against trolls maybe.

You can pick the most innocent of topics, like say kittens napping in a wicker basket on a sunny day, and it won’t take you long to find a prodigiously persistent troll spamming the chat with Nazi insignia, racist abuse, or anything else designed to shock and offend the greatest number of people. So yes, YouTube chats need a remedy, but Google’s Super Chat idea is the worst possible solution to the problem. What is a Super Chat? It’s a method to amplify the visibility of your chat message on a live stream by making it larger, giving it some color, and pinning it atop the chat window for a period of time. Oh, and it costs you money. That’s right, in Google’s vision of the future, you get the special privilege of paying to be noticed. Got something clever to say? Better shake out a few shekels from your coin purse to make sure your fellow viewers note and appreciate your incisive wit. Want your favorite YouTuber to know you’re supporting them in their artistic endeavors? Pay up and they will feel the warm glow of your appreciation. During its big Google I/O keynote this week, Google highlighted Super Chats in a lengthy segment built around the Slo Mo Guys, a YouTube duo with a penchant for recording things in super slow-motion. The Google presenter paid $500 for a Super Chat, which not only made her message big and bold, but it also triggered a horn that signaled to a group surrounding the Slo Mo Guys to pelt them with a bunch of water balloons. Now, I’m only academically familiar with live porn cams, but isn’t this practically their entire business model? When you pay to have another person perform your twisted little fantasies, the end result is usually a loss of dignity on all sides. Google’s I/O update for paid chats is the introduction of the Super Chat API, which lets creators script events in the real world that are triggered by the purchase of a Super Chat. It could be the sdtudio lights turning on or off, a drone being launched, or, as in the example above, a loud horn blasting an alert. The vectors for abuse and deleterious effects with something like Super Chats are simply too numerous. It allows trolls to automate the process of harassing a streamer by just buying a Super Chat and leaving an abusive message pinned. (Google has some spam blocking mechanisms, but no amount of word filtering will completely circumvent things like, say, an ASCII representation of a middle finger). And even when the intent might not be malevolent, the whole "pay the monkey on screen to dance" thing is just distasteful and exploitative. There’s a fine line between supporting a creator and subjugating them As with most live streaming things, Twitch is ahead of YouTube on this. You can already pay money to Twitch for animated "cheers," which direct some of the revenue toward the streamers you follow. Or, if you want more prominence for your comment à la Super Chat, you can also donate money and have your comment displayed on an overlay of the stream. The underlying premise, both for Twitch and YouTube, is that you’re supporting the creators of your favorite online content. YouTube, however, is fundamentally different from Twitch. It is vastly larger and more influential, and its users are not a monoculture of gamers and gaming fans. People do a much wider range of things on camera for YouTube, which makes them more vulnerable to being abused or taken advantage of. The practical implications of putting the Super Chat monetary mechanics in place are that the relatively better off will be able to dictate what the relatively worse off will do for them. As with most popularity contests, what’s likely to happen with paid chats of this kind is a race to the bottom among creators looking to do more extreme and shocking things to earn a higher Super Chat income. "Super Chat me $100, and I’ll eat rotten food. $200 and I’ll do dessert as well." "Hey, I’ll drink stale milk for $20." "What about me? I’ll eat an entire onion for five bucks." Manipulating YouTube streams for money isn’t the bleakest timeline, but it’s pretty close And what does the existence of Super Chat say to people without the disposable income to spend on manipulating YouTube streams? That their voices don’t matter? Only the wealthy will be able to speak with the added volume of color and a pin. That’s a dangerous cultural message to be promoting among impressionable young people, who make up a large chunk of YouTube’s audience, even if the intended users of this particular feature are an older crowd. YouTube is a pretty cool place, but the way many of us act on it is far from cool. To improve human communication on a social platform like YouTube, Google needs to craft intelligent social engineering structures that foster a spirit of community and solidarity — and last year’s YouTube Community is a venture in precisely that direction. YouTube creators also deserve to be paid for their effort, absolutely. But this Super Chat abomination? It’s as ill-conceived as 2016’s abortive Google Spaces, but I see it as more pernicious because there’s a danger of people actually using Super Chats.

HOME LOCAL POLITICS INTERVIEWS WORLD SPORTS COLUMNS EDITORIAL MY TAPROBANA RED CARPET CEYLON POLITICS TALKING CRICKET MINORITY PERSPECTIVES MY SERENDIB SCI / TECH ENTERTAINMENT GALLERY BIZARRE Features Mosaic Lite Hello Look PRINT EDITION News Columns Sport Focus Interviews FT Opinion E-PAPER CONTACT Google’s future is useful, creepy and everywhere   👤  2723 readers have read this article ! By 2017-05-19 There were whoops and cheers from developers as Google announced the incremental ways it is strengthening its grip on many aspects of people's lives at its annual developer conference, Google I/O. There were no jaw-dropping major product launches nor executives proclaiming their utopian vision of the future (ahem, Mark Zuckerberg). Instead there was a showcase of features, powered by artificial intelligence, designed to make people more connected – and more reliant on Google. "We are focused on our core mission of organizing the world's information for everyone and approach this by applying deep computer science and technical insights to solve problems at scale," said CEO Sundar Pichai. By combining the personal data harvested from its users with industry leading (and human Go player beating) artificial intelligence, Google is squeezing itself into spaces in our everyday interactions it hasn't been before, filling in the gaps and oozing into new territory like a sticky glue that is becoming harder and harder to escape. Here's what the key I/O announcements tell us about Google's future. 1. AI is Google's USP Google reiterated that the company has shifted from a mobile-first to an AI-first approach. This means using AI at the core of all of its new products, whether that's to improve image recognition in Google Assistant or for beating human players at Go. 2. Google wants to 'see' as well as 'hear' your surroundings Lens is Google's answer to Facebook's augmented reality Camera Effects platform. It comprises a set of vision-based computing capabilities, combined into Google Assistant and the Photos app, that works to 'understand' what you're looking at. So you can point the camera at a flower and it will identify the species or automatically connect to a wifi network by showing the camera the log-in details printed on the sticker on the router. You can also hold your camera up to a restaurant in the street and see reviews. 3. Google Assistant is getting smarter Google's equivalent of Siri, Google Assistant, is embedded in Android devices including smartphones, watches and Google Home. Google's Scott Huffman noted that Assistant would become even more conversational over the coming months, allowing you accomplish tasks with a quick chat. In addition to having voice recognition, Google Assistant, drawing on Lens, can now take in, understand and have conversations about what you see. For example, if you are in Japan but don't read Japanese you can hold the Assistant up to a sign advertising some street food and it will 'read' and translate the text. You can then ask "what does it look like?" and Google will know that the "it" refers to the name of the food written on the sign and it will pull up pictures of the dish. "It comes so naturally to humans and now Google is getting really good at conversations too," said Huffman. 4. Google Home is getting creepier (and more useful) Voice-activated smart speaker Google Home, will now start offering 'proactive assistance' rather than waiting for you to say 'OK, Google' to wake it up. For example, it might notify you if you have to leave your house earlier than expected because traffic is particularly heavy. Perhaps the company will start proactively advertising to customers in the future? Less creepy is the option to make hands-free calls from the Google Home speaker. You simply ask it to dial any landline or mobile number in the US or Canada and it will do so for free. The device can also now recognize up to six different voices in a household and adapt to personal preferences accordingly. 5. Google wants to replace Siri on iPhones A key theme throughout the keynote was creating a seamless experience across devices, even if that device isn't in Google's Android ecosystem. This means that Google Assistant is now available on the iPhone. Assistant is widely considered much smarter than Siri, thanks to the fact that Google harvests a lot more personal data than privacy-conscious Apple. This means that frustrated Siri users wanting to translate a sentence into another language, play a movie on their Chromecast-enabled TV or order takeout using voice commands will now be able to do so. 6. It's trying to keep YouTube creators happy Ever since Google added stricter controls for advertisers on YouTube after it was discovered ads were being placed alongside hate speech or terrorist videos, some vloggers have complained about making less money. YouTube relies on these internet celebrities to post regular videos and live streams as they attract huge audiences to the platform. That might explain why the company has launched the 'super chat', first announced in January. Audience members can pay to have their comment featured prominently during a live stream and in turn donate money to the YouTuber or their chosen cause. The feature was enabled during a popular live stream of a New York-based giraffe giving birth in February, allowing the zoo to make 'tens of thousands' of dollars. 7. It wants to take a slice of recruitment advertising Google for Jobs is a new search function that, by disintermediating the many job listings middlemen, makes it easier for people to find employment (and harder for those listing sites to make money). "We want to better connect employers and job seekers through Google for Jobs," said Pichai. The company has worked with partners including LinkedIn, Monster, and Career Builder to aggregate search in one place – similar to what it's done with its airline-search tool, Google Flights. The company uses machine learning to understand and group together roles where employers and employees use different words, for example store clerk and retail manager. Pichai positioned the launch as an effort to boost American employment, but it's sure to help get Google – already taking, along with Facebook, the lion's share of online advertising revenue – a bigger slice of the pie. 8. It needs to attract the "next billion" or two During the I/O keynote, Pichai stated that seven of Google's products have more than a billion monthly users: Google search, Android, Chrome, Maps, YouTube, Google Play and Gmail. However, if it's to continue to grow it needs to attract the so-called 'next billion' users, typically users in lower income countries just starting to come online through mobile devices. That's why Google has developed Android Go, a pared-down version of the mobile operating system for entry-level devices that uses less data and loads apps more quickly, even when the signal is poor. Android Go will be embedded in the latest version of Google's mobile operating system, Android O, which is more battery efficient and features better protections against viruses and malware in downloaded apps – a notorious problem for Android devices compared with iPhones. 9. It's realistic about VR and AR There's a bucketload of hype around VR and AR, but Google's approach felt more measured, focusing on the immediate, practical applications. (Perhaps a symptom of being burned by the now defunct Google Glass prototype, launched with great fanfare and an army of tech evangelists). The company already has an entry level VR headset that uses a smartphone as the screen, but it teased a couple of more advanced standalone DayDream headsets, made in collaboration with HTC and Lenovo. The details were scarce but Google emphasized that unlike with Oculus or HTC Vive headsets, DayDream headset users wouldn't need expensive computers to power them or rigs of external cameras to detect the person's position. With augmented reality, Google described a 'visual positioning system' similar to GPS but with centimetre accuracy. It works by using the camera to identify objects visually within a space, for example a large store. This means you'd be able to hold up your camera (or wear a pair of smart glasses) and be guided to a specific product on a shelf. This extends Google's mission to organize the world's information into the physical domain. "Imagine what it could mean to people with impaired vision," said Clay Bavor, Vice President of virtual reality, who suggested that Google-powered camera phones (or other wearable devices) could act as a blind person's 'eyes'.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai speaks at Google I/O 2017. (Screenshot) Google is “rethinking our computational architecture again,” according to CEO Sundar Pichai, who rolled out the next generation of Google’s specialized chips for machine-learning research Wednesday. The new chips are called Cloud TPUs (tensor processing units), and they are available for Google Cloud Platform customers right away, Pichai said on stage at the Shoreline Amphitheater to kick off Google I/O. Google has built arrays of these TPUs called “TPU pods,” which contain 64 TPUs and are capable of delivering 11.5 petaflops of processing power. A Google Cloud TPU pod. (Courtesy: Google) “One of our new large-scale translation models used to take a full day to train on 32 of the best commercially-available GPUs—now it trains to the same accuracy in an afternoon using just one eighth of a TPU pod,” wrote two Google legends — AI research fellow Jeff Dean and infrastructure czar Urs Hölzle — in a blog post announcing the new chips. The “commercially-available GPUs” phrase is a mild shot at Nvidia, which has grabbed the early lead in the small but important market for advanced machine learning research. But Google has been designing its own chips for artificial intelligence and machine learning applications for several years, and while it still plans to offer Google Cloud Platform customers the option of running workloads on Nvidia’s chips (according to The Next Platform), it’s pretty clear which chip design it prefers. A Google Cloud TPU board. (Courtesy: Google) Google’s “commercially available” claim also carefully sidesteps Nvidia’s new Volta architecture, which was announced last week and will be available later this year. Nvidia’s chips have been used by all the major cloud providers — including Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure — to allow customers to conduct machine-learning research without having to set up their own servers. Is Google's TPU investment the biggest advantage ever or laying groundwork for being disrupted? Can Google out-innovate sum of industry? — Steven Sinofsky 🍪ॐ (@stevesi) May 17, 2017 Google’s focus on its TPUs is “an important advance in our technical infrastructure for the cloud era,” Pichai said while revealing the new chips. And it’s a cultural shift as well: Google has always been at the cutting edge of technical infrastructure design, but it’s tended to keep those advances under wraps for its own use. Google Cloud Platform customers will be able to kick the tires on these chips through an alpha program launched Wednesday.

Google just confirmed that it’s bringing its Google Assistant to the iPhone, expanding its voice technology beyond Google Home and Android devices, potentially making it a more formidable competitor to Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa and Microsoft’s Cortana. Starting today, we're bringing the #GoogleAssistant to iPhones. Whether at home or on the go, your Assistant is here to help. #io17 pic.twitter.com/a6T20HwnU9 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 The announcement was made at the Google I/O developer conference in Mountain View, Calif. In addition, Google announced that it’s bringing voice calling to its Google Home smart speaker. Amazon last week announced a similar feature for its Echo speakers. Another new Google Home feature is proactive alerts, a version of which Amazon announced this week. Google also announced a software development kit that will allow third-party device makers to incorporate Google Assistant into non-Google hardware, following in the footsteps of Amazon’s expansion of Alexa beyond its own Echo devices. Microsoft offers Cortana on the iPhone and last week announced plans to deepen the connection between Windows 10 and the Cortana apps for Android and iPhone in an upcoming feature called Timeline, tracking a user’s activity across the devices. Among other news, Google announced plans for standalone VR headsets.

First you have to open the app, login, type out the email address of the recipient, and then send them the money. Wouldn’t it be nice if you can just send money to someone simply by talking to your phone? As part of a number of a number of new features headed to Google Assistant, you’ll soon be able to send someone money using nothing but your voice. Once the feature goes live, you’ll only have to say something like, “OK Google, send $10 Billy for pizza,” and watch as Assistant verifies your identity with a fingerprint, then sends the money. Assistant will use whichever debit card you have linked to your Google account, so there’s no fiddling around inside any app or any of that nonsense. Google announced the feature during Google IO 2017 and is part of their plan to add more payment features inside of Android. Google says the feature will be available in the coming months providing you live in the US.

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: NXP Semiconductors NV Pledges Full Support For Google's "Android Things" Platform This partnership should result in faster development of safer Internet of Things tools, often connected to Google's popular Chromecast and Google Assistant devices. Anders Bylund (TMFZahrim) May 18, 2017 at 6:55PM So NXP Semiconductors (NASDAQ:NXPI) is waiting for the final regulatory approvals to trigger an avalanche of shares being committed to Qualcomm 's (NASDAQ:QCOM) long-running tender offer. The pending buyout may have frozen NXP's stock prices just below Qualcomm's firm all-cash offer of $110 per share, but NXP isn't sitting on its hands while the merger drama plays out. For example, NXP just pledged support for Alphabet 's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android Things platform. The embedded semiconductor specialist will ensure that its Internet of Things products come with full support for Android Things. NXP's official support for this embedded software solution includes everything from the i.MX applications processor to the company's low-power Wi-Fi controllers and security chips. In return, Android Things gives NXP a quick and easy development path for clients who want to build next-generation IoT devices. Furthermore, the data safety relationship does not end when you buy one of these connected technology appliances. Google supplies a constant stream of security updates for Android Things devices. Brillo Argon is one of NXP's pre-approved development bases for Android Things. Note the plethora of open connectors. Image source: NXP. Through this platform and NXP's hardware, consumers will be able to access Google Assistant and Chromecast user interfaces for gadgets such as smart home tools, networked home entertainment systems, wearable computing gear, and more. The devices will also enjoy all of Google's work on Android security. A broad consumer-facing platform will always have more resources pouring into their security challenges than any independent, minor-league solution could hope for. That's a big deal. NXP's official involvement in the Android Things system should speed up development processes for home electronics specialists with a yen for the Internet of Things. As usual, the company is supplying a range of pre-built hardware frameworks to which each developer can connect their own sensors and additional processing tools. The final products should be shelf-ready very quickly, and built around a recognized set of hardware and software standards. The combination of Android's consumer reach and NXP's IoT know-how should result in many new consumer devices -- perhaps even new types of Internet of Things gadgets. Most of this will fly under the radar from the consumer's point of view, of course. But NXP investors should notice an uptick in IoT product sales as this partnership matures. I mean, Qualcomm investors will be the ones who benefit from NXP's moves today. But you see my point. NXP keeps chipping away at the IoT market in fair weather or foul, making sure that Qualcomm is acquiring a valuable and sprightly business.

For you, this means totally new ways to game, be entertained and interact with cutting-edge apps from the comfort of your couch. The best part? It’s coming to Verizon this summer. Augment your reality Virtual reality has become hugely popular in recent years thanks to increased adoption of mobile VR headsets, like Google Daydream, and rapid innovation in VR applications. Augmented reality takes the concept of VR and spins it around. Rather than put on a headset and be virtually transported to another world, you can use your ZenFone AR to bring the virtual world into your surroundings and interact with virtual pets, games, clothing and furniture as if they were in your actual living room. With the ZenFone AR, you can use augmented reality to view clothing on a virtual model before you commit, see how furniture looks and fits in your man cave (or lady den) and experience the most immersive gaming available on a smartphone. To date, there are more than 100 Tango (Google’s core VR and AR technology) compatible apps on Google Play, and ASUS and Google are partnering with well-known brands to bring even more AR fun to your ZenFone AR. Beyond VR The ZenFone AR offers a virtual and augmented experience that is second to none. It is fully compatible with the Google Daydream View, allowing users to enjoy VR games and movies in full cinematic glory thanks to the smartphone’s 5.7” high-resolution display. The long-lasting 3,300 mAh battery ensures your VR and AR enjoyment won’t be interrupted, and the DTS HeadphoneX audio allows you to escape from reality with full cinematic sound. The ASUS ZenFone AR is coming to Verizon this summer so you won’t have to wait long to try it out yourself. Keep an eye on the Verizon media center for additional information, including pricing, availability and updates on the latest AR apps, and visit ASUS for more ZenFone AR features and specs.     Print       Email Published: 1 min ago on May 19, 2017 By: Foreign Affairs Publisher Last Modified: May 19, 2017 @ 10:14 am Filed Under: Business, Computer Technologies, Economics, English, Global Economy, MIL OSI, MIL OSI Economics, Open Source Intel, Verizon NEXT ARTICLE → Crash at Gepps Cross – two men taken to hospital ← PREVIOUS ARTICLE AT&T Continues support of Black Businesses as Sponsor of the 2017 Black Enterprise Entrepreneurs Summit About the author Foreign Affairs Publisher View all articles by Foreign Affairs Publisher » Recent Posts AT&T Continues support of Black Businesses as Sponsor of the 2017 Black Enterprise Entrepreneurs Summit Bring your imagination to life with the new ASUS ZenFone AR augmented reality smartphone Crash at Gepps Cross – two men taken to hospital Stolen car involved in Lightsview crash Suspicious car fires © 2017 ForeignAffairs.co.nz.

When you get it, there will be a few more goodies that Google's didn't see fit to talk about. It turns out there is a full editable history of what you say to Assistant. Prior to this change, Assistant would only show you queries from your current session. Close Assistant, and it was all gone the next time you called up Assistant. With the typing input, you can also scroll way back and see your old questions and answers. We don't know how far back it goes yet—the feature only just rolled out. Left: editing a query, Right: the old Assistant look for reference Additionally, you can long-press on any exchange and either edit or delete it. If you delete it, Assistant warns you the data is useful for crafting better answers in the future, so you shouldn't make a habit of it. Editing lets you tweak the query by typing, and then you can send it to get a different answer. Thanks: Łukasz Ordon Tags assistant Google io17 io2017 subscribe ...

[Update: There will be an unlocked model too] The ZenFone AR will be a Verizon exclusive in the United States Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 12:28pm PDTMay 18, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 17 Share on Facebook 45 Share on Twitter Total Shares71 ASUS News Verizon Wireless Update 1: 2017/05/18 4:07pm PDT It seems Verizon's press release was misleading. ASUS has confirmed to us that an unlocked model will be available in the United States as well, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. Mobile VR hasn't really taken off, and Google's augmented-reality Project Tango experiment is in the same boat. The first publicly-available phone with Project Tango, the Lenovo Phab2 Pro, launched last year. If you read our review, you'll know that the massive size, poor performance, and price made it hard sell even for VR/AR enthusiasts. Unfortunately, the upcoming Tango-powered ZenFone AR already has a major flaw; it will be Verizon-exclusive in the United States. This seems like a dumb move, as the market for this phone was already incredibly tiny, and now even less people will be inclined to buy it. If you need a refresher, the ZenFone AR was announced back in January with a Snapdragon 821 CPU, up to 8GB of RAM, a 5.7" 1440p display, and Android 7.0. Verizon neglected to announce pricing, but it will be available from Big Red this summer. Update 1: 2017/05/18 4:07pm PDT It seems Verizon's press release was misleading. ASUS has confirmed to us that an unlocked model will be available in the United States as well, compatible with AT&T and T-Mobile. End of Update Press Release MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today at Google I/O, ASUS announced that Verizon will be the exclusive wireless provider of the ZenFone AR in the United States. The next-generation smartphone represents a significant advancement in mobile virtual and augmented reality technologies. The ZenFone AR is the world's first smartphone that supports both Tango AR and Daydream VR technologies developed by Google, giving users totally new ways to engage with and be entertained by their smartphones. During Google I/O, Johnny Lee, head of the Google Tango team, demonstrated Tango and Daydream on the ZenFone AR. The ZenFone AR will come with the Android 7.0 Nougat OS with 6 GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, and will be available this summer at Verizon. Tango is an augmented reality (AR) platform that uses qualified devices to detect their users' positions relative to places and objects around them without using GPS or other external signals. This allows application developers to create AR experiences that include indoor navigation, 3D mapping, and environmental recognition, among other augmented reality applications. Daydream is a high-quality virtual reality (VR) platform that is built into the Android operating system to support VR apps. The ASUS ZenFone AR was developed in close cooperation with Google to deliver the best user experience on both Tango and Daydream platforms. Ideal for AR and VR Tango adds three abilities to the ZenFone AR: motion tracking, depth perception and area learning. Through these capabilities, the ZenFone AR can detect how far it is away from a floor, wall or an object and understand where it is moving in three-dimensional space. AR is a rapidly growing segment for mobile technology and one consumers are extremely excited about. To date, there are over 100 Tango compatible apps on Google Play1. ASUS and Google are also partnering with well-known brands to bring the Tango AR experience to customers. For VR, the large, high-resolution and high-contrast display of the ZenFone AR makes it ideal for VR applications when used as a VR display mounted in the Daydream View headset. The ZenFone AR’s expansive 5.7-inch screen immerses the viewer in whatever VR world is being presented, while the WQHD (1440 x 2560) resolution presents images with extreme clarity and deep black hues enabled by the high-contrast super AMOLED technology which enhances the 3D effect of the screen. Powerful Supporting Hardware To make the ZenFone AR an ideal VR and AR smartphone, it has been designed with the latest top-of-the-line components that also make it one of the most powerful smartphones in the market: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8212 Processor: The Snapdragon 821 processor used by the ZenFone AR has been specially optimized for AR operations. ASUS worked closely with Qualcomm Technologies engineers and Google to efficiently distribute computer vision workloads. Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 GPU: With 6GB of RAM and the desktop-class Qualcomm® Adreno™ 530 graphics processing unit (GPU) that delivers supercharged graphics performance, the ZenFone AR handles the visual graphic demands of Tango and Daydream with ease. Superior Hi-Res Audio and DTS Virtual Surround Sound: Complementing the rich AR & VR experiences offered by the ZenFone AR is a new audio system that supports Hi-Res Audio and DTS virtual surround sound. External audio also gets a boost with the ZenFone AR’s new ultra-loud 5-magnet speaker. Photographic Maestro: The ZenFone AR is also an accomplished camera smartphone. It has the same ASUS PixelMaster 3.0 camera system found in the ZenFone AR that comprises of the world's highest resolution Sony IMX318 sensor and TriTech Autofocus system. AVAILABILITY & PRICING The ZenFone AR will be available with 6GB of RAM and 128 GB of storage, with Verizon as the exclusive wireless provider, in the United States in summer 2017. Pricing will be announced at a later date. 1 Tango apps on Google play: http://get.google.com/tango/apps/ 2 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 for Tango information: https://www.qualcomm.com/products/snapdragon/devices/tango ### About ASUS ASUS is one of Fortune magazine’s World’s Most Admired Companies, and is dedicated to creating products for today and tomorrow’s smart life.

Dumb dumb dumb... Corbin Davenport Well, the Pixel/Pixel XL was still available unlocked and on Project Fi. This probably won't be. SyCoREAPER Not on Verizon anymore but at least it isn't another goddamn Motorola device which was pretty much all they offered last I had them raffr Considering google's inability to keep the phone in stock, i think it matters little that verizon is the only carrier selling the Pixel. lomsha Lack of stock doesn't automatically equal crazy demand if they only produce puny amounts. ProductFRED Yeah, and that's a device people actually wanted to begin with... raffr ' This seems like an incredibly dumb move by ASUS.." you are assuming other carriers even wanted to sell this phone! _jsw_ I think the idea is that an unlocked version would likely be at least as likely to sell because, let's face it, this is a developer/early adopter phone, so the more places it can be bought, the more phones they'll sell. Toan Ngo Way to kill adoption! SyCoREAPER Everyone here is assuming this is a great phone, it sounds great. For all you know it's going to be a flop, a Verizon exclusive flop mxwp if the review for the prior phone is any indication SyCoREAPER Same could have been argued for Samsung, but it literally blew up in their face. ha I've got jokes. The point stands though, you never know. Liam Bulkley Specs are wrong. According to your link (and the asus site), the zenfone ar will have a Snapdragon 821 w/8gb ram. No mention of battery, though 5Ah sounds right to me considering how tango needs all the emfs. I hope the next Pixel has tango compatible hardware. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Marty Don't really get the Project Tango significance, but the phone seems to have good specs. Too big for my tastes, though. DrunkSpock Tango is pretty magical actually, I've been doing some development with their devkit a while now. It can place spatially oriented 3D objects into your camera stream with micro-millimeter precision. Fun stuff. Frank King With all those OEMs fighting to come up with special features, I'm kinda surprised there is still so few Tango devices.. R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Damn I was interested in this phone. I like AR/VR even if it's a fad right now. Was trying to decide between pixel2, zenfone AR, and the OnePlus 5. As a T-Mobile customer guess my decision got easier. Kenny’s Turtle "This seems like an incredibly dumb move by ASUS, as the market for this phone was already incredibly tiny, and now even less people will be inclined to buy it." Not sure how being sold in the number one mobile network's stores is a dumb move, considering all of their previous phones couldn't even be used on the Verizon network. The Phab 2 Pro has been available to all GSM mobile users since its launch. How are those sales numbers? Maybe a different approach isn't so dumb after all. _jsw_ The P2P is a piece of crap. It wouldn't have sold any more had it been a Verizon exclusive. _jsw_ Is this "exclusively Verizon" in the sense that it will not be available to buy *anywhere* else, or "exclusively Verizon" like the Pixel? "Verizon as the exclusive wireless provider" is ambiguous. Artem Russakovskii Yup, that. Fucking Verizon. _jsw_ Fucking Verizon indeed. I've been waiting for a decent Tango device for so long that I might do shameful things to get this, though. Maybe. Hopefully there will be rumors of a Pixel Tango by the time this comes out. Artem Russakovskii Wait, did you see the update to the post? _jsw_ Um... no. :o Came here directly from the email notification. But, on the other hand, thinking it was confirmed I'd have to get it from Verizon and then finding out that an unlocked model will be available makes it even better! Sometimes being inept pays off! Nathan J Nice to see Asus phones working in the US, but mid-rangers with hardware keys? In 2017? Come on now. Bring premium phones to the US.

Android Studio 3.0 brings Kotlin support and a ton of new debugging tools Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 1:45pm PDTMay 18, 2017 7 Plus 1 on G+ 32 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares94 Android O Android OS Android Things Android Wear Development Google News Videos Article Contents 1 Languages 2 New targets and platforms 3 Design and build 4 Debugging 5 Etc. Android Studio 3.0 seems to be living up to that major version change the 3.0 number implies. There are many useful new tools for developers, especially when it comes to improving and easing the burden of debugging. There are also some changes that will require advanced preparation to keep your apps and workflow functioning before things break. We have many things to cover, so let's dive in. Languages To start, 3.0 brings with it support for Kotlin, which we also covered here, so you don't need to install anything extra to be able to play around with the new language support. All the interested need to do is jump forward into 3.0 via the Canary channel and enable it, either in their next app via the new project wizard, or via the language selector when adding new activities to an existing project. There is also a conversion tool for bringing your Java classes over to Kotlin. It's not going to be magic, but it should help with porting stuff over. In other language-related news for the platform, we also get the new desugar bytecode transformations from javac in the default toolchain. This can replace the now deprecated Jack and Retrolambda for bringing some convenient Java 8 features into Android Studio like lambdas, method references, default and static interface methods, and try-with-resources. New targets and platforms The new Android Instant Apps SDK, recently opened for all to use, also requires Android Studio 3.0. So even if you aren't interested in Kotlin, you'll have to jump into canary channel if you are looking forward to playing with that. IntelliJ IDEA is still the base for Android Studio, and the change to 3.0 updates things to the 2017.1 branch. That means you get all the same new features from that version like semantic highlighting, Java 8 refactoring, enhanced version control search, and smart conflict resolution. New layout and graphical resource tools are also present in the form of adaptive icon support and expanded font support to include making and previewing XML and binary fonts, as well as the ability to download from Google Fonts in the Layout Editor. Android Things support is now also present in the IDE via a convenient new set of templates in associated wizards, so the barrier to entry for development on that platform is going to be much lower.   Design and build The new Android Studio brings with it a new Gradle plugin that is all about speeding up your build process and increasing the granularity of dependencies. This has also resulted in changes in the DSL for Gradle that broke the old API in Android Studio. If you depended on them, you might have to check and see what effect that has on you and, if necessary, migrate things over at some point. Google is also now self-distributing its build artifacts in its aptly named Google's Maven Repo, so setting up continuous integration servers for your projects will be a bit easier. Both the Layout Editor and Layout Inspector are seeing changes in 3.0, to better help with improving your app UI and overall user experience. There are new constraints like chains, barriers, and groups for easing chain creation and making sure things look the way you want on more devices and in more situations. There is also a new error panel for layout issues to let you know if you might be missing any constraints that could otherwise mess with your UI. Debugging Debugging seems to have been given a big focus with the updated tools in Android Studio 3.0. For one, the new Android Profiler. As we mentioned in the previous post, it gives developers a means of visually identifying CPU, Memory, and Network usage spikes that might correspond to app events, which are also labeled on the graph. For non-O based emulator images or devices, you have to enable advanced profiling in the run configuration window to see all the new features. The resolution also increases at a fine level for finding the precise cause of jank on all of the three graphs. For CPU usage that means you can view things down to checking thread usage and method traces. With the RAM use graph, you get more precise memory allocation, the ability to track object allocations, and you can dive into heap dumps. Network info gives you requests and responses for headers and payloads done in HTTP or via supported clients like Volley and OkHttp. The Android Studio native debugger also now works for APKs made in game toolkits like like Unity, APKs with C/C++ code, and APKs from other IDEs. The APK analyzer in Android Studio has been updated to work with Instant App zips. The text viewer also has an updated UI with more filter and search options, and can also now open shrunk and obfuscated code via ProGuard mapping files as well as create ProGuard keep rules. Etc.   There are also smaller features in the update that will improve the overall quality of life for developers. The Device File Explorer is, as you'd guess, a new way to explore file systems on emulators or connected devices in the IDE, so you don't have to use ADB for that. The emulator will also have full OpenGL ES 3.0 support, WiFi network emulation, a bug reporter, and images will include the full Play Store. The latter will cut down prep time before testing and will make updating play services or other apps required easier. The new images are signed, though, so you won't be able to get root in them. Android Wear developers will also be able to use rotary input controls in their apps, at least on devices that have crowns that feature rotational input. There are a lot of SDK updates you'll need to use the new tools, and I'll toss those in a note below so you can double check that you are up to date if you run into any issues. Canary and Dev Channel Updates SDK Platform O r2* Build-tools 26.0.0-rc2 Platform-Tools 26.0.0-rc2 Emulator 26.1.0 Lldb-3.0.3970975 Android O Google API's x86 System Images r3 Android TV x86 O System Image r2 Android O Play x86 Play System Images r3 O Wear System Image r2 NDK r15 beta 2 Android Instant Apps 1.0 Google Repository Updates Stable Channel Updates Platform-tools 25.0.6 The new O Developer Preview image is also available for download. You can, therefore, use these new features in Android Studio 3.0 on the newest version of Android in the emulator. Between the Canary channel and Developer Beta, I would expect bugs to multiply on bugs, but you can thankfully have both the old stable and new canary versions installed alongside one another. Either way, some of the new changes with things like Gradle will require that you update your stuff at some point. It might be worth backing things up and updating your Gradle plugin just to test if anything breaks.

One of his most popular, and the one that I use the most, is AutoVoice. Basically, the plugin listens to and hijacks Google Now commands to trigger Tasker profiles — I had a simple one that would turn on my PC via Wake On LAN when I said "Okay, Google. Turn on my computer." Now v3.0 has been officially released and brings some awesome Home, Echo, and IFTTT integrations as well as natural language commands. This is not exactly new if you used the AutoVoice beta. However, this now being official is great for those of you who either didn't want to deal with beta stuff or haven't experienced the beautiful frustration that is Tasker. Seriously, now is a great time to get started.    There are two ways to trigger AutoVoice through either your Home or Echo. You can direct your personal assistant to open the service by saying "Open AutoVoice" after the appropriate trigger phrase and follow with the command you want. Or you can say "Ask AutoVoice to say [insert command here]," after which AutoVoice will speak the appropriate phrase to any connected devices – the example is "Hello."    On another notable... note, v3.0 also brings natural language support for AutoVoice commands. This means that you don't have to remember your exact voice command trigger. This is not just great for Tasker, but it also works with the Home and Echo. There is a subscription for the latter part: $0.99/month. Things here can get pretty complicated with complex commands, but the natural language will sift through what you say to get the proper triggers. IFTTT recipes can also be activated via natural language though AutoVoice, too. As with many things involving Tasker, there is a steep learning curve. Still, part of the fun is the trial and error and getting the profiles and tasks to work just right. Further challenges come when trying to streamline them for efficiency, which is a whole other beast altogether. If you're stuck or need some inspiration, Mr. Dias has kindly made several tutorials which you can find in the source link. More resources like the Google+ community and the Tasker subreddit are available, too. To get started, you need to purchase Tasker ($2.99) and download AutoVoice. The latter comes with a free trial before you need to purchase the full version for $2.49. After that, you can get rolling.

I wish alexa and google assistant was smart enough without having to keep saying "Alexa" or "hey/ok google".... PerhapsNever True. But, there are still privacy concerns. In order to be smart enough to know that a conversation is ongoing, it would have to keep the microphone active. There are quite a few people that wouldn't be happy with that. BlackHawkRider . I am one of those people who are into technology. Privacy is the least of my concern in the digital era. Also, I have to agree that an always listening mic will be annoying to lots of people....at least having the flexibility to communicate with the intelligent devices would have been nice. Instead of saying stuff like, "Hey Google, [commands]" or "Alexa [commands]" constantly, it would be nice to make it more natural to talk to the device (despite how stupid you will probably look). Stuff like, "what is on my agenda for today google" or something of the similar line. PerhapsNever I'm the same. I was just playing devil's advocate. LOL However, rather than always-on listening or conversation mode, I want multiple commands in a single utterance. For instance, "Hey Google, turn on the living room lights and set the AC to 72 degrees." would be AWESOME. But, being able to have the key phrase at the tail of sentence would be cool too (as you stated). BlackHawkRider . multiple command is definitely a must! repeatedly telling google or alexa, "turn off bedroom light", "turn off living room light", etc.... is annoying. Simply saying "turn off the bedroom AND living room light" is much more natural and smarter. Is it really that difficult to code a multi-variable recognition for a command? PerhapsNever RIGHT? I kind of solved it a bit using virtual switches in SmartThings to where I can tell Google to turn on or off various switches to achieve effects like that. I've also been playing with IFTTT and custom commands, but still nothing close to multiple commands. BlackHawkRider . I was planning on doing something similar using the Maker Channel in IFTTT and use my extra raspberry pi as the hub which process the commands through a custom script and control the smart devices in the house. However, I didn't want to go through the trouble to do that and currently waiting for Google to get a bit smarter and improve Google Assistant to do that for me. jim No thanks. To much crap to go through and I'm not paying a buck a month either , had it in my phone and deleted both Suraj Padamsali I am already annoyed by the OK Google. Now, I also have to say 'ask autovoice'. João Dias You don't need to pay the subscription if you don't plan on using natural language. Normal commands are free to use. prwnd How is it possible that Tasker ($2.99) is uploaded to ApkMirror by Artem himself? Vladimir Even if it is a payed app the licence is still checked against your Google account when you start it. prwnd My colleague downloaded and installed Tasker from ApkMirror and using it without problem (he didn't buy). Licence checking is not implemented in Tasker in my opinion, or don't know why it works for him. Artem Russakovskii It's possible because it's published here: http://tasker.dinglisch.net/download.html. Ed G We've reached the point in society where saying two words is now "annoying". verboze Yes indeed. I rather only utter one word, takes too much oxygen for both. Side note: "ok google" is just plain boring, no personality. mchalakov Using Tasker is more difficult than being a web dev :D verboze This is one of the best promo videos I've seen for an app recently. It's funny, but not over the top "professional" grade. It's instructive, and shows real possibilities and real life usage. And while it's a little long, it captures the core features early on, and keeps me engaged enough to watch the rest! Great job João! João Dias Wow, thank you! :D You actually described precisely what I was going for! Awesome to know that it came across exactly as I intended it, thanks!

The Quick Access feature in Google Drive for Android is coming to Drive on the web Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 1:19pm PDTMay 18, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 34 Share on Twitter Total Shares69 Google News The Quick Access feature from Google Drive, previously an exclusive to the Drive app, will now be coming to the site. Once it is live, you'll be able to see the files Google thinks you are most likely to need at a given time right at the top of your list. We aren't seeing it on our end quite yet, but Google just announced the feature today. Google seems to be taking a pretty general approach to applying their machine learning tech, tossing it wherever it might stick. And, the benefits may be small, but the few seconds saved via each new application can cumulatively save us a whole lot of time. For instance, Google found that the predictive machine learning tech in the Quick Access feature on Android saved almost half the time it took to find the file you need. Those of us with an extensive setup in Google Drive will appreciate the time saved searching. Google's post implies that the new features should be available on Drive soon. For G Suite customers it is set to a 15-day rollout on the "Rapid" release track scheduled for June 13th. If you'd like to see what Quick Access looks like on Android and don't have Drive installed, you can pull it down over at APKMirror or on the Google Play Store.

Now any developer can make instant apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

(on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app?

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Accessories Our favorite Roomba robot vacuum can now be controlled by Google Assistant Maren Estrada May 18th, 2017 at 5:54 PM Share Tweet The annual Google I/O conference took place on Wednesday, and we heard all about Google’s new hardware and software products Google is developing. Of course, Google Assistant was one of the main focuses during the company’s keynote, since everything these days is about AI and machine learning. Google’s announcements surrounding Assistant were great, but there was another cool development with Google Assistant that happened offstage on Wednesday. For the first time, Roomba vacuums will support Google Assistant! Support was added to two different models, including our favorite, the iRobot Roomba 960 Robotic Vacuum Cleaner. “iRobot is aggressively pursuing opportunities within the connected home to improve our customers’ experience with our cleaning robots,” iRobot CEO Colin Angle said in a statement. “Voice-command devices have found great success in the marketplace and it’s clear that customers are demanding easier ways to interact with a growing number of products and technologies throughout the home.” Here’s everything else you need to know from the product page: iAdapt 2.0 Navigation with Visual Localization enables Roomba to navigate and clean an entire level of your home Runs for up to 75 minutes, then automatically recharges and resumes cleaning to complete the entire job iRobot HOME App lets you clean, schedule & set custom cleaning preferences from your smartphone AeroForce 3-Stage Cleaning System delivers improved cleaning performance Tangle-free extractors prevent hair and debris jams iRobot Roomba 960 Robotic Vacuum Cleaner $698.47 Available from Amazon BGR may receive a commission Buy Now Follow @BGRDeals on Twitter to keep up with the latest and greatest deals we find around the web.

By Harry McCracken5 minute Read At last year’s Google I/O keynote, CEO Sundar Pichai laid out the company’s vision for a new era of AI-first computing. AI mattered at least as much at this year’s keynote on Wednesday. But instead of being a vision, it was more of a fact of life. That’s because it was everywhere–in Android, Google Photos, the Google Home speaker, the Google Assistant (which will add a machine-vision feature called Google Lens), and more. advertisement John Giannandrea After the keynote, I caught up with Google senior VP of engineering John Giannandrea–who, though he didn’t appear onstage, is deeply involved in all of the above efforts and others as the company’s lead for AI. “Last year, we talked about becoming an AI-first company and people weren’t entirely sure what we meant,” he told me. With this year’s announcements, it’s not only understandable but tangible. The news from I/O that Giannandrea and I discussed was as wide-ranging as the keynote itself: Intelligence Everywhere At I/O, Google announced Google.ai–which is maybe less of an actual thing than a statement (and accompanying website) designed to remind the world of the company’s ambitious and far-flung efforts in AI. Giannandrea calls it “an umbrella brand” that shows off Google’s work in hopes of inspiring others to build upon it. “We’re saying, ‘Come use this amazing stuff, see what you can do,” he explains. It’s not just about Google’s own apps, services, and gadgets. The AI techniques created by Giannandrea’s team may make their way into Google products such as Lens; be turned into on-demand Google Cloud offerings that can power other companies’ software and services; be leveraged in research efforts such as the company’s work to identify breast-cancer tumors; and be open-sourced so that anyone can use and tweak them for purposes beyond Google’s own ambitions. “We see our job as evangelizing this new shift in computing,” Giannandrea says. Giving Google A Lens I knew that Google Lens–which will be part of both the Assistant and Google Photos–scratches a long-standing Google itch because I remember Google Googles, an app which launched way, way back in 2010. Conceptually, they’re the same thing: You aim your phone’s camera at something in the real world, and AI understands what it’s seeing and does something useful for you. It’s just that some of the things Lens will do–such as reading a Wi-Fi password off the sticker on the back of a Wi-Fi router and then logging you in–would have sounded like fantasy in 2010. (Heck, that sounds a tad fanciful even in 2017.) Giannandrea says that Lens isn’t the result of any particular breakthrough, but rather slow and steady process in machine vision–and, particularly, the fact that the technology is getting better at avoiding false-positive and false-negative identifications. “Computers have just been getting better at seeing,” he says. advertisement A Google TPU AI (Not) In The Cloud If you think of Google performing AI, you’re likely to envision a data center full of servers crunching numbers in the cloud. On that front, the I/O keynote included the announcement of a second-generation version of the ultra-powerful machine learning-optimized hardware it calls a Cloud TPU. (“It’s exciting to have 180 teraflops of hardware devoted to learning,” Giannandrea cheerfully says.) But Google is also at work on AI-infused technologies that run directly on mobile devices, an approach that has gotten more effective as it’s learned how to perform AI more efficiently and gadgets have gotten more powerful GPUs, the chips that are suited to the high-speed calculations required by AI. TensorFlow Lite, a new offshoot of Google’s open-source TensorFlow software for creating machine-learning applications, runs directly on Android devices, enabling features such as new features in Android O that are smart enough, for instance, to notice that the text you’re trying to highlight is an address. It wouldn’t work nearly as smoothly if it had to talk to a server across an internet connection. “You want to do machine learning on the device as much as you possibly can,” Giannandrea says. “It’s lower latency, it’s closer to the user, it’s distributed.” Getting It Right, Again And Again Google Home recently gained the ability to distinguish between up to six different people’s voices–a key upgrade because it unlocks the potential for the Google Assistant service to know who’s talking and respond with more customized information, such as details about travel plans drawn from a specific person’s Gmail, for instance. I knew that telling voices apart was an impressive feat because my colleague Jared Newman wrote an entire story in March about how hard it was. “We were pretty proud to get that out the door,” Giannandrea told me. He added that the challenge, as with many uses of machine learning, is not to prove it can work in a lab environment, but to make it so rock-solid reliable that it’s ready to use in the real world and is more likely to impress people rather than tick them off. “It’s all precision recall,” he says. “When it doesn’t work, it can be embarassing.” Matching People With Jobs Pichai concluded the I/O keynote by previewing Google for Jobs, an upcoming career search engine that uses machine learning to understand job listings–a new approach that is valuable, Giannandrea says, even though looking for a job has been a largely digital activity for years. “They don’t do a very good job of classifying the jobs,” Giannandrea says. “It’s not just that I’m looking for part-time work within five miles of my house–I’m looking for an accounting job that involves bookkeeping.” advertisement I wondered if the fact that Google Jobs was the keynote’s final bit of news was an oblique acknowledgement of concerns that AI will eliminate jobs on an unprecedented level in the coming years. Declaring himself “pretty optimistic” about AI’s potential to make the world a better place, Giannandrea said that countering dystopian fears wasn’t the intent. “It’s really a reflection of the fact we want to make tools that are useful for everybody,” he says. “There’s a perception that technology isn’t as relevnt for every demographic. We strongly believe technology should help everybody, no matter what they’re trying to do.” Challenges To Come Google has worked its AI into so many aspects of so many of its ventures over the past year that I asked Giannandrea whether he thought it could keep up the pace in the years to come. “I actually think we’re speeding up the rate of acceleration,” he told me. “But it’s obvious there are problems we don’t have solutions for.” For instance, as uncannily effective as Google search can be, and despite the power of its knowledge graph, computers don’t truly understand what humans write. Google would like to teach them to “read anything and summarize anything,” Giannandrea says. Another big challenge is to create machine-learning technologies that can understand facts about the world with less training. Giannandrea notes that his 4-year-old daughter saw an old-school penny-farthing bicycle, knew it was a bike, and–once he’d told her about it–was set to identify penny-farthings from then on. Today’s computers would need a lot more data to learn the same thing. “We’d have to show them 100,000 penny-farthings and tell them it’s a bike,” Giannandrea says. Then–looking on the bright side–he adds that “once they’d seen 100,000, they’d probably be better at identifying them than humans are.” About the author Harry McCracken is the technology editor for Fast Company, based in San Francisco.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai and a succession of company execs took the stage to talk up the latest milestones and to unveil new and upcoming products. Among the new goodies: updates to Android, Google Home, Google Assistant and YouTube. As well as nifty new services like Google Lens, which uses your smarpthone's camera to identify objects in the real world.  And Google highlighted the expansive reach of its platform, with its Android operating system now installed on 2 billion devices.  Here's all the new stuff Google unveiled at I/O 2017.   Google is rolling out "Smart Reply" to over 1 billion users of Gmail on Android and iOS. The feature uses Google's machine learning capabilities to respond to emails for you.   Google Lens is an impressive technology that allows your phone to recognize objects in the real world and take helpful actions. Point your phone at a WiFi router, for example, and Lens will show you the right password. Point your phone at a restaurant on the street and Lens finds online info about the restaurant. Lens isn't a standalone app, but rather a technology that will be baked into other Google apps, starting with Google Photos this summer. By the way, Pinterest trolled Google I/O on Twitter over the announcement of Google Lens. Pinterest has already released its own app, called Pinterest Lens, which does a similar thing. AI and machine learning is a big focus for Google. It announced "Cloud TPU" which is a cloud service for training machine learning apps. It is essentially a very fast, very big computer that app developers can rent as a cloud service. Autodraw. This is an "AI experiment" tool that was released a couple of weeks ago. It helps you learn to draw by automatically guessing what you sketched and serving up a better version. “Even I can draw with this thing," Pichai said. Google added a lot of new features to Google Assistant, Google's answer to Siri and Cortana. The big news: Assistant, which was released on Android last year, is now available on the iPhone. Google also added the ability to type to Assistant on your phone, so you don't need to talk out loud to it, and Google added support for more languages.   Google Assistant also now has a software development kit to let app developers connect their their services to Google Assistant (and to devices that use the virtual assistant like Google Home). Google is getting serious about taking on Amazon Alexa. Assistant will soon work with Google Lens, too. So you can point your phone at something, such as a concert hall marquee, and Google Assistant will add the event to your calendar. And you can do entire transactions on Assistant, too, such as verbally ordering takeout from a restaurant that supports Assistant. Google handles all of it, including the payment and the receipt.   Google also added four new features to Google Home, its smart speaker that competes with Amazon Echo. Google added something called "Proactive Assistance," so that the device will automatically notify you of things like traffic delays and flight status changes. But the big news is Hands-Free Calling, available later this year Just say, "Call Mom" and Google Home will place a call to anyone in the US or Canada for free. It will recognize your voice, too. Google Home has improved its music and entertainment options. You can now stream Spotify, Soundcloud and other music services on the sleek little speaker. All Home devices will also get Bluetooth features as well. Google Home now offers "Visual Responses" which allows it to interact with your TV. Tell Home what you want to watch, and the speaker will cue up the video on your TV. Ask Home about your schedule that day, and you can browse your calendar on the big screen. Google also added new features to Photos such as Suggested Share, which reminds you to share your best photos with the other folks pictured in the photo. There's also Shared Libraries, which lets you share all of your photos with another person, such as your spouse. And there's Photo Books, which lets you create hardcopy photo albums that Google will print out and send to you. YouTube introduced a new feature to its 360 Video app. It was available on phones and the DayDream VR headset before. But now you can can use it on your TV. Using your remote you can pan around the video. It's especially good for travel videos or concerts. YouTube also promised it will bring Live360 to TV programming, meaning watching live streamed events on the TV and being able to pan around the scene. YouTube also updated its Super Chat feature for commenting on live videos, adding a way for the audience to actually control what happens in a video. Viewers of a video can pay to have things happen in a live broadcast (with the broadcaster's OK). YouTube demoed this with YouTube stars The Slow Mo Guys. They agreed to get pelted with water balloons to raise $500 for charity.   Google also showed off new features in Android O, the new version of Android coming this fall. It's not a major update, but there are some new things worth highlighting. For example, you can now use picture-in-picture video, so you can watch video or video chat while doing other stuff on your phone. Other features include, auto select where you can double tap on an address or phone number and it selects all of it, linked to maps or the phone app.   Google also added new features in Android O for developers such as security and battery life improvements. The biggest news was that Google is adding support for a new developer language called Kotlin. You can download a beta version of Android O starting Wednesday if you have a Google Pixel phone. Google also announced Android Go, a new program to make its mobile apps work better on low-end entry level phones.   And it showed off virtual reality, too. The big news is that Google's Daydream VR platform now supports standalone headsets, not headsets that need to be powered by smartphones. HTC and Lenovo will be two of the first companies to make standalone Daydream VR headsets that launch later this year. Google also beefed up Expeditions with an Augmented reality mode. Expeditions is an app for classrooms launched 2 years ago. Now, using a phone with AR mode, pictures are overlaid on top of the images on the app. Finally, Google introduced Google for Jobs, an app that takes data from job posting sites and makes it easier to search, using machine learning and AI to help narrow and personalize the search for you (such as figuring out your commute time).

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry.

I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see.

At its annual outdoor developer festival and tanning experiment, Google I/O, the Chocolate Factory presented minions to talk up the arrival of standalone VR headsets from HTC and Lenovo toward the end of the year. By severing the tether to a PC, this self-contained face-hugging hardware will free wearers to bump into furniture and other tangible objects. And it may make participating in VR a bit more fun. Google is providing a technology called Worldsense for these gizmos that will enable positional tracking without external sensors. Tracking how objects like a person's hands move in the real world is necessary to present them in a virtual world. The aim of the game is to help the wearer escape from our crazy reality into a believable albeit made-up happier place, after all. Right now, before these standalone devices arrive, the Daydream platform's $80 View gadget is some goggles you slip your Android phone into, with the display beamed into your eyes: Six months after this Daydream kit debuted late last year, there are more than 150 VR apps. And with the arrival of a Daydream update for the Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ this summer and the release of LG's next flagship phone, there will be 11 Daydream-compatible devices, in case anyone is keeping score. Google calls this momentum. Check back after the holidays for actual sales figures. Daydream consists of software development kits (SDKs) for Android, Unity, and Unreal Engine 4. Apps that meet design and functional quality requirements – Motion Intensity level must be specified, for example, so users are forewarned of potential motion sickness – can look forward to Google publishing support in the Play Store. And clearly support is necessary to help VR reach mainstream appeal. Established developers and content creators have reportedly received six-figure financial support from Google, to seed the pool of available titles. The VR market, however, appears still to be a money pit. Facebook's Oculus tried funding VR content creation through its in-house production arm Story Studio, only to shutter the digital entertainment mill earlier this month. Worse still, unit sales of VR headsets have underwhelmed. VR, OH #IO17: "They're not doing anything interesting. They're just making it less of a shitty experience of a 20-year-old alone in a room." — Thomas Claburn (@ThomasClaburn) May 18, 2017 In an online post Wednesday, Google virtual reality veep Clay Bavor took stock of the state of VR and AR efforts. He acknowledged that the next step for the industry isn't clear because "everything needs to get better." Several of those presenting during Google's VR and AR keynote said it was "still early days," Google's favorite phrase for half-baked. "Our goal here is really to raise all boats by doing heavy lifting," Bavor said on stage, as if Google were a rising tide rather than a company with a financial interest in VR. Echoing his published thoughts, Bavor attempted to frame Google's various VR and AR projects as part of the spectrum of immersive computing. Immersive computing, he said, is important because it has the potential to change how we interact with computers. Indeed, developers now have the opportunity to reimagine tired desktop and mobile interaction models. Unfortunately, it will take time to figure out what works and what leads to eyestrain, nausea, and headaches. But progress is being made. Google has taken its Tango real-time 3D location mapping technology and rolled it into a service called "Visual Positioning Service" or VPS. Evidently no one at the company thought this might confuse people using virtual private servers. Showing little faith in the guidance of retail employees or aisle-based signage, Google imagines that vendors like Lowe's will be able to map their facilities with millimeter precision using VPS to do things like direct phone-toting customers to specific products in retail spaces. No specific release date was mentioned, though the technology is active in a few Lowe's locations, apparently. Google anticipates indoor location mapping will be useful in conjunction with a variety of services, including its AR smartphone camera tech, Google Lens. Mike Jazayeri, director of product management for Daydream, said that in conjunction with Google's plan to launch standalone headsets, Daydream has received a software update dubbed Euphrates. It includes a VR window manager in Android, so system UI elements are accessible in VR on devices that lack a touchscreen, he said. He also announced the addition of screen capture and Google Cast support, so VR apps can transmit imagery to nearby Chromecast devices and share them through social media. "It really brings your friends and family into the fun with you," he said. Sharing, he said, "is critical to keep people engaged." Meanwhile, don't forget, while using virtual reality to escape actual reality, ads are coming to your VR world one way or another. ® Tips and corrections 5 Comments MORE Google Virtual Reality Sign up to our Newsletter Get IT in your inbox daily Subscribe More from The Register US judges say you can Google Google, but you can't google Google The Chocolate Factory is spared the aspirin treatment by the 9th District Court 58 Comments Google's PHP API client has XSS vulnerability Patch promised Google opens patent pool for Android Protects against trolls maybe.

Elyse Betters18 May 2017Apps Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google Assistant has arrived on the iPhone. Sure, technically, the AI-powered assistant was already available in a limited fashion through the Google Allo messaging app, but now, thanks to a new standalone app available on Apple's App Store (US-only for now), you can take full advantage of Google Assistant and start barking commands at it like you can with Siri. But can it replace Apple's default voice assistant? We played with it a bit to find out. What is Android Go and why does it matter? How to get Android O on your phone right now Apple's Siri speaker: What's the story so far? Pocket-lint What is Google Assistant? Google Assistant is Google's version of an assistant - just like Apple has Siri and Microsoft has Cortana and Amazon has Alexa and Samsung has Bixby and so on. Pocket-lint has an in-depth guide on Google Assistant that details everything you need to know, including which devices and apps it is currently found in, how it works, what it can do, and the types of functionality it offers per device. Pocket-lint How does Google Assistant on iPhone work? Setup First, download the free Google Assistant app from Apple's App Store and log in to your Google account. It is only available in the US at launch. It will ask for access to your location and microphone. Then, you'll be brought to the chat screen in the app and told about the types of things you can ask. If you need help or what to know more about what Google Assistant can do, just ask: "What can you do?" Ask a question To ask a question, tap the microphone icon at the bottom of the chat screen and ask your question, or tap the keyboard icon to the left of the microphone icon to bring up a keyboard and manually input your question to Google Assistant. Explore In the top right of the chat screen, there's a blue icon. Tap it to access the more options in the Assistant app. The screen that pops up will have two tabs: Explore and Your Stuff. Explore suggests different things you can ask Google Assistant and recommends various tie-ins (also known as "skills" on the Cortana and Alexa platforms). For instance, you ask Assistant to play a song in Spotify. Your Stuff The second tab we mentioned (under more options), Your Stuff, is where you can go to see all your Assistant-related stuff in one place, such as your reminders, agenda, and shopping list. You can also tap next to each section to begin adding reminders, events, shopping items, etc. Settings Under more options, and then next to the Your Stuff tab, you will see three horizontal dots. This icon opens up a card that provides access to your account, settings, activity, and additional features like help and send feedback. Select Account to manage which Google account is linked to the Assistant app. Settings will let you add payment options and manage devices and services (like your Google Home or Spotify account), while Activity shows a history of everything you've done with Assistant. Pocket-lint What can Assistant do that Siri can't? For the purposes of this guide, we're focusing on how Google Assistant on the iPhone compares to Siri on the iPhone. Launching your assistant The first obvious difference is that Siri is baked into iOS, while Google Assistant is a standalone app you need to download. You can easily access Siri by holding down the iPhone's home button, but with Google Assistant (and Cortana, Alexa, and all other third-party assistants), you need to launch a separate app. And on Android phones, Google Assistant is immediately there and ready. The other thing worth mentioning is that you can't remap your Home button so that it launches an assistant other than Siri. Also, when you first launch the Google Assistant app on your iPhone, you have to log in to a Google account. Siri doesn't have this step when you first use it on the iPhone, though, technically, it quietly works with the Apple ID you used to sign into your device. Calls and texts If you're wondering whether you can make a call or send a message on the iPhone with Google Assistant, you can, but it's not exactly seamless. When you say, "Call Dad," for instance, Assistant will bring up his name and launch a phone call you can then cancel or confirm. If you say, "Text Dad," it asks for your message and launches your Messages app. Siri can send messages without opening an app. Playing music You can play music using Google Assistant, but again, the experience is muddled. When you first ask Google Assistant to play music, it'll ask you to choose between Apple Music and YouTube as a default. We chose YouTube and said, "Play AC/DC." It then launched the YouTube app and played a random song from the band. We went back to Assistant and said "Play Father John Misty," and it served up a list of albums. At that point we asked Assistant to play a song "on Apple Music" and it did so. From what we can tell it switched Apple Music to our default. We then couldn't figure out how to change YouTube to the default again. So, this feature still needs tweaking, in our opinion. Now, with Siri, you can ask it to play music, and it'll always play it on Apple Music and give you the option to open Apple Music. Google apps Google Assistant works well with Google's own apps. You can send an email through Gmail (say who you want to send the email to, and it'll open the Gmail app; ask for directions with Google Maps instead of Apple's maps, etc). Now, with Siri, your email will always go through Apple's Mail app and can be done without opening the app, but you can also ask Siri to open some third-party apps, including Google Maps. Shortcuts Unlike Siri, Google Assistant lets you set up quick shortcuts (under the Your Stuff tab) to customise Assistant. So, for instance, you can say "Be right there" to trigger a text to your husband that says you're 10 minutes away. "Make me laugh" could bring up fail videos on YouTube. Restrictions There are some iOS restrictions that limit what Google Assistant can do. The Your Stuff tab in the Google Assistant app lists that you set reminders, an agenda, and a shopping list. However, Google Assistant still can't set alarms, launch the camera to take selfies (or launch any app on command), post to social networks like Twitter or Facebook, call a ride-hailing app like Ubers or Lyft, etc. You also can't launch third-party apps like Whatsapp to send a message. But Siri can do all that. That said, Google Assistant can handle setting reminders with a place and time, while Siri can only place what you requested on Apple's Reminders list. Explore Speaking of third-party apps, Apple has opened up Siri to developers, but you'll have to ask Siri what she can do and play around to figure things out yourself. With Google Assistant app, however, there is an Explore tab full of suggestions on what you can do with Assistant. We particularly like that Assistant offers access to other chatbots, like Genius, which guesses the name of a song based on a snippet. Context Google Assistant is better at remembering context. For instance, when we asked, "Who's the Queen of England," and followed it up with "How old is she?" Google Assistant responded with "Elizabeth II" and "5-feet and 4 inches tall." Siri, meanwhile, answered the first question but responded with "I don't know" for the second. We also think Siri can't understand voice commands as well as Google. Pocket-lint Want to know more?

And pretty soon, the artificial intelligence-powered assistant could find its way onto a number of devices. At its I/O Developer Conference, Google vice president of engineering Scott Huffman announced that Google Assistant would be available as an app for iOS devices starting today (May 17). While Google didn't share many details as to how the app will work — presumably, you'll have to launch the app to use it instead of triggering it with your voice like you would on a Pixel — the move to the iPhone expands Google Assistant beyond the 100 million Android devices that currently support it. MORE: 10 Siri Tips and Tricks Every iPhone User Should Know If Google has its way, you'll soon be interacting with its Assistant on devices other than the iPhone, Android devices and the Google Home speaker. Google is releasing a new Assistant SDK that will let device makers put the assistant on "speakers, toys, drink-mixing robots, whatever crazy device you can think of," Huffman said. Assistant is also gaining some new skills. The most impressive one will be integration with the newly unveiled Google Lens feature, which uses the camera on your phone to identify objects. That sounds a lot like the Bixby Vision feature Samsung is adding to its Galaxy S8 phone, but Google's adding its own twist on the feature, letting you act on Assistant's visual recognition prowess. In a demo, Huffman talked about how Google Lens will let you point at the marquee of a theater hosting an upcoming concert. Google Assistant will be able to recognize the name of the band, and with a tap, you can perform actions like call up songs from that band, order tickets or add the concert to your calendar. Other features in Google Lens touted by CEO Sundar Pichai include the ability to pull up restaurant reviews by pointing your camera at an eatery or adding Wi-Fi login information via the camera. While Google Assistant is primarily voice-powered, the phone version of the assistant will gain another input method. You'll be able to type queries for those times when you're out in public and don't want to speak your Google Assistant requests out loud. Google plans to add support for more languages to Google Assistant. French, German, Brazilian Portuguese and Japanese are rolling out this summer. Italian, Spanish and Korean will arrive by the end of the year. Google Assistant on the phone will also add support for Google Actions, which will let third parties integrate services into the assistant. To demo the feature, a Google rep used the Google Assistant to order food from Panera, using her voice to place the order and paying for it with a fingerprint through Google Pay.

Posted: Thursday, May 18, 2017 5:37 PM EDT Updated: Thursday, May 18, 2017 5:37 PM EDT By Heather Kelly SAN FRANCISCO (CNNMoney) -- Virtual reality can be lonely. For all of the overwrought promises about the futuristic technology connecting people, it's a pretty isolating experience. The hardware shuts out any view or sound of people physically near you, not many people own headsets yet, and interactions inside virtual settings are still limited. Google is working on new features that could fix some of that. Unfortunately, it might involve hanging out in the VR version of a YouTube comments section. The company announced the next steps for its virtual and augmented reality technology on Thursday at its annual I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California. Google is releasing a major update to its virtual reality platform, Daydream. It's the software that will run on its own Daydream View goggles as well as the standalone headsets that third parties like Lenovo are creating later this year. Google also makes the Daydream View, a low-tech VR headset that uses a smartphone. In the new version of Daydream, called Euphrates, you can broadcast what you see in virtual reality to a regular TV over a Chromecast. That way any friends or family members hanging out in your home can see what you see. The popularity of services like Twitch, which live streams other people playing video games, has shown there's a demand for this type of sharing. If no one's nearby, you can take a screenshot or record a video of what you see, like a level of a VR game. Post them on social media or share directly over text or email. If you've alienated all your local friends by making them watch you play video games, there's a new option for hanging out with other VR users. YouTube is working on an update to its VR app that will let people watch the same videos together in virtual "shared rooms." The feature will allow a limited number of people to view the same 360-degree videos simultaneously while speaking to each other over voice chat. You can also see what videos other people are watching and jump in. The rooms are public, so your customizable avatar is interacting with everyone else using the YouTube VR app. That makes it more like a spoken, virtual version of a YouTube comments section than a closed social app like Facebook's Spaces. Google does plan to include safety features such as the ability to leave a group or block someone at anytime. Google is also bringing other staples of the old fashioned 2D internet into VR. It's adding support for its Chrome web browser, so you can browse websites. All the new features are coming later this year. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

Google is preparing Daydream 2.0, Chrome VR, and new tools for virtual/augmented reality developers Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 1:49pm PDTMay 18, 2017 6 Plus 1 on G+ 28 Share on Facebook 32 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Daydream Google News Project Tango Videos VR In all of the hubbub of yesterday's I/O keynote, Google took some time to mention a few changes and additions coming to Daydream and Tango, its virtual and augmented reality platforms respectively. While we got some interesting news about Standalone and WorldSense, Google has revealed more information about what we can expect from the future of VR/AR. There isn't a whole ton of new information at the moment, but I've split things up so that you can find what catches your fancy. Daydream 2.0 (Euphrates) Not only are more devices becoming Daydream-ready, but Google is preparing version 2.0 of the platform. Codenamed Euphrates, the focus will be on making "VR more fun and easier to share with others" — because people, for some reason, want to share their VR experiences with others. One of the new features to accomplish this is the ability to capture and cast what you're seeing so that others can partake of your virtual adventure, whether in the same room as you or at some later time. Admittedly, I am being quite glib about this, but it's really an interesting path to take. Being able to share what you're seeing and experiencing seems to be something that people enjoy (not entirely sure when that happened), so it's a good thing that Google is making such a thing possible. The other of the two mentioned additions coming in Euphrates is related to YouTube. Google says that it will be possible to "watch YouTube videos in VR with other people and share the experience in the same virtual space." I take this to mean that two people could both watch the same video simultaneously in their separate headsets. From the gif below, the people in the party have their own videos that they're watching, so I have to wonder if this party system functions like the queue on Chromecasts. If true, I can see this being fun and entertaining. Dev tools As Google puts it, we need developers to create the immersive content that VR and Daydream need to succeed. To facilitate this, the company is providing devs with two new tools: Instant Preview and Seurat. Instant Preview allows for devs to see their changes immediately on the headset, versus waiting for the build process (which could significantly increase production time). Basically, it's an Android app on the Daydream viewer that hooks into the editors for the Unity or Unreal engines. It supports either the Full VR or Controller-only preview modes — the former is reflective of all changes made; the latter shows controller-only data when iterating on interactions for games and the like. Seurat is the more interesting and in-depth of the two, so I'll try to keep it brief. This technology allows a mobile GPU to render desktop-class (or better), high-fidelity graphics in real time. Google only mentions that Seurat uses "clever tricks" to accomplish this, but whatever magic it's pulling, consider me deeply intrigued. If this is utilized properly (and Google isn't just blowing smoke), the new Standalone headsets just became that much more attractive. Chrome VR/AR Wrapping all of this up, Google reiterated its commitment to the web and allowing developers to spread their content to everyone, regardless of device (desktop, phone, VR/AR, etc). In light of its contributions to WebVR, the company announced that Chrome VR will come to Daydream this summer, allowing you to browse the web in virtual reality. Not leaving out augmented reality, there's actually a new Chromium build out right now with a new AR API that you can try for yourself.

Now any developer can make instant apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

If you were already using them, you'd have them installed and have no need for an instant app. boop I've yet to figure out how instant apps work. DieselBeats Basically the experience of the app without having to download it. It's moreso if you are really only going to use the app once so it's not just hogging up space on your phone and never being used. boop I now that much. I mean I've never been able to pull one up. Sruly J Do you have the Google Play Services for Instant Apps app installed? Michel S. weird, why can't I find that in the Play Store? (on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app?

[Update: Starts today] Google Assistant is coming to all Android 6.0 and above devices Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/02 8:10am PDTMar 2, 2017 244 Plus 1 on G+ 833 Share on Facebook 222 Share on Twitter Total Shares1299 Google Marshmallow 6.0 News Nougat 7.0/7.1 Videos Update 1: 2017/03/02 8:14am PST And right on time, it looks like the Assistant rollout to non-Pixel Android M and N devices is starting today. Google already published a short YouTube video ad and a I guess it was bound to happen: Google Assistant is finally breaking free from the shackles of the Pixels and launching onto the millions of devices running Android 6.0 Marshmallow and above, no need for GApps or root. But this shouldn't come as a surprise to you. The signs were there all along. Despite being revealed as a Pixel exclusive on phones in the Android 7.1 changelog, Assistant has been available through Allo on all Android 4.1+ phones, announced for all Android TV 6.0+ devices, and was shortly enabled by mistake through an alpha version of the Google app on non-Pixel phones. Actually, it was that same alpha app that gave us plenty of hints that Assistant would be coming to more Android devices. Plus, we've known for a while that the new LG G6 should have the Assistant, which hinted, if not confirmed, that the Pixel exclusivity was not long for this world. And now the news is official in conjunction with the launch of the LG G6. Google says the Assistant will start rolling this week to Marshmallow and Nougat devices for English users in the US followed by Australia, Canada, and the UK, plus German speakers in Germany. More languages will be added later. It will replace Google Search, launching with a long press of the home button or the "OK Google" voice command. We don't know yet if it'll require an update to Play Services or if it'll be a server-side switch, but we'll sure update you either way. As for what you can do with Assistant, think of it as an evolution of Google Search and "OK Google," with a bit of added functionality like smart home controls, remembering things, and an open API developers can plug into. However, don't be surprised if you notice that Assistant on your phone is still oddly missing some features that Google Search has had for a while, like recognizing songs, reading messages, and adding items to specific Google Keep lists. The hope is that when Assistant launches on non-Pixels this week, it will truly replace Google Search and not lack any commands users have been issuing for years, or disappointment will ensue. The even bigger hope is that the fragmentation of what you can do with Assistant on phones, Home, Wear, and Allo (not to mention TV and Auto when they are available) will no longer exist. Well, one can dream. Update 1: 2017/03/02 8:14am PST And right on time, it looks like the Assistant rollout to non-Pixel Android M and N devices is starting today. Google already published a short YouTube video ad and a tweet to let everyone know this is happening now. Now rolling out to more @Android phones, it’s time to meet your #GoogleAssistant → https://t.co/tu9bGCgo7F pic.twitter.com/aeWdgBTJH1 — Google (@Google) March 2, 2017 Let us know if you've started seeing Assistant on your devices and check whether that involved a new Play Services version or was simply a server-side switch. Remember, the rollout is limited to English users in the US first, so you may not see it if you live overseas or if you have chosen another default language in your Google settings.

I'm not looking for an experimental interactive experience Scarlett how do u revert back? Joe Beach Go to languages, choose English, then choose US Virgin islands. After that swap the Virgin islands to the top as primary. Then no more garbage assistant Scarlett it doesnt show that for me :/ Scarlett i just uninstalled all the updates on the google app, fixed it for me, not putting up with shitty assistant Joe Beach Doesn't work on pixel. Not sure what to do if that doesn't work SavageJeep Why? I hear people saying No On Tap or missing this but I have seen little functionality lost. Joe Beach Obviously everything is personal preference. To me a smartphone is a tool. I'm not going to start talking to ratchets and hammers or phones. I definitely don't want any of them to talk back to me. IMO all they need to do is put a switch in settings where you can choose Google Now over assistant​. This is an attempt to best apple in something but I think Siri is stupid, along with assistant. I'm not alone on this. It slows anything I want to do down also. SavageJeep Have you tried it. You don't have to talk to it if you don't want to. Go into Google via the app or the search bar and everything is the same, cards, weather, news... Manbir Maan 8 Am in India. I check my 6p and BAM! Got that GA😀 Satyapriya Satyarthi Finally got it on my moto G4 play (India). ACF05 Got it! Samsung galaxy s6 edge, Italy, english US. If you do not receive yet try to cancel the cache of play services.

Noticed it last night, 3/7 David Marín One question, if I live in Spain but I have the mobile in English, will I have Google Assistant at the same time as in America or will I have to wait? Bala kumar As I understand from other users, the location doesn't matter as far the Device and Google app language is set to English US. But Google only knows WHEN you will actually get the Google Assistant. David Marín Thanks! Few minutes after read your comment I tried to launch Google Assistant and it's here! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/748fea8f3e1369f434811749515ae82e104539d69504577854e7566a5c6c4ce1.png Bala kumar But still I didn't received it 😪😥 nasso Me neither Nexus 5X spain David Marín I replied you in you're other comment ;) David Marín Do you want the apks?

And i have the same Google APK David Marín Hmmm... I am running 32 bits software (the hardware support 64 but the software runs 32 bits), so I don't think so yet... nasso I only can wait i think but what happen first, the Play services update or assistant appears? David Marín Try to do this: https://youtu.be/gt9MTBWrTlg. After start, download TouchVPN to fake that you live in India. Good luck! wlkn Just arrived on my HTC 10 this morning. I just realized how much I use Google now :( Urmil Shroff #APKPLZ AbheySaini Got it in India! HD Where's Android Wear 2.0? Doby Gillis Who cares? Has nothing to do with this anyway. Daniel Krause AW 2.0 uses Assistant ;) Carlos David Got it on Ecuador! Yesterday updated to March security patch, maybe related. Cleared cache before rooted the phone, maybe clearing cache related too. Jeesan I got the assistant after uninstalling the updates from play services (after deactivation) and updating to current level. I am in India and using Nexus 5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2bde0c886bdfbbde24709c418416c172f4921894531ae62ec1a4e0379b45e804.png Richard Mircea Thanks for the tip. Just got it myself this way. Jeesan Uninstall play services to factory level and update to current level again to get the assistant. In India, Nexus 5 EcE Did not work for me. Bala kumar What is your play services version? Bala kumar I believe it is being activated by Play Services version 10.2.99 & above. But manual installation via APK won't work. We need to get the update via play store. Above are just assumptions . Daniel Tiberius Automatically got it on my T-Mobile v20. Neato! BlackHawkRider . Finally got the google assistant on my phone. There was no notice regarding it. I just happened to press the home button to scan a text message and assistant popped out! Anyone else got the assistant yet? Austin Eschweiler My T-Mobile 6P got it last night, wasn't any update that I saw so it must have been server side. Matt I got Google Assistant in the UK after installing Play Services Beta and setting all language settings to US English. Restarting my phone a couple times and then leaving it alone for a little while. But I changed the language back to UK English and after about 30mins, it reverted back while I was using it! So if you get it and want to keep it don't revert back to your language (or UK at least) just yet. nasso How do you install Play services beta? I've joined to the beta a day ago and no updates yet Bala kumar You didn't got an update in Play Store since GOOGLE didn't flipped the switch yet for you... As I said in other comment, only GOOGLE knows WHEN you will get it... ACF05 Try to update the play services from apkmirror and to delete the cache of it. nasso What is the version i have to dowload? I've cleared the cache and rebooted at least 3 times ACF05 The last version, look in the menu of application of your device what version you have so you can see what apk you must install nasso Thanks a loot!! I've Google assistant!!!! Amaziiing ACF05 Great! 😀 ghostdroid1 Finally got it on my S7 edge yesterday! Scarlett is there a way to take off the google assistant to where if you long press the home button it sends you to google now? douglas gomes Hello. I can not activate Google assistant. I would like to know who has the Google app Beta and which version is it? Beatle Bailey So let me see if I've got this right according to reports... People got Nexus devices ostensibly to be first in getting all things new in Android. Of those people, many also enroll in beta programs to be at the forefront of innovation. It looks like those people are mostly still in the dark waiting for Assistant (including me) while Joe Shmoes everywhere are getting it on Motorola, Samsung, etc. devices. 🖕 Google. Blake Yep. How the Nexuses weren't first is kinda mind boggling. Still nothing on my 6P. Anel I got it yesterday, but after 1 hour it disappeared, now i can't activate again, it just doesn't show up? Any idea why Beatle Bailey Is your phone rooted by chance? Anel No, stock andorid 7.1.1 nexus 5x Anel No its not im stock Bala kumar Did you change the Phone language or Search Language? Anel I didnt touch nothing, its weird isn't it? Anel No i didn't change anything,, strange geeq i just hate google for the fragmentation of android, now GA, still no waze for android auto... i wish there would be a decent win10 phone with "auto" features, waze, all the google apps like maps, streetview, gmail, etc... ×XWreckTeamX× I know at least 10 people that have it and I checked one of their phones to see if it was a different version on the google app but it was the same as mine Beatle Bailey I'm curious, are you're rooted? I'm starting to wonder if being rooted disqualifies devices for Google Assistant. Like how Android Pay doesn't work on rooted phones. ×XWreckTeamX× No I'm not at&t 7.0 S7 edge Henboy10 I wonder if my Nexus 7 running Android M will get it Ernie Still nothing on my Nexus 6p!!!! Blake Same...It's getting ridiculous. Rob Haven't got it yet :( Marty Some other sites have related Google Assitant to a Google Play Services update, but I don't believe it is. I have GA on my N5X with GPS version 10.2.98. I extracted that GPS as an APK and installed it on another device but GA isn't working on the other device. Ernie Update: Just got it after I got the new Google app beta!!! Marty So far it's working on one of my phones that I moved the Google app to System before installing the Google beta app. I guess it's hit and miss, though, because I did this to another phone and GA isn't working on it. Bala kumar Finalllllyyyyyyyy I got the GA. Just minutes back got an update for Google App beta. May be coincidence...? I didn't clear any app cache, didn't restart the phone... Nothing... Just pop up when I did a screen search.☺️💐 I can say "Google just flipped the switch ON for my device" TannoV I'm an English user in the Netherlands, and it's available to me. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bcd9c327d79f009bcd9e1807db260db7a8366e766e2a7439b526f6ec28e46826.png David Marín For all the people who don't have Google Assistant yet, try to do this: https://youtu.be/gt9MTBWrTlg. After start, download TouchVPN to fake that you live in India. Good luck to all you! Ktoś It's a bit annoying that you can't select a desired local only for google assistant... (I'm Polish, I have all my devices in Spanish for learning purposes and have google search set to use English(primary), Spanish and English) and… I got the assistant when I switched UI to English US (which has another awful feature of using am/pm ;) ) but after playing for a while I've reverted back... because google now seems more usefull… sergey a Yeah. Got it as well here in Russia. But sure what to do with it though. It is weird to speak with the phone IMHO. 😂 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c2964c7d5f2b70be724555503e8d93d1e0fad5c54c973a3d3b308dc0ce1df9b6.png cinval It just turned up on my 5X here in Norway :) cinval Just got it on my Honor 8 in Norway 🇳🇴 but it hasn't arrived yet on my 6P.. Mohammed G. Mansi Finally got it! Nexus 6 7.1.1, signed up for the google app and google play services beta, updated them, cleared data for both apps, restarted the phone, tried, nothing, google app setting, voice, set up google assistant, tried again, vualla :D Gabriele Di Bernardo How did you get 7.1.1 on the Nexus 6? I have been waiting and waiting but currently I have 7.0 Mohammed G. Mansi I flashed the ota manually.. I always do that instead of waiting months for the update to arrive on my phone, it's easy and doesn't reset my phone, so why not? :) Mohammed G. Mansi Guys I just tried it on my wife's phone,I just cleared google app data (all data not just the cache) tried and it worked! She has a Samsung Note 5 6.0.1 Paul Schmidt Just noticed that Google Now had automatically upgraded to Assistant on my LG G3 on Verizon. I am on Play Services 10.2.98 Blake Lol I STILL don't have it on my 6P. Kinda don't care at this point though. But it's weird. Yakuzah Love to know where this feature is, because I still don;t have it enable on my Nexus 6p Gabriele Di Bernardo Press and hold home button ('O' Button) and Google Assistant will open. Was issued with their latest update. I have it on my Nexus 6 with android version 7.0 which I understand will be upgraded to 7.1.1 Harshal Soni I join the beat update of Google app and Google Play services but still I am not able to get the assistant on the launch it just go to the normal search Bar of the Google.

(Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo) I/O, Google’s huge developer conference/outdoor coding festival will be wrapping up in Mountain View tomorrow. Thousands of developers have been soaking in the sun and knowledge while Google woos them with free Google Homes, raw vegan salads, and a live performance by LCD Soundsystem. Usually the can’t miss moment of the conference is the Day 1 Keynote, when Google announces big changes to Android, Daydream, and other software and services. Yet this year, Android’s biggest news was announced four days before the conference. So let’s talk about Project Treble, Google’s plan to get Android updates to users faster. Advertisement Deciphering Google’s blog post on the subject feels like it requires a degree in Computer Science, but in short, it appears Google is changing how the core framework of Android works so that it can push big future updates, like the next iteration of Android, Android O, to phones without waiting on phone carriers or phone designers to do it. This is potentially great for consumers. Most of us have grown bored with Android updates precisely because it’s unknown when or even if our phones will get those updates. Android currently boasts two billion monthly active devices, but according to its own numbers only 7.1-percent of those devices have the latest Android OS (Nougat) installed. Even relatively new phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7 were slow to get Nougat, with the roll out starting in earnest just last month, seven months after Nougat launched. That means many S7s still can’t run apps side by side, control notifications, or take advantage of the 72 emojis Nougat added. Everything New About Android From Google I/O Today at the annual Google I/O developer conference, we learned about all the updates coming to the …Read more “It would be a massive game changer,” mobile developer Brandon John-Freso told me after he and his friends Googled the poorly publicized project. “That’s super huge.” Indeed, Project Treble, and what it could mean, might be so good that it’s kind of alarming it wasn’t discussed more during the Day 1 keynote. (Google even told us it didn’t have any people on the ground at I/O who were briefed to talk about it.) Advertisement “I was quite surprised,” attendee Glenn Gruber, an analyst with Lopez Research, told Gizmodo. “After how huge Project Treble was, I was sure we’d get bigger news during I/O.” Only, as Gruber noted, that didn’t happen. Instead we got Photos and a “smarter” Google Assistant. Which is crazy! Project Treble has the potential to fix one of devs, and consumers, biggest complaints: Fragmentation. Instead of feigning excitement about many of the relatively minor updates Google choose to focus on, us regular people could have been excited about the new iOS-like version of the Android ecosystem. Advertisement Sponsored Consider that according to Apple, seventy-nine percent of iOS devices are on the latest version, iOS 10. Developers know they can take advantage of the coolest iOS features because the majority of users will be have access to those features. Like when Swiftkey and other third party keyboard apps launched alongside iOS 8, the iOS version that allowed for third party keyboards. Third party keyboard makers could immediately take advantage of the iOS 8 feature because they knew that had a guaranteed enormous audience. That simply wouldn’t be possible today with Google. Yet when Project Treble goes live with Android O later this year that will be possible. iOS’s biggest competitor is closing a major gap between them. Too bad no one at Google I/O knew about it.

This could mean that Google will eventually allow users to theme their software with a set of colors, icons, and wallpapers that are made to make Android more personal. The first “theme” that’s appeared is the “Pixel Theme” which includes User Icons 1-8, System Error, Primary, Secondary, tertiary, Quaternary, and Accent colors. Why would Google want to allow Themes in their most basic version of Android, for the world to use? It’s not as if Google couldn’t do it before – Sony’s “RRO” theming system seems very much to be the basis for Google’s newest in theming code. Google’s been using “framework-res.apk” for a few generations – ROM-makers know that this is the place to go to make changes to the way Android looks. Sony smartphones use RRO files to deliver different sets of basic overlays for the main Android UI. Users can download different themes, and those themes change the way colors and icons look. It’s a very simple changing of a few elements that can’t possibly harm the more important components of the machine. The folks at XDA Developers have harvested the crop that are the RRO files included with the Android O beta. SEE IT, DO IT: Download the Android O Beta Users that have the Android O Beta loaded to their Nexus or Pixel devices can see “Device Theme” in the Display section of their Android Settings. At this time, only Android Auto Generated RRO and “Pixel” are able to be selected. It was all the way back in April of 2014 when Sony first contributed their own RRO (Runtime Resource Overlay) framework to Android, so Sony reminds us. It only took three years for Google to find the need to actually make use of RROs in their own code – if they end up keeping the system through past Beta, that is. Conjecture: Google’s Future I believe Google is making this move with themes (with RRO-level themes, that is) now because of their aims with Google Assistant. With Google Assistant and Fuchsia OS, Google eventually relieves itself of the need for Linux. Allowing users to pick their own theme for Android makes a TINY nudge away from the desire for 3rd-party homescreen replacement apps – and rooting – and everything that comes with it. If RRO Themes stick around for the final (first public non-Beta) release of Android O, it’ll be another Pixel-like move by Google. It’ll be another move toward an operating system that’s uniquely Google, and not necessarily open source and available for every manufacturer under the sun. In the long-term, that could mean that we wont have Android forever. In the short term, it probably means that Google will continue to push their “Be Together. Not the Same” campaign, but not necessarily so much about different smartphone hardware. Instead, Google’s future would push the possibilities in Android being different for every person, software-side. Inside the Google Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL, and Pixel 2 XXL, there’d be a smartphone for everyone – all from Google. Each of these devices would be very similar to one another on the outside, but inside, everyone would get the feeling they’ve got a whole different experience with their own theme. Over the past few years, smartphones have been converging on one basic design – this might be Google taking advantage of that smartphone singularity.

Scroll Staff Published Yesterday · 12:11 pm.   Google engineer Scott Huffman at the conference - Reuters Google on Wednesday said its Google Assistant will now be accessible on Apple Inc’s iPhone. The technology giant also announced several new features at its annual developer conference in Mountain View California. The artificial intelligence-driven, voice-controlled digital assistant, is aimed at giving competition to Apple’s Siri feature. Google officials also announced an upgraded Google Home speaker, a job search tool and a virtual reality headset. The company’s representatives said the assistant will soon be able to “complete transactions and supply information about objects captured by the smartphones camera”. Observers, however, said the company’s Android operating system was sidelined during the conference, Reuters reported. The company’s product rivals Microsoft, Apple and Amazon’s offerings to provide a voice-powered digital assistant. “Humans are interacting with computing in more natural and immersive ways,” Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai was quoted as saying. “We have been using voice as an input across many of our products.” The chief executive officer also said that its main revenue generator, its search engine, would be upgraded with a jobs tab that would filter suggestions based on remuneration and commute time. Users will be able to use Google Home to make phone calls and also access HBO Now streaming service. We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

In the car with Android in the Car Posted 9 hours ago by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Kickstarter launches tools for creators, because hardware is hard One of the areas that Google talked up regarding Android beyond phones at I/O this year was in vehicles, and Android in the Car was the main way it’s expanding its in-car presence. The expansion of its Android Auto software offers deeper integration with vehicle infotainment and climate control systems, and putting Assistant front and center for more voice control inside the car and out. The system offers Google Maps navigation, of course, as demoed in a Volvo V90 outfitted with Android in the Car specifically for demonstration purposes. But it also offers easy access to your cabin AC and heat, and you can ask the Volvo to simply cool things down or heat them up to turn the air on or off. The Android-based OS also can control windows, the sunroof and more. You can also use Assistant-compatible smart home devices from the comfort of your car’s cockpit via voice commands. Our guide for the experience, Google Senior Product Manager Haris Ramic, showed us how this works using Hue light bulbs and a Nest learning thermostat, mounted for demo purposes on a wood backdrop meant to simulate your house. Android in the Car Android in the Car Android in the Car Android in the Car Android in the Car  View Slideshow Previous Next Exit Basically, Android in the Car means that you can take a lot of your mobile experience with you, and now that Assistant is getting improved cross-device features and Google’s really pushing it with developers, this should be very good news for consumers. We still have to wait a while for this to arrive in cars you can actually buy: Volvo says that it’ll be debuting on new cars sometime within two years, but it isn’t getting more specific than that. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Android Description Android is a software platform for mobile devices based on the Linux operating system and developed by Google and the Open Handset Website http://code.google.com/android Full profile for Android Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Symphony Messaging App Joins the Unicorn Club | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Android Google software engineering computing Automotive Popular Posts Featured Stories Immotor's high-tech scooter can also charge your laptop VIDEO | 1:15 Facebook Messenger debuts a new look focused on improving navigation 16 hours ago | Sarah Perez Uber Freight launches to connect truck drivers with available shipments 17 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Patreon doubles in a year to 1M paying patrons and 50K creators 23 hours ago | Josh Constine And the winner of Startup Battlefield at Disrupt NY 2017 is… RecordGram yesterday | Romain Dillet Latest From Mobile Twitter hires a new GM of revenue products 9 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Google’s AMP now powers 2B+ mobile pages and 900K domains, loads 2x faster 11 hours ago | Ingrid Lunden Facebook, Messenger and Instagram unite with cross-app notifications 12 hours ago | Josh Constine Android Pay to expand to new markets, add improved loyalty card features 12 hours ago | Sarah Perez Comment moderation powered by Up Next Kickstarter launches tools for creators, because hardware is hard Posted 9 hours ago CrunchBoard Job Listings Data Analyst: Real Estate @ Mynd at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Senior Software Engineer @ Grove at The Sourcery (San Francisco, CA, United States) Full Stack Developer at KQED (San Francisco, CA, United States) Marketing director at Altpoint Ventures at Altpoint Ventures (Greenwich, CT, United States) Lead Full-Stack Engineer at CodePath (San Francisco, CA, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip Activations Blog International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

Hide Caption 18 of 18 Story highlights A new study ties skyrocketing HIV testing kit sales to actor Charlie Sheen "Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do," one expert says (CNN)When celebrities speak, it seems, the world listens -- even when it comes to personal and public health. Just look at what happened after Charlie Sheen's HIV disclosure two years ago, said John Ayers, a research professor at San Diego State University. Sales of in-home HIV testing kits reached record highs around the same time the actor announced that he had been diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2015, according to a study published in the journal Prevention Science on Thursday. Ayers was a co-author of the study. About the same time, "in record numbers, people were going online, seeking out information on what the signs of HIV are, on how to find and appropriately prevent HIV with devices such as condoms and also how to get tested,'" Ayers said. "We've seen this ... many times over." The 'Charlie Sheen effect' really did help HIV awareness For the new study, Ayers and his co-authors monitored weekly sales of OraQuick, the only FDA-approved at-home oral HIV testing kit available in the United States, from 2014 to 2016. Read More The researchers found that there were 8,225 more sales than they expected the week of Sheen's HIV status announcement. Elevated sales continued for four weeks after Sheen's disclosure. The findings show a correlation, not a direct causation. Yet in a previous study, Ayers and his colleagues also found that Google searches for HIV testing and related topics also spiked after Sheen's announcement. "The most common reaction is, 'So what? What does a search really mean?' Our new study shows not only did Sheen's disclosure lead people to seek information about HIV prevention, it also corresponded with record levels of at-home rapid HIV testing sales," Ayers said. Though they are not doctors, many celebrities have had both positive and negative ties to public health in recent years. When celebrities open up about their health "The positive example I often point to is when Magic Johnson talked about being HIV-positive, which provided a moment to bust stigma around HIV," said Steven Hoffman, scientific director of the Institute of Population and Public Health in Canada and director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. In 1991, when most people didn't have much information about the virus and the Internet was not commonly used, the American basketball star announced that he had tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA. "Here was a very prominent athlete who is publicly disclosing being HIV-positive and opening up conversation around it for people," said Hoffman, who was not involved in the latest study. "I think that's an example highlighting the positive role that celebrity can play in informing health decisions." Yet while Johnson's HIV disclosure spurred questions and conversations, since the virus was still unfamiliar, Sheen's disclosure was linked to action, Ayers said. From Rock Hudson to Charlie Sheen, a history of celebrity HIV revelations After Sheen's announcement, about 1.25 million people in the United States searched online for topics directly related to condoms, HIV symptoms or HIV testing, according to Ayers' previous study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine last year. That study involved analyzing Google Trends and search term data from 2004 through November 2015, which included when Sheen disclosed his HIV status on November 17, 2015. The researchers found that Sheen's announcement corresponded with the greatest number of HIV-related Google searchers ever recorded in the US. But Sheen didn't make an immediate call to action for the public to get tested or use condoms, and public health groups didn't use him as a face to raise HIV awareness.

MUST WATCH Celebrities who changed the face of HIV 01:08 Therefore, Sheen's disclosure was an example of how -- without the celebrity or public health leaders calling for action -- the public appeared to still respond based on health information that was widely known, Ayers said. "When Magic Johnson made his disclosure, there wasn't a similar reaction. There couldn't be, because people didn't know what to do," Ayers said. "Remember, people (were) asking, 'Can he play basketball?' 'Can I shake his hand?' There wasn't this trove of information about HIV, HIV prevention and HIV testing. When Sheen disclosed, there was this trove of information," he said. "We saw people seeking out information on the signs of HIV, HIV testing and how to prevent HIV by using condoms. We saw this trilogy of reaction that is fairly consistent with what public health has been promoting for 20-plus years." JUST WATCHED The 'Angelina effect' on cancer Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The 'Angelina effect' on cancer 02:22 Kami Kosenko, an associate professor of health communication at North Carolina State University, said that she believes actress Angelina Jolie's 2013 announcement of a double mastectomy to prevent breast cancer also had a positive influence on public health, despite possibly influencing an uptick in unnecessary genetic testing. Jolie said she made her decision because she has a mutation in her BRCA1 gene. Specific inherited mutations in BRCA1 increase the risk of breast and ovarian cancers, and Jolie's mother died of ovarian cancer. Jolie decided to also have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in 2015. Kosenko led a study in which 229 women were surveyed immediately after Jolie's announcement to undergo a double mastectomy. Researchers looked at whether Jolie influenced the women's genetic testing intentions. JUST WATCHED Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Jolie's op-ed prompts women's health discussion 06:07 The study, published in the Journal of Health Communication last year, showed that 30% of the women intended to get tested to see whether they carried the BRCA1 gene, 23% said they would probably get tested, and 7% said they would definitely get tested. The others reported that they would not get tested. Kosenko said that separate studies demonstrated increased genetic testing requests and Internet searches related to BRCA1 after Jolie's announcement. "We rely heavily on friends and family for health information, and we tend to see certain celebrities as friends. Unfortunately, we do not share the same resources as these famous 'friends,' which impacts our ability to follow celebrity health advice," she said. "For example, at the time of Jolie's announcement, the genetic tests she underwent were prohibitively expensive for the average American." There are examples of celebrities having a potentially harmful influence on public health too, said Hoffman, director of the University of Ottawa's Global Strategy Lab. 'I do blame celebrities' "The most prominent example of harm would be, in my mind, Jenny McCarthy," Hoffman said. The American actress has been a vocal autism activist, spreading concerns that autism might be associated with childhood vaccines. McCarthy was unavailable for comment, but her representative said she addressed her stance on vaccines in an op-ed published in the Chicago Sun-Times in 2014, headlined "The gray area on vaccines." Her son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism. She believes that doctors should change some children's vaccine schedules, such as allowing for one shot per doctor's visit instead of multiple shots, she wrote in the op-ed. "I am not 'anti-vaccine.' This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted. For years, I have repeatedly stated that I am, in fact, 'pro-vaccine' and for years I have been wrongly branded as 'anti-vaccine,' " McCarthy wrote. "My beautiful son, Evan, inspired this mother to question the 'one size fits all' philosophy of the recommended vaccine schedule," she wrote. "I embarked on this quest not only for myself and my family, but for countless parents who shared my desire for knowledge that could lead to options and alternate schedules, but never to eliminate the vaccines." JUST WATCHED McCarthy's controversial vaccine 'View' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH McCarthy's controversial vaccine 'View' 03:14 Research shows that side effects from vaccines are rare, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has repeatedly stated that there is no link between vaccines and autism. "She is actually recommending practices that are unhealthful and potentially dangerous," Hoffman said about McCarthy's stance on changing vaccine schedules. "Recommending to people not to vaccinate their children means not only are the children being subjected to unnecessary harm, but many others around those children who might not be able to get vaccinated for legitimate reasons are put at an additional risk ask well," he said. "It's not only unfair to the children who aren't being vaccinated, but also to the many people who can't be vaccinated, who interact with those children." Even though they are vulnerable to illness, some people may not be able to get certain vaccines based on age, an allergy or pre-existing health condition, or other factors, according to the CDC. Public health experts also have accused actress Gwyneth Paltrow of spreading some questionable health tips through her lifestyle blog, goop. In a written statement, goop spokeswoman Noora Raj Brown described the website as pushing "new ideas into the conversation" in health and wellness. "We have a disclaimer on the bottom of every article that states the purpose is to highlight alternative studies and induce conversation. It's not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. The views of the experts profiled don't necessarily represent the views of goop," the statement said. Sorry, Gwyneth: Experts advise against jade egg to strengthen pelvic muscles One blog post on goop recommended inserting a rock, called a jade egg, into your vagina to improve your sex life and orgasms, among other benefits. Some experts have said that not thoroughly cleaning or sterilizing the jade egg could lead to infection, or that it could get stuck. "In many cases, there are opposing opinions on issues -- like the jade eggs for example -- and our role is to service the conversation," Brown said. A list of spas and wellness centers on goop mentions "v-steam," or vaginal steaming, and suggests that the practice "balances female hormone levels," which some experts have refuted. "Gwyneth Paltrow's messages, it's mostly that she's recommending practices that don't work," Hoffman said. "The biggest harm is the loss or waste of money and the misplaced attention away from practices that actually work." A jade egg on goop costs about $66. Hoffman said that the money could be better spent on buying nutritious foods or a gym membership. "Do celebrities have an impact on health outcomes? We know they do. ... There's so many studies out there that have demonstrated that when celebrities either give helpful or harmful advice to people, it's routinely followed," Hoffman said. "I do blame celebrities, because they need to recognize the impact they can have and the potential harm that can result from it," he said. "I definitely blame those who are spreading misinformation." How celebrities have hacked public health talks Hoffman and his colleagues published a review paper in the British Medical Journal to analyze the influence celebrities have on people's health decisions through the factors of economics, marketing, psychology and sociology. "In marketing literature, they talk about a halo effect around celebrities, whereby people have a very positive view of celebrities, and when celebrities endorse a product or recommend a particular health practice, it transfers their golden glow from the celebrity to the products or practice," Hoffman said. "In economics literature, there's recognition of something called signaling, which is whereby in a marketplace filled with competing ideas, people are constantly looking for a shortcut in order to identify which products or practices they should be following, and so a celebrity endorsing a product provides a cognitive shortcut to an otherwise very complicated decision," he said. "There is increasing recognition of the role of social networks, and there's few people who have bigger social networks than celebrities. Just think of the number of Twitter followers some celebrities have cultivated." Mental wellness warriors: Fighting for those who need it most However, Ayers, author of the latest study, said it might not be that complicated. "It's not so much about a celebrity effect," he said, adding that when celebrities speak out about health-related issues, it may resonate because they are speaking as humans with just as much vulnerability to health impacts as anyone else. "Typically, public health uses top-down strategies. The most effective messages are believed to come from the experts, 'from the top.' The people who know the most about the subject, the people who are paid to sit around and think about the subject," Ayers said. "It turns out, though, that if you look at the Sheen effect and if you look at these other examples of organic media events ... that's not the case. These messages, they come from the bottom; they come from ordinary people. People who aren't health experts. Sheen might be a celebrity, but he's not a health expert. Angelina Jolie is not a health expert," he said. All in all, Hoffman said, public health officials could work with celebrities to harness their fame to spread evidence-based health information and mitigate the spread of misinformation. He cited supermodel Christy Turlington Burns as a positive example of a celebrity working with public health authorities to promote positive health practices. She served as a spokeswoman in CDC promotional ads raising awareness about smoking cessation and the health risks of smoking. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. Ayers said he saw public health officials utilize the power of Sheen's celebrity in real time, not during but after his HIV announcement. "It turns out that actually because of our study, we got to see those things happen. When we published our study, a few weeks later, Charlie Sheen began speaking out about HIV prevention, particularly condoms, and he cited our study as one of the reasons for doing that," Ayers said of the study on Google searches. "We also saw several leading organizations in HIV prevention begin to use Charlie Sheen's disclosure as a way to promote HIV prevention." Hoffman said it would be beneficial to see more examples of celebrities and public health leaders working together in the future. "I think there probably are a lot of celebrities who want to do good and would be open to the idea of working with public health officials to do good," he said. "We just need to still figure out the best way of doing that, in terms of what would be most effective." For now, to make informed health decisions, Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, offered some guidance in an email. "Get a second opinion," he wrote. "Trust but verify celebrity statements from trusted health sources like the American Cancer Society, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, APHA, American Academy of Pediatrics" and others.

Name: Subject: Message: New Android payment features will include sending money via Google Assistant Newsby John Callaham8 hours ago 110 4 More and more financial transactions are being handled via smartphones. Google knows this, and wants to offer even more ways to make those payments easier on phones. As part of the 2017 Google I/O developer conference this week, it revealed plans to add more payment options and features for Android device owners. See also: Android Pay vs Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay Overview April 27, 2016 Google has already announced that Android device user can now make online payments with any card that is saved in their Google account. In a blog post today, the company also confirmed that it will soon add a way to send anyone money via voice commands from Google Assistant. When you have your card linked to your Google account, you will soon be able to say something like, “Ok Google, send $20 to John”, with Google Assistant on your phone, or via the Google Home connected speaker. The money will then be sent over to that person. Google is also launching the Card Linked Offers API for developers so they can send targeted special offers for loyalty card users on Android Pay.  Speaking of which, it will be launching in the near future in more countries, including Brazil, Canada, Russia, Spain and Taiwan. Google is also working with PayPal to offer its users a more “streamlined” mobile payment experience on Android. Finally, Google says it is working with a company called Clover to integrate Google’s smart tap payment features in Clover’s developer APIs. That means app developers will be able to include Android Pay features more directly, including adding support for loyalty, coupon and gift card redemption,along with a way for app users to order ahead and tap for pick up.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 92 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares267 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see.

The new devices won't require a phone or PC and will be made available to consumers later this year. But VR is a crowded space and Google will have to compete with Oculus, Intel, Samsung and others. According to IDC, global shipments of VR and AR headsets will increase from 10 million units in 2016 to nearly 100 million in 2021. Google's vice president of virtual and augmented reality Clay Bavor says the key technology here is the use of sensors, instead of external cameras or trackers, that makes the experience more realistic. These sensors pinpoint your location in the virtual environment using specific features, like bright dots or sharp corners, "which makes the view in the virtual world perfectly correspond with your motion in the real world, and it makes for a far higher sense of realism," Bavor explained. "Unless your view in the virtual world exactly corresponds exactly to how you're moving in the real world, when you see and feel different things it can be a little uncomfortable."

At a developer session at Google's I/O developer conference called "What's New With Daydream," some of the stats were revealed. The main takeaways: Google VR users spend more, are looking for more experiences, and don't spend as much time in their headsets as you probably think. According to Google's Brahim Elbouchikhi and Darren Delaye, the average Daydream user spends 40 minutes a week in VR. That doesn't seem like a lot: that's 5.7 minutes a day. Of that, nearly half is spent in video, like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu or other apps. Which means, if you're making a non-video app or game, you're trying to grab 20 minutes out of a Daydream VR user's week. There's good news, though: apparently, Daydream VR users are three times more likely to buy something, and spend up to 32 percent more than other Android users. That could also be related to Daydream View owners being more premium phone buyers with more disposable income, of course. Google's advice, at the session I attended at least, was to make more apps that are longer and meatier, and more interesting. Google acknowledges that it needs an Angry Birds of VR, or really any killer app. Upcoming standalone VR headsets are designed to be more "friction free," meaning possibly more time spent in the headsets... and more time in VR. And, Google's Daydream 2.0 software update will focus on spending more time in the headset being social and checking messages, with less need to take the headset off periodically. Whether that turns into more VR hours a week remains to be seen: even getting to a full hour would be an achievement.

That may be true on Google's own devices, like the Pixel smartphone, but the Assistant is hobbled on the iPhone.  Google Assistant on the iPhone, left, and Apple's Siri. During the keynote at the Google I/O conference this week, the internet giant unveiled a version of its Assistant as an app for the iPhone. It has a slick design, integrates the company's ubiquitous search engine, and taps into Google services like Gmail and Google Calendar. The crowd of developers in the audience cheered: millions of new iPhone users to reach for innovative voice-based interactions.  But the reality for iPhone users is that the Google Assistant will probably never beat Apple Inc.'s Siri on its home turf. That's bad news for the Alphabet Inc. unit, which wants its voice-based technology everywhere. Here are some of the limitations:  You have to download it from the App Store. While Siri is fully baked into the iPhone from the first time you turn it on, the only way to get Google Assistant on your iPhone is to download it from Apple's App Store. This may seem obvious as it is a third-party program, but the process of finding the app, installing it, and placing it in an ideal spot on your home screen is significant friction that will likely limit adoption and usage. On Google's Pixel phone, there are none of these potential road blocks.  You can't launch it with your iPhone's home button or with your voice. To launch Siri on your iPhone, you just click the home button for a couple of seconds. You can also say "Hey, Siri" if you have more recent hardware. With the Google Assistant app, you have to either use a shortcut in the widget panel left of the iPhone's first home screen or find the app icon. You also can't launch the app by saying "OK, Google," but you can use the phrase if you already have the app open. This relatively small inconvenience can be a deal breaker as one of the selling points of a comprehensive voice assistant is to avoid tapping and switching between different apps. You can't tap into basic iPhone functions and settings. Siri is one of the quickest ways to turn on Airplane Mode, or Do Not Disturb, or create alarms. Google Assistant on the iPhone can't integrate deeply enough into Apple's iOS operating system to pull off those actions. It does let you input calendar appointments, set timers, jot down shopping lists, look up contacts, and get reminders, but all of that functionality works only with Google's own services. If you're in the iCloud ecosystem -- using built-in core mobile features like Apple's calendar or contacts -- you'll probably stick with Siri.  You can't launch apps, search some Apple content stores, or pull up photos. One of the most handy Siri features is the ability to search for App Store apps, iTunes movies, and photo albums with your voice. Google Assistant can't tap into those features, although you can search for Apple Music songs and it will send you to that app. Similarly, you can't ask Google to launch Apple apps on your iPhone, like the calculator or a sports news app, but you can launch many Google-made apps that are installed on the iPhone. You can't integrate with other non-Google apps on your iPhone. Siri sends you seamlessly into Uber or Lyft apps to order a ride, send a text message via WhatsApp, or post to Twitter. With Google Assistant on the iPhone, the extent of most app integration ends at Google services like YouTube and Gmail. (Google says Apple Music is again an exception). Google has chat bots (called Actions on Google) for various news, productivity and travel services, but there are limitations since the system is not tapping into actual apps on the iPhone. Google says deeper third-party app integration is coming.  Integrated Apple services typically require an extra step. While many Apple apps and services don't play nicely with Google Assistant, some do work. Namely, text messaging, and making phone calls. However, texts and calls require an extra step. Asking Siri to send a message, or call a colleague puts Apple's assistant to work instantly. Google's Assistant requires tapping an extra button to confirm those actions.  You can't easily use it in the car. Siri is deeply integrated into your car's Bluetooth system. Users can either hold down the iPhone home button, hit an assigned key on a steering wheel, or say the Siri voice command. Google Assistant on iPhones doesn't have this level of integration, making it a non-starter in the car.  Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Altogether, unless you are deeply in the Google ecosystem, using Google Assistant on the iPhone is a pain compared to Siri. Of course, over time, it is possible that Apple will open up more functionality to the Google Assistant. For now, however, Google Assistant on the iPhone does have one or two advantages over Siri, even for those in the Apple apps and services world. You can type into the Assistant. This is great for situations where you want to quickly get a task done without speaking out loud. And if you have a Google Home speaker, the Assistant on the iPhone integrates well with that device for controlling other connected home gadgets.  For more on voice assistants, check out our Decrypted  podcast:   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

The 114-year-old automaker said yesterday it is cutting 1,400 non-factory jobs in North America and Asia Pacific. The company will offer voluntary early retirement and separation packages to about 10 percent of its salaried workers in departments such as sales, marketing and human resources. It expects the actions to be complete by the end of September. The cuts are the biggest to Ford’s U.S. white collar staff since 2007, when 7,200 workers took voluntary buyout packages. Google rolling out arsenal of services, gadgets Google has provided a look at its latest digital offerings, with a heavy focus on its efforts to extend artificial intelligence features into more of its apps and services. CEO Sundar Pichai unveiled Google Lens, a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you are looking at. It will first be available as part of Google’s voice-controlled digital assistant — which bears the straightforward name “Google Assistant” — and Photos app. In the real world, that means you could, for instance, point your phone camera at a restaurant and get reviews for it. Another tool in Google Photos will prompt you to share photos you take with people you know. The company is also giving the crowd a look at new twists in its Android software for mobile devices. The next version of Android, available to the mass market later this year, aims to gauge and control how much battery life your apps are using.

ATAP goes AWOL at Google I/O Posted 9 hours ago by Frederic Lardinois (@fredericl) 0 SHARES Next Story Twitter hires a new GM of revenue products For the last few years, Google’s skunkworks ATAP unit always held its own keynote at I/O, Google’s flagship developer conference. Often, this was where Google would show off its most experimental and interesting projects — and sometimes, this ATAP keynote was actually more fun than the larger, flashier I/O keynotes. This year, however, ATAP is nowhere to be found on the I/O schedule. According to a report from Business Insider earlier this week, the ATAP team’s mission changed after its former lead Regina Dugan decamped to Facebook, where she held court at that company’s F8 conference only a few weeks ago. That probably explains its absence at I/O, too. Unlike X, Google’s far more secretive “moonshot” division, ATAP always used I/O to show off its latest prototypes, whether those were miniaturized radar sensors for gesture detection, jackets with embedded sensors (which Levi’s has now turned into a product), Project Ara (the modularized smart phone that was eventually cancelled) or a new system for authenticating users without passwords. Some of those failed — sometimes spectacularly — but because the team saw itself as a “band of pirates,” that kind of failure was perfectly acceptable (even expected) — and because ATAP only worked on short-term projects, that wasn’t really an issue anyway. Today’s ATAP, under its new leader Rick Osterloh, however, doesn’t seem to be quite as freewheeling as its earlier incarnation. It’s also more secretive, less experimental and more focused on working on products that can be monetized faster. That’s obviously better for Google’s bottom line — and today’s Google is clearly more focused on that than it was only a few years ago. But while we may not see an ATAP keynote at I/O anytime soon, chances are we will now see a version of this at Facebook’s F8 instead. That is Google’s loss. Shortly after we published this story, Google responded. “It’s business as usual for ATAP,” a spokesperson told us. “About a year ago, they became part of the hardware team under Rick Osterloh, where their aim is to bring products and technology into Google’s hardware products, which we may bring to market or integrate into our portfolio, or use elsewhere within Google.” We asked Google for more information about ATAP’s absence but have not received a response yet. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Rick Osterloh Bio Rick Osterloh currently leads Google's hardware division.

How can the exterior of a building tell you anything about the food served inside, and why in God's name didn't we do some research before heading out? Luckily, Google feels my pain, which is why they've developed new technology called Google Lens, which lets you point your phone camera at anything and automatically Google it. So the next time you want to check a restaurant's menu and rating before blindly submitting your taste buds to whatever lies within, you can just use Google Lens to pull up the info for you. Think how many meals will be saved by this technology! No longer will we fall prey to the allure of a fancy-looking restaurant that serves weak $15 cocktails when we could instead be downing ice-cold brews at the humble yet highly rated joint next door.

Snow reported at Afriski, Tiffindell & Sani Pass Industry News / Advertising and Media / Online media / Android O is killing Google’s blob emoji (and replacing that adorable kitty) By Andy Walker: Editor on 18 May, 2017 AndyWalkerSA Share Google might’ve announced a slew of updates to its products yesterday, but its most important development was mostly swept under the rug. The company’s derpy emoji, which featured anthropomorphous blobs wearing emotionless faces, will finally be replaced by more expressive figures. This is all part of Android O’s — Google’s upcoming mobile operating system — support of Emoji 5.0, part of Unicode 10.0. According to Emojipedia, there are also a number of new emoji heading to the OS, including a mage, a face that’s enjoying a good vomit, and of course a face with a hand over its mouth. If those aren’t to your liking, expect a giraffe, a pretzel and a dumpling too, a graphic mind-blown face, and a censorship emoji too. That’s not all either. Google’s new EmojiCompat library Google’s boffins have also sought a solution to the annoying emoji display issues, prominently seen when your phone doesn’t support the emoji you just received. Instead of showing a triangle with a cross, Android O’s new “EmojiCompat” support library will ensure that emoji are displayed even if your Android OS isn’t updated. More developer-friendly information can be found here. Not everyone is happy with Google’s new emoji though. ‘Don’t take my beautiful cat child away’ Whether in jest or serious concern, there’s currently a Change.org petition calling Google to “bring back the old cat emoji” which is set to also change from its current form. Like the blobs, the standard shading-less cat emoji will be outed by a higher-res, more detailed kitty. But the author of the petition doesn’t want a prettier cat. “Her beautiful smile was a shining light in these dark times we find ourselves in. I urge Google to reconsider this change because she is the one thing keeping this nation together today,” the petition reads. “Don’t take my beautiful cat child away.” The petition already has 90 supporters too. Twitter users also lamented the death of all the blobs, taking to Emojipedia’s account to voice their concerns. “Absolutely awful,” one tweeter expressed. @Emojipedia Absolutely awful. — Bar Shubayev (@bar_shubayev) May 17, 2017 @Emojipedia What was their justification for this? The gumdrop style emoji were the simplest, most distinct set out there. — Timothy Kempf (@takempf) May 17, 2017 Android O will likely hit devices in its consumer-ready version come Q3 or Q4 2017.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest 6 steps to creating a killer voice app for Alexa and Google Assistant Chen Levkovich, Conversation.one@chenlev May 18, 2017 2:10 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com / Zapp2Photo As you no doubt have experienced, a new market of conversational devices and services has emerged. From Amazon Alexa and Google Home to Facebook Messenger bot and intelligent assistants, we’re surrounded by conversation. (Between us, when was the last time you checked the weather on a device other than Alexa or Google Home?) While those devices and services are new and extremely dynamic, we can find a few success cases. Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple’s Siri are three worthwhile examples to learn from. Below are some important factors that made these devices so successful and how they can help you build your own killer conversational application. 1. Find the direct path to initial success Voice control bots and conversational UI services in general are actually not that new in our world. There were a few attempts in the past; even the old Nokia dumbphones had voice control features. However, most of these trials didn’t succeed. With zero patience, after one or two unsuccessful tries, users just moved on to their next thing or fell back to the web or mobile apps. So how do we find the direct path to success? Help your users ask the right questions. This sounds pretty obvious, but it is actually crucial to the success of your Alexa skill or Google Home action. I learned that when I initially set up my Amazon Echo device at home. The mobile app directed me to ask Alexa specific questions for which she had good answers, such as “Alexa, what is the time?” or “Alexa, what is the weather today?” I immediately received correct answers and therefore wasn’t discouraged by a default response of “Sorry, I don’t have an answer to that question.” 2. Think like a search engine, not a command line Conversational devices, command line interfaces, and search engines have much in common. In all three, you provide the machine with a textual question and receive in return a textual answer. But think about the user experience of command line versus search engine. Whereas a command line will produce an error message if you don’t use the exact correct format, search engines will always return a result, whether it’s the answer to your question or a suggestion for a different search. Here’s an example: To play music with Google Home, you could say, “OK Google, please play Taylor Swift station from Pandora.” In this case, Google will reach out to Pandora and search for Taylor Swift’s songs to play. But you can also use a shorter version for your request, such as, “Hey Google, please play Taylor Swift songs.” In the second version, Google will pick a music service and search for a Taylor Swift station there to play. If you just say “Hey Google, please play music,” Google will search for your enabled music service and play one of your favorite stations. Acting like a search engine provides you and the user with much more options, as there are answers for all different cases regardless of the format and data the user supplies. 3. Offer real value and functionality Finding your minimum viable product (MVP) is crucial for the success of any voice-control application, but beware of burning users by offering a limited product that does not provide value. Start with simpler types of features, such as content consumption. It can be listening to music or hearing the news, but also receiving information on your bank account balance, finding the price of an item, or even checking your next meeting on your CRM. Next, develop your secondary types of features that would let you create content or modify settings. This can be, for example, creating a new music station, transferring money between accounts, or adding a new meeting to your CRM. By providing a full-service application, you make sure your user sticks to your conversational application and doesn’t fall back to your web or mobile app. 4. Build an omnichannel service Remember, new devices are not replacing old devices — they are only adding to the big basket of channels you must support. What Amazon Alexa started was instantly followed by Google and now even Apple. Users today want to get your services anywhere and anytime. To do that, you must provide a similar level of services on all the different channels. For instance, you might see a spike in requests during the early morning and late night coming from home devices, such as Amazon Echo and Google Home. However, during the day, you will receive more activities from Facebook Messenger or your smartphone intelligent assistant. Similar questions must get similar answers on all devices, no matter how your user is consuming your services. 5. Stay up-to-date with trends Alexa, Google Home, and all the other voice-enabled devices are a new field in computing, and also extremely dynamic. As such, today’s top trends might grow huge, but they can also become obsolete and outdated in just a few months. This is why you must make sure that your applications stay up-to-date with users’ expectations. Some examples include supporting new types of enabled conversations, adding new functionalities, implementing relevant UI and UX, and of course supporting all the latest trendy devices. 6. Start now Gartner predicts that by 2018, 30 percent of our interactions with technology will be through conversations with smart machines. The digital voice-activated devices market is expected to double itself every year by 2020. To develop a voice-enabled application requires profound knowledge in machine learning, voice recognition, and natural language processing. In addition to that, developers must be extremely dynamic and flexible. If you want to make sure that you get a bite of this cake, you better start now. Learn the market, find the value you can provide using voice-controlled and conversational capabilities, and start building prototypes that will enable you to grow with the market.

Can Google make virtual reality less lonely? Posted on Thursday, May 18, 2017 by CNN in Business News Virtual reality can be lonely. For all of the overwrought promises about the futuristic technology connecting people, it’s a pretty isolating experience. The hardware shuts out any view or sound of people physically near you, not many people own headsets yet, and interactions inside virtual settings are still limited. Google is working on new features that could fix some of that. Unfortunately, it might involve hanging out in the VR version of a YouTube comments section. The company announced the next steps for its virtual and augmented reality technology on Thursday at its annual I/O developers conference in Mountain View, California. Google is releasing a major update to its virtual reality platform, Daydream. It’s the software that will run on its own Daydream View goggles as well as the standalone headsets that third parties like Lenovo are creating later this year. Google also makes the Daydream View, a low-tech VR headset that uses a smartphone. In the new version of Daydream, called Euphrates, you can broadcast what you see in virtual reality to a regular TV over a Chromecast. That way any friends or family members hanging out in your home can see what you see. The popularity of services like Twitch, which live streams other people playing video games, has shown there’s a demand for this type of sharing. If no one’s nearby, you can take a screenshot or record a video of what you see, like a level of a VR game. Post them on social media or share directly over text or email. If you’ve alienated all your local friends by making them watch you play video games, there’s a new option for hanging out with other VR users. YouTube is working on an update to its VR app that will let people watch the same videos together in virtual “shared rooms.” The feature will allow a limited number of people to view the same 360-degree videos simultaneously while speaking to each other over voice chat. You can also see what videos other people are watching and jump in. The rooms are public, so your customizable avatar is interacting with everyone else using the YouTube VR app. That makes it more like a spoken, virtual version of a YouTube comments section than a closed social app like Facebook’s Spaces. Google does plan to include safety features such as the ability to leave a group or block someone at anytime. Google is also bringing other staples of the old fashioned 2D internet into VR. It’s adding support for its Chrome web browser, so you can browse websites. All the new features are coming later this year.

Now that Android Wear is becoming a more mature platform, mostly thanks to the long-awaited 2.0 update, we're starting to see more watches than ever hit the market. It was fairly easy to compare Android Wear watches in years past - only a handful of tech companies even bothered. But now, a vast amount of wearables are being released, with most of them by actual watch companies. So how do they all stack up? You may notice some missing information below, especially from Fossil. We tried multiple times to reach out to Fossil for information on its upcoming watches, but we didn't receive a response. At a glance We've compiled a massive table comparing every watch. You can also look at it on Google Docs.

It's definitely one of the most feature-packed watches on the market, supporting every feature the OS does. It works with Wi-Fi, LTE, NFC, and GPS - and includes a heart rate sensor and a speaker. As far as specifications go, it has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, a 480x480 1.38" circular display, IP68 water resistance, and a 430mAh battery. Unfortunately, battery life isn't fantastic, especially if you need to use LTE often. Be sure to check out our full review for more details, and you can buy it now from various retailers for $349. LG Watch Style Just like the Watch Sport, this was developed by LG and Google as an Android Wear 2.0 launch device. The Style is much thinner than the Sport, but at the cost of features and battery life. It lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The battery capacity is just 240mAh, which should only get you through a day of use (if that). The Style has a Wear 2100 processor, a round 1.2" 360x360 display, and IP67 water resistance. You can find our full review here, and if you want to buy one for yourself, it will cost you $249. Casio Pro Trek WSD-F20 If you need a super rugged Android Wear device, the WSD-F20 may be for you. Casio announced the watch back in January, and it just recently went on sale for a whopping $500. For that price, you're getting a speaker, Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and a 1.32" 320x300 display. However, the WSD-F20 is missing quite a few important features. It doesn't have a heart rate sensor, NFC, or LTE. Also, it is one of the few 2017 Android Wear watches with a flat tire display. New Balance RunIQ New Balance released its first Android Wear watch earlier this year, the RunIQ. As you might guess, the RunIQ is primarily designed for workouts. It's powered by an Intel Atom Z34XX processor and includes Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, a 1.39" 400x400 circular display, a 410mAh battery, and 5ATM water resistance. Unfortunately, the RunIQ lacks NFC for Android Pay, as well as LTE connectivity and a speaker. It's currently priced at $299. Huawei Watch 2 Why, Huawei? You were the chosen one! After the original Huawei Watch ended up being one of the best Android Wear devices on the market, many were excited for a newer model. Unfortunately, what Huawei provided was subjectively worse than the original - you can find our full review here. If you're still interested, the Huawei Watch 2 has a 1.2" 390x390 circular display, a 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance, and all the connectivity and sensors you could want (including LTE). It's currently on sale for around $299, depending on the retailer. Huawei Watch 2 Classic The 'Classic' variant of the Huawei Watch 2 is probably closer to what most people were hoping for. It has almost exactly the same specifications as the normal Watch 2 - a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.2" 390x390 display, 420mAh battery, IP67 water resistance. However, it lacks the Wear 2's LTE support. The Watch 2 Classic is also $70 more expensive than the normal model, and shares many of its faults - small screen, no digital crown, etc. It's currently priced at $369 at most retailers. TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45 The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker. As far as connectivity and sensors, it has Wi-Fi, GPS, and NFC for Android Pay. It does not have a heart rate sensor or LTE. The Connected Modular 45 also wins the award for most expensive smartwatch on this list - you'll be shelling out $1,650 for the privilege of owning one. Montblanc Summit Similar to the TAG Huer, the Montblanc Summit is another luxury smartwatch. It has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU, 1.39" 400x400 circular display, heart rate sensor, 300mAh battery, and IP68 water resistance. Unfortunately, the Summit is a bit light on functionality. It doesn't have NFC, LTE, GPS, or a speaker. Whether or not that matters is up to you, but I expect the $890 starting price will drive most normal people away. GUESS Connect (2017) GUESS has made hybrid smartwatches with dot-matrix displays in the past, but this year, the company released a proper Android Wear watch. It's available in two sizes - a 41mm for women (left) and a 44mm for men (right). The GUESS Connect has a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor but lacks NFC, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch is expected to be released in Fall or Winter 2017 and will start at $300. Michael Kors Access Grayson/Sofie Michael Kors announced two very similar Android Wear watches earlier this year, the Access Grayson (left) and Access Sofie (right). The Grayson looks more like a traditional men's watch, with an AMOLED display and a digital crown. It will be available in gold, stainless steel, and blue/black. The Sofie is primarily targeted at women, with a thinner case and a lighter feel than the Grayson. It has the same AMOLED display, but sadly lacks a digital crown. It will have eight plating/bracelet combinations and seven interchangeable strap options. Both watches have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will start at $350. Misfit Vapor There are plenty of expensive products on this list, but if you're looking for a good value smartwatch, the Misfit Vapor might be the best choice. It's the second-cheapest Android Wear device on this list, at just $199, but it has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.39" circular display, water resistance up to 50 meters, Wi-Fi, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. However, I was unable to find confirmation that the Vapor included a speaker. Design-wise, the Misfit Vapor is definitely one of my favorites. It has a similar design to the Moto 360, but with a small bezel surrounding the screen instead of the 360's flat tire. It will launch in "Late Summer 2017." Diesel On Diesel's first Android Wear watch, the Diesel On, was announced earlier this year at Baselworld 2017. Hardly any useful information about it has been revealed, besides the fact that it uses a Snapdragon Wear 2100 processor and will have "hundreds of customization options." It looks like it has a digital crown, but we can't be sure. The watch will be available in "Holiday 2017," and will start at $350. Fossil Q Venture/Q Explorist Fossil's first Android Wear watch was released back in 2015, and the company followed up on it with two more in 2016. This year, Fossil is releasing the Q Venture and Q Explorist. Details on these are also incredibly sparse, but we do know both watches will have a Snapdragon Wear 2100 CPU and will be released in the Fall. It seems very likely that both watches have a flat tire display, as companies often try to use black watch faces in promotional material (such as the above image) to hide it. In fact, adjusting the brightness and contrast on the above image does reveal a flat tire. Movado Connect Movado's first Android Wear device, the Movado Connect, definitely looks sleek. It has an edge-to-edge 1.46" 400x400 circular display, a 300mAh battery, Wi-Fi connectivity, and NFC for Android Pay. However, it is worth noting that the Connect lacks a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. The watch will be available in Fall 2017, starting at $495. Hugo Boss Touch Another sleek Android Wear watch announced this year is the Hugo Boss Touch, priced at $395. The specifications are identical to the Movado Connect - Wear 2100 CPU, 300mAh battery, 1.46" 400x400 circular display, and Wi-Fi/NFC connectivity. Just like the Connect, it's missing a speaker, LTE, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy it this Fall. Tommy Hilfiger TH24/7You This watch wins the award for the worst smartwatch name, but it seems to be pretty good at everything else. It has a Wear 2100 processor, a 1.4" circular 400x400 display, and a 300mAh battery. The watch does have Wi-Fi support, but lacks a speaker, LTE, NFC, GPS, and a heart rate sensor. You'll be able to buy the TH24/7You in the Fall for $299 - making it one of the more competitively-priced options on this list. ZTE Quartz At $192, the ZTE Quartz is the least expensive watch on this list, barely beating out the Misfit Vapor. Currently exclusive to T-Mobile, the Quartz has a Wear 2100 CPU, 1.4" 400x400 circular display, and IP67 water resistance. It supports Wi-Fi, 3G, and GPS connectivity, but no NFC. There's also no heart rate sensor on the Quartz, but it does have the largest battery of any watch on this list at 500mAh. The carrier exclusivity is a bit of a bummer, but maybe we'll see an unlocked model show up in the future. Verizon Wear24 Verizon surprised everyone when it announced an LTE-capable Android Wear watch alongside the LG Watch Sport, undercutting the latter device in the process. The Wear24 has all the features of the Watch Sport, except Android Pay and a heart rate sensor. It does have an NFC chip, but it is not compatible with Android Pay. You can currently buy the Wear24 from Verizon for $349 outright or $300 on a two-year contract. Conclusion We're starting to see more and more actual watch companies invest in Android Wear, which I see as a good thing for the platform. Up until now, Android Wear has largely only been used by tech enthusiasts. I've seen plenty of people with Apple Watches (not as many as Apple would like, but still), but hardly anyone with Android Wear devices. Android Wear 2.0 in general is a bit of a mixed bag. While I personally don't mind the changes as much, others are much less happy about it, and for valid reasons. We'll have to see where the platform goes in the coming months (and years), but there is no shortage of watches to choose from.

Such a shame. Corbin Davenport That one was released in 2016. Dimitris Kanellopoulos Right. Sorry Raven ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It might also have been released late 2016, but it is a shame that you did not include the Asus ZenWatch 3 in this comparison. I think it is one of the best Wear 2100 based smart watches currently available and at only $209 it is a steal compared to some of the ones listed here. I am loving mine. Tucker Sferro scrolling down the list, I am amazed at the prices. I loved my Moto 360 1st gen, I paid $100 for it on Craigslist. That's exactly what it's worth. You know why? The battery died after about 18 months and it's now a brick. The general public doesnt want to pay more than $150 for a secondary "cell phone-like" piece of hardware that only lasts 2 years, period. Smartwatches will NEVER take off until the cost point drops dramatically. This is the same thing that e-readers went through, until Amazon stepped up to the plate and brought the costs dow. Thomas Paulsen A fellow Moto 360 1st gen user here with a dead battery. I paid top dollar and it burned me so much that I am holding back from another purchase. The only reasons that I would reconsider are being able to open smart locks with NFC, robust assistant voice control ("open garage door"), broader Android Pay availability and - of course - a moderate price because we all know gadgets become obsolete fast. Tucker Sferro I found an article online that shows you how to replace the battery ($15), but it involved cracking the plastic off the back of the 360, etc. I would also be unhappy if I paid full price. Thomas Paulsen This video was posted two months ago and details the battery swap: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1as_h5jnBM Lazyboy0172 Oh I am going to be very sad when my battery dies. I've had my 360 since september 2014 and have no battery problems so far, but I'll be very sad to lose it. That's really the only thing that will get me to replace it though, because right now the thought of spending $300+ on something newer with the only real difference being that it looks better does not make sense to me. And I think that's the problem with the market right now- the price points just aren't there between manufacturers and consumers. Consumers do not want to supplement their $500 phone with a $400 watch, and then have to replace that watch every couple years. But no manufacturer can afford to sell a nice looking watch at <$150 and then also not have any repeat customers for 3+ years. Tucker Sferro you bring up a good point, that manufacturers are unable to bring the costs down to a more attractive level, which is why someone like Amazon (shudders) might be able to lower the cost with a Fire watch, or something like that. Oh boy, ads on my watch?! I just threw up on myself. brkshr Replacing the battery costs about $10 and 20 minutes. Kyle R Krcmaric I just want to have Android Wear at or below $150 on a device that supports Android Pay. GreatNews You forgot to include the all new ZTE Quartz https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport You're right, I'll be adding it shortly. Rorison Meadows II I need a camera on a decent sized one for video calling and photos. Come on people! marcusmarcus2 Here you go :) http://www.doki.com/ Rorison Meadows II :-( you tease! Daniel Nava Best Buy has the LG Watch Style for $170 right now. I picked one up and could not be happier with it. I just wanted a nice looking basic Android Wear watch under $200 and I got it. Matt It's a shame that Wear 2.0 is so bad. Roy ?WHY kamiller42 Oh. Where do I begin? 1. The watch is no longer an extension of the phone. This hurts the convenience of using the watch. 2. Apps that used to work no longer. Most times, permissions have to be granted again. Other times, the watch app has lost connectivity with the phone. 3. Notifications which used to appear don't. 4. It's slower than previous versions. 5. Theater mode in 1 click, 1 swipe, and 2 taps vs 2 clicks. 6. DnD no longer works. Why? Because Google wants the watch to act as an independent device. DnD on watch and phone are not connected. A handful of people say that's great, but the situations they bring up are edge cases. Most people, when they say "Do not disturb me" means do not disturb me at all. 7. I have not figured out to answer the phone from the watch. The only option I see is to refuse call. Used to be simple. Swipe right to answer. Swipe left to refuse. Roy 1. It's great. Only need good sync. 2. Wich apps? 3. Why not? All the reviews says it's work. 4. Mmm for sure now they need to upgrade the hardware for independent os. 5. What's for? 6. You right about that. 7. I didn't hear about that. So if I can Make a summary no everything work flawless so it's good that I didn't buy one just yet but it doesn't mean that Android Wear 2.0 not in good Direction. I hated the first version. Matt Why is that a shame or why is it bad? Michael Maggard ZTE Quartz came out in 2017, has Android Wear 2.0, and is under US$200. https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/zte-quartz Corbin Davenport Yep, I'll be adding it to the post shortly. Derik Taylor Also, the ZTE Quartz does have GPS. In the description, you said it doesn't. :| (I have it, which is the only reason I knew that.) marcusmarcus2 The discription also says it has NFC but I cannot see that it does on the T mobile website or the ZTE website. Derik Taylor Huh...didn't notice that. No NFC. :( Not that I planned on using it anyway, but still would have been nice as an option. abqnm I see it's on there now. There's a bit of an error though. In the blurb for it, it says there IS NFC but NO GPS. It's the other way around. It HAS GPS and NO NFC. The entry in the table is correct though. Thanks for this post. It's a great way to compare at a glance. Corbin Davenport Yep, some info got mixed when I was adding the Quartz and Wear24 at the same time. Both the table and the article text should be correct now. abqnm Thanks, but it's not quite correct still. The Quartz description now says but no GPS, LTE, or NFC It does have GPS, but not LTE or NFC. marcusmarcus2 Third time's a charm http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/1a/1ab37c4fc16eae0cf8505ad03c1652fea7659118ab91a6fa386c4e1e514266aa.jpg Corbin Davenport I clearly can't write today. Fixed! abqnm Haha no worries. We've all been there. marcusmarcus2 https://www.zteusa.com/zte-quartz "500 mAh" Dang, it has the largest battery compared to those listed and it still only has "up to 36 hours of battery life per charge" Kyle Gospodnetich Are you guys ever going to talk about the joke that is the Android Wear 2.0 OTAs? Most watches don't even have it yet, and Google completely backed down on their 'fast update, all at once' promise. Dan W agreed. i was hoping that AP would hold Google's feet to the fire on the 2.0 updates. they've been a tragic reminder of how little Google and its partners care about timely updates. Captain On! It's hard to forget, but updates aren't solely on Google. Manufacturers and driver support can hold software updates back regardless of Google trying to shove it out the door. EcE But since there was such promise, shouldn't have Google "certified" the watches somehow? Ensuring that the updates can be pushed timely? kamiller42 Google is doing you a favor. AW 2.0 is a work in progress. Its flow is not as fast and fluid as previous. me me Agreed, I tried the Developer Preview, Watch become unusable. Ambition >> specifications. Carson Saldanha When did they say "fast update, all at once" Mayoo Honorable mention to one of the longest tags section I've seen on AP https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4be9fae6b2e3863638bc20bd2881a3021302f2677608ddc958771313cae23baf.png PJ Anderson The LG Watch Style has a speaker? David Ruddock It doesn't, the table has been corrected. IcerC The Verizon Wear24 comes out in less than a week right? Add that one. tu3218 Has Verizon even announced a date yet? Still nothing on their website. Rashad May 11 tu3218 Where did you see that? Rashad I added the link afterwards. tu3218 Good deal. Although I'm really still waiting for the gear S3. But we all know how that's going for Verizon. Corbin Davenport Yeah, I'll add that one as well. YaKillaCJ The messed up part is the Misfit Vapor is the clear winner in terms of aesthetics and specs when not factoring price. Yet it's priced ridiculously competitive. I think I will get it to upgrade my Moto 360 1st Gen. victor sanchez same here. jawsnnn It will probably have some glaring flaw when it comes out. That has been the pattern for Android Wear devices so far: Announcement,Excitement,Dashed hopes and dreams. Nick Coad Agreed, it's my favourite so far, but I'm really disappointed by the lack of a digital crown since it looks so useful for navigation. Boolean Corporation Mmh, maybe you already know this by now, but the Misfit has a touch enabled bezel that serves as a click/wheel and takes over the scroll/zoom functions of the digital crown. At least that's what it was announced. Nick Coad I did not know that, thank you! That does seem interesting. 005 anyone know if Misfit vapor has speaker if that has speaker that seals the deal all the way i can leave with out NFC for that price its hands down the best if only had spaker Corbin Davenport I found no mention of a speaker anywhere. 005 thanks hope they do because Huawei Watch 2 Classic went way down in design not sure what the heck happen ObligatoryEscapments It has 5ATM water resistance. In the Android Wear world, that means no speaker. (See: Casio, Nixon, Polar. All speakerless) i_say_uuhhh That Movado looks amazing, just wish it had a speaker and LTE. skillfulshoe Don't be fooled by that picture, it doesn't have an edge to edge screen. Not sure how AP missed that. https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/3/24/15052504/movado-android-wear-watch-connect-baselworld-2017 Roy THE CPU IS CRAP. marcusmarcus2 Really? I thought it was silicon. Roy Really why 28nm?! Stevie_Wonder The Misfit will probably be my first smartwatch. Might have some shortcomings, for example the lacking of NFC, but I don't think I will really need that since Android Pay isn't even launched here. Not sure if a speaker is really useful. And a question for the smartwatch users. My provider doesn't support a second sim so can't use the LTE option, but how useful is it and do you use it a lot? Will it connect through Bluetooth with your phone first and if that fails use LTE to connect? ObligatoryEscapments Casio is even stingier than Fossil with specs, but it's very surprising to hear that they've abandoned their custom SoC from the WSD-10 to use the Qualcomm. Also, I think it's a safe assumption the Verizon/Quanta Wear24 has a speaker. It's an LTE watch that makes phone calls. haberd I would love to see dimensions added. My major problem with this crop is they are too bulky for constant wear bābā ghanūj Full spec sheet for all Android Wear watches here! https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lbKhNnFBARrT5TVo3bkyp1UzT0S5Iahy3W9dAQf_sfc/edit#gid=0 ethd "The award for the longest smartwatch name goes to the TAG Heuer Connected Modular 45. This watch has an Intel Atom Z34XX processor (the same one the Casio watch uses), 1.39" 400x400 circular display, 410mAh battery, and speaker." I think you meant that it has the same processor the New Balance one uses. Your table and the article both say that the Casio Pro Trek uses a SDW2100. JD Seeing how Google Treats Android Wear. That's a big list of Casualties to add to the already long list of casualties. FlyOnTheWall No Polar M600? Corbin Davenport That was released last year. Jordan L Hey, my Huawei watch just got AW 2.0 final ( I think) it's updating now. Akshdeep For ZTE Quartz in the table you have mentioned screen size as 1.4 and 400x400 but below you have written 1.3 and 480x480. Please make correction. Corbin Davenport Thanks, it has been fixed. Carson Saldanha The table says the LG Watch Style has a speaker, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't. Might wanna fix that ;) jmwils3 Haven't gotten any final news from Verizon, as the csms don't have the information, but the NFC chip on the wear24 don't seem to be active and no Android pay present, at least currently. Who knows if an update will activate them by official launch day, but the fact the original verizon article has been edited to remove references to NFC and the product page is gone isn't all that encouraging. Iagoba Apellaniz Compass? I want to see the ability to point to north Richard Markert I have both gens of 360, but I'm going to get a Gear S3 Classic for my next smartwatch. Not going to do another Wear watch. lcasale Can't even buy the LG Sport. It's been sold out on the Google Store and Verizon has pushed back the pre-ordered twice now (by two months). I'm expecting them to miss the latest 5/11 ship date as well. b_boogey_xl I think I'll go with the Huawei Watch 2 Classic. The only knock I have with it is, no LTE (not a deal breaker but…) and I wish they left off those notches that do nothing for a digital watch 🙄. Don't really care for a digital crown since it doesn't have a greater function like it does on the Apple Watch, it just sounds like a "me too" feature. Now just to wait for the price to drop since everyone hates it… 😊. peterfares You sure the Wear24 doesn't have GPS? I think it does. OrangeSweater Are you sure the Misfit Vapor has LTE? The only thing I see listed on the product page is Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It seems odd that it would include LTE when it is so much cheaper than what is available from other companies. Chris Sells Which ones have a rotational crown? Kian Can someone confirm that the Tommy TH24/7You comes with NFC? So many other sites like Wearable.com say that it in fact does NOT have NFC. This is the only site that says it does.......

LightwaveRF makes devices that allow users to control things such as light, heat, power and security through an app on their mobile phone. Its customers will now be able to use Google’s new voice-controlled Home device instead. LightwaveRF already allows its customers to use Amazon’s ‘Alexa’ voice technology, featured as part of its Echo product range, and plans to team up with Apple on similar technology. LightwaveRF saw its shares rise by 48.4 per cent, or 7.5p, to 23p – a 16-month high. The day was less rosy for larger companies, with the FTSE falling 0.9 per cent, or 67.05 points, to 7436.42. It was hit by the unravelling of the so-called ‘Trump trade’, which has been boosting markets around the world since the US election late last year. Many stocks have suffered as critics argue that Donald Trump is failing to deliver on policy promises, while scrutiny of his alleged ties with Russia increases the risk of his impeachment. After a long period of benefiting from Trump’s plans to spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure, construction stocks were hit particularly hard yesterday by growing political turmoil in the US. Building equipment rental firm Ashtead Group was one of the FTSE’s biggest losers, down 1.2 per cent, or 18p, to 1542p, while construction and engineering firm Keller Group led losses in the FTSE 250, down 5.8 per cent, or 53p, to 863.5p. Building supplies firm Tyman fell 3 per cent, or 10.5p, to 335p, despite stellar results.

The firm, which mainly focuses on rare diseases, plans to submit a US marketing application for the drug by the end of this year or early next year, but it did not say how it is likely to be priced. Shares rose 1.8 per cent, or 83p, to 4814.5p. In the junior market, two celebrity-backed media groups rallied after confirming rumours that they could merge. Bob Geldof-backed TV producer Zinc Media confirmed that it was plotting a merger with Brave Bison, a YouTube movie maker backed by former Sun newspaper columnist Kelvin MacKenzie. Brave Bison also issued a note which said the two firms had held preliminary discussions. The two firms will confirm whether or not a deal is due to take place by June 15 at the latest. Zinc, which was set up under the name Ten Alps by Boomtown Rats singer Geldof, rose 4.9 per cent, or 0.05p, to 1.08p. Meanwhile, Brave Bison shot up 1.8 per cent, or 0.02p, to 1.45p – one of the day’s biggest risers, Marketing firm Proxama extended severe losses from its previous session after ousting the chief executive of its digital payments division. Mike Woods will step down from his role and the board immediately as part of a restructure. Earlier this week, the firm announced that it had decided against selling its digital payments division and will instead focus on reducing the division’s operating costs by £1m. It said that Woods’s resignation formed part of the process of cutting costs. Yesterday its shares fell another 11.5 per cent, or 0.03p, to 0.23p.

Google recently released a stable version of Android 7.1.2 Nougat for the Pixel. That’s the last official software update. However, in an effort to test and improve what’s coming next, the developer preview and Android O beta is another option. Read: How to Install Android O Right Now Users with any of Google’s recent devices are eligible for the Android O beta. We’ll be sharing details on the Pixel update and if it’s worth installing. If you’re considering trying Android O read on for some of the benefits and downsides. While Android 7.1.1 and even 7.1.2 were small maintenance releases for Nougat, Android O is a much bigger update. It’s the next big software release and will likely be called Android 8.0 Oreo, or something similar. Right now we don’t know too much about Android O. The first beta was very bare-bones, and the second preview was released on May 17th. Pixel owners can expect a third beta this summer, with the official release slated for August or September. However, on stage one Googler casually mentioned a summer release date. Read: What’s New in Android O: Everything You Should Know Today though, Android O is still pretty promising. Some new features include dynamic icons, bundled notifications, limiting background processes to improve battery life and other small tweaks. Google redesigned the settings menu, added picture-in-picture mode, and introduced auto-fill to apps. How Google Chrome remembers forms, login details and your address, something similar will happen inside Android apps. There’s a lot to like, and this is just the beginning of a larger update. Pixel owners will also enjoy the new Notification Dots on icons, which ties into the app shortcuts. Long-press an app icon on for tons of new options, quick access to aspects inside of the app, or see notifications at a glance. Not to mention potential fixes for a wide array of Pixel problems, like Bluetooth drops. Considering this is an early developer preview and new software, it is not the most stable version of Android available. In fact, Google themselves warned users about bugs and states it is not ready for daily use. The beta is for developers and to gather feedback, not to use on your primary device. Installing the Android O beta has its benefits but there are also downsides to using early software and we want to discuss those here. This list of reasons should help you decide if it is worth trying the Google Pixel Android O beta. Install Android O If You Like Living on the Edge   1 / 8 Google's developer preview betas are exactly that, an early developer preview. They aren't intended for anyone and everyone. Even though anyone that wants to try it can. Pixel owners will run into bugs, there's no question about that. Google themselves confirmed more than a few are present in the software. Furthermore, Google states a fix won't arrive until later this summer. That didn't stop me though. I have it on my Pixel XL and Pixel C tablet. The first beta had some crashes, but so far the second beta is running quite smooth.  This means that you should only install it if you like living on the edge, and can deal with these issues. Yes, it has some benefits, but also a few cons. So far the software runs pretty smooth, and battery life seems decent. Don't say we didn't warn you though.    1 / 8 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

On June 1, MLB’s At Bat app will be available in a VR mode, initially for Google’s Daydream headset and Android smartphones. That will let users access live stats and scores — all while watching games in HD video — including a 3D strike-zone cube that sits directly in front of the viewer. The At Bat VR mode also will provide a collection of 360-degree on-demand videos to view in the headset. “We think the next frontier for data visualization will be immersive,” said Jamie Leece, MLB Advanced Media’s VP of games and VR strategy on mobile, digital and social gaming platforms. But for now, the league’s VR ambitions won’t extend to the game broadcasts themselves. MLB has experimented with producing live games in VR and expects to deliver a full game in virtual reality sometime later in 2017, according to Leece. Stumbling blocks include the cost of the cameras. There’s also the problem of producing VR broadcasts of baseball games that bring fans into all the action – a challenge given that MLB ballparks cover a playing area of 50,000 square feet or more, Leece added. The VR features in the At Bat app, such as they are, will be available to subscribers at no additional cost. At Bat is available for $2.99 per month (or $19.99 annually). To watch live games in the app, users must subscribe to MLB.TV Premium, which costs $24.99 monthly (or $112.99 for the whole season) and includes access to At Bat. Who’s this really going to appeal to? Besides early adopters of VR and stat-driven baseball fans, the At Bat VR experience will be of interest to cord-cutters, Leece suggested. That’s because the app’s VR headset provides a field of view that’s equivalent to the biggest HDTVs on the market. MLBAM has been developed At Bat VR for about a year, and the league will add support other VR platforms in the future, according to Leece. At the Google I/O developer conference this week, the company announced partnerships with HTC and Lenovo to build standalone Daydream-compatible VR headsets. Separately Thursday, MLB and Facebook announced a live-streaming deal under which the social platform will broadcast 20 free games (one game per week) this season. MLB Advanced Media is separate from BAMTech, the streaming-video infrastructure entity that is majority-owned by Major League Baseball with Disney holding a 33% stake.

Google Lens is AR you can actually use Google's new technology lets you search with your phone's camera. It's augmented reality beyond photo filters. Mobile by Richard Nieva May 18, 2017 5:10 AM PDT @richardjnieva Enlarge Image Google Lens can tell you what type of flower you're looking at. Just point your camera at it. James Martin/CNET Snapchat made a big mark on augmented reality by putting digital flower crowns on real people. Now Google may make its own mark by showing you digital information about real flowers. On Wednesday, the search giant announced a big push into augmented reality, which overlays digital images on what you'd normally see through a camera. The new technology, announced at the company's I/O developer conference, is called Google Lens. It's a way to use your phone's camera to search for information. For example, point your camera at that flower and Google will tell you what kind it is. Point it at a book, and you get information on the author and see reviews. Ditto with restaurants: You'll be able to see reviews and pricing information on a little digital card that appears above the building on your phone's screen. With Lens, Google can "understand what you're looking at and help you take action," CEO Sundar Pichai said on stage Wednesday. "We can give you the right information in a meaningful way." Google is first launching Lens in the Assistant, its digital helper software, and in Google Photos. It will be available at an unspecified date "later this year." Google Lens marks a big, ambitious attempt by a mainstream company to get into augmented reality in a way we haven't much seen yet. Snapchat, Facebook and Instagram (owned by Facebook) use AR for now to make you laugh and smile with filters like rainbow vomit or Iron Man masks. That stuff is important, but Google is taking a different approach when it comes to AR: utility. "There are these other aspects of AR that involve creative expression," Aravind Krishnaswamy, head of engineering at Google Photos, said in an interview. "That's not what we're trying to do." Others are trying to get the AR engine revving. Pinterest has a similar feature also called Lens, but it's mostly focused on buying. Microsoft has long been pushing AR through its HoloLens headset, but there's no consumer product in sight. Because Google is employing its technology in widely used Android phones, it has the scale to reach a massive audience once it launches. For Google, it's important to expand search beyond its iconic homepage. The world is a lot different than when Larry Page and Sergey Brin started the company as graduate students at Stanford. Search was a thing for desktop computers and typing on a keyboard. Now -- who knows? It's for tapping on a smartphone screen, barking orders at a device in your kitchen or, if Mark Zuckerberg gets his way, eventually sending your thoughts straight to a computer. Google knows the way of the world is changing, and it's trying to get out in front. 'Get stuff done' Right now, AR is having a moment. Last September, when Snapchat renamed itself Snap and started calling itself a "camera company," people were baffled. But the young upstart realized the time was right for phone cameras to take advantage of augmented reality. Facebook, sensing that Snapchat was onto something, decided to build the future of its app around smartphone cameras, too. Last month, Zuckerberg announced a new augmented reality platform, which invites outside developers to create AR experiences for Facebook. The promise of augmented reality is profound. With a good pair of AR glasses, you might be able to tell if your kid has a fever just by looking at him or her. You might never have to buy a TV again if you could just project a big screen over your eyes. And you'll never experience the awkwardness of forgetting someone's name, because it will appear right over their head. Of course, we're not there yet. But Google thinks it can lead the way because of everything it knows about you and the world. That's where being a search company comes in handy. Google is taking its big trove of data and trying to make it three-dimensional. "It's our core mission, accessing the world's information," Gummi Hafsteinsson, product lead for the Assistant, said in an interview, citing Google's mission statement. "Images are just another part of that." What Google has going for it is scale, said Chirag Dekate, a research director at Gartner. Google has a good shot at being accurate with the information it presents in AR because of Google's knowledge about your surroundings. Companies like that have a "distinct data advantage," he said. To be sure, Facebook and Snapchat have AR plans beyond photo filters. Facebook is working on AR glasses, but that will take years. And Snapchat has its Spectacles glasses, which will likely be a vehicle for more advanced AR. But for now, they are mostly just for taking snaps. Google's goal is to be helpful. David Lieb, product lead for Google Photos, in an interview summed up the approach: "We're doing this to help you get stuff done."

Name: Subject: Message: Chromebooks may get some Android O features before they show up on phones Newsby John Callaham9 hours ago 1 111 5 One year ago at Google I/O 2016, the company announced that it would soon allow Chrome OS and Chromebooks to run Android apps from the Google Play Store. At the time the company said that this support would be available in the fall of 2016. Since then, this feature has been very slow to roll out. Today, as part of the 2017 Google I/O conference, the company offered an update on those plans, and had some surprising news that relates to Android O as well. See also: Best Chromebooks March 15, 2017 As we have reported before, Google currently only has six Chrome OS devices that can download and run Android apps on the stable version of the OS. In a story on The Verge, Kan Liu, the senior director of product management at Google for Chrome OS, stated that support for running Android apps in Chrome OS is still considered to be in a beta state. He added that at the moment, Chrome OS is “80 percent” ready for Android apps, at least for most users. The question is how long it will take to get that last 20 percent finished before Android app support ditches the beta label. At the moment, there’s no word on when exactly that will happen. However, Liu did mention something that might excite Chromebook owners. Because Chrome OS launches new stable builds every six weeks or so, that means features that are in development for Android on phones may show up on Chromebooks first, due to Android having longer update cycles. Liu specifically mentioned the Android O app improvements in keyboard shortcuts will begin working on apps first on Chromebooks before they show up on smartphones. The upcoming Samsung Chromebook Pro is now available for pre-order and is supposed to start shipping on May 28. Liu says it will be the first Chromebook to add a number of Android app features, including window resizing, docking apps to the side of the screen, and split-view. While all of this this sounds good, the truth is that Google over-promised somewhat in 2016 with its Android-Chromebooks plans. Hopefully, we will see more progress on this front in the next year.
