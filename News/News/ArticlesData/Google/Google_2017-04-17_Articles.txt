What Does Mobile-First Security Look Like? Apr 17, 2017 Derek Walter EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Getty Images Advertisement The only phrase you’re likely to hear more often than “mobile first” is “mobile security.” But what does mobile-first security looks like?  The question is turning out to be a big deal, and getting a lot of attention from Microsoft, Google, and other companies that want to be the harbinger for all of your productivity. Turning your company’s data over to Office 365 or G Suite is going to be more appealing if there’s a strong sense that all the information will be safe from malicious third parties, yet easy for you to manage. There’s been a lot of news around this topic in the last few weeks, with Google making a ton of announcements at its Cloud Next conference and Microsoft bringing its Teams work chat application into the wild. Nearly everything these companies do lately has a major impact on the concept of being mobile first. Effective mobile work relies on speed, access to the cloud, and security. Here are a few of the most recent happenings in this area that may be items to work through when it comes to how to best ensure your company’s workflow is secure and mobile ready. Security at the Chip Level One of the most interesting announcements I’ve seen in a while when it comes to hardware and security was dangling from the ear of Google’s Urs Holzle,  senior VP for technical infrastructure, at the company's recent Cloud Next conference. He debuted Google’s Titan chip, which was designed with a “layered security architecture, spanning the physical security of data centers to secure boot across hardware and software to operational security,” according to Google’s announcement. The  talk of security and its application to mobile devices was everywhere. G Suite users could rest assured their data and secure documentation were inside a secure Fortress Google thanks in part to the $20 billion that Alphabet chairman Eric Schmidt boasted of spending on it. It better be, because we’ve reached an inflection point where it’s so much easier to go all-in with cloud than some type of hybrid model that many companies have been clinging to. When you can sign up for a G Suite or Office 365 account and cheaply add new users and dish out access, you’re quickly adding in a lot of content and files that need to be monitored and secure. The message you get from Google in this area is clear - you won’t need to worry about someone getting at your stuff as long as you use good security practices. Google’s custom chip is built to put security at the hardware level. Diving into mobile device management Mobile device management is a phrase that can send anyone’s head spinning for how many potential problems exist when it comes to company data. But this is a critical component of mobile-first security. Office 365 offers a clear mobile device management strategy for an organization. Both Google and Microsoft have guidelines and policies about how to effectively manage data, devices, and distribute access to applications. Even if your shop is BYOD (bring your own device), you’re still doing device management because both Office 365 and G Suite grant you the power to confer access for particular applications and varying types of data archival. This also may mean setting specific policies for device usage, even if you’re not directly issuing each device. Take the time to get to know how each cloud provider handles device management, and this may help you decide which is the best cloud to go with. A Smarter Cloud Requires Smarter Security The mobile-first mantra isn’t just about the convenience of having a device in your hand. It’s because all of that data flowing through your Google or Microsoft account is being analyzed by those companies to (hopefully) empower you to work smarter. You can require screen locks or wipe data with G Suite’s mobile device management policies. For example, Google has a new series of APIs for recognizing objects in videos, which could do wonders for editing and advertising campaigns, embodying the whole pitch behind Google Cloud, i.e. it’s the smarter cloud, enabling companies that use it to find out both the work they’re doing and what you need to do each day. But if your cloud is going to be doing some of the thinking for you, it better be sure and not leak any of that information out to more nefarious sources. This is why a mobile device management policy, secure practices, and rock solid security from the cloud provider are all critical. Microsoft executive Brad Anderson recently released a video that claims to tell you everything you’d ever want to know about enterprise mobile security. It’s a good reminder that Microsoft is going to continue to compete very vigorously in this space, and may give you some tips about how to manage this critical area. Essentially, mobile-first security isn’t terribly different from just good security practices. However, things move more quickly and require a deep understanding of managing security and data with a cloud provider. The cloud is smarter, but everything it knows means that it must be protected.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 April 2017 | MYT 12:30 PM Google to open up Android to rivals in out-of-court deal with Russia Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications, as part of a deal with FAS, the regulator said. — Reuters MOSCOW: Alphabet Inc's Google will open up its popular Android mobile operating system to rival search engines in Russia as part of a deal to settle a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities.  The deal sets a new precedent for the tech giant, which faces multiple complaints worldwide that it is abusing its dominant position by imposing restrictions on manufacturers of Android-based devices in order to protect its share of the online search market.  Russia's competition watchdog, FAS, ruled in 2015 that Google was breaking the law by requiring the pre-installation of applications, including its own search tool, on mobile devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia's Yandex.  Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications, as part of a deal with FAS, the regulator said on Monday.  It will also develop a tool allowing users to choose a default search engine on their Android devices.  "Users will be able to change settings at any time and choose the default search engine which suits their needs," FAS said.  Google confirmed the deal, saying it met the interests of all parties. It also said it had reached a commercial agreement with Yandex that "provides new opportunities for Yandex to promote its search service within Chrome (Internet browser)."  Alexander Shulgin, head of Yandex Russian operations, said he hoped the agreement will have implications for similar cases in Europe and elsewhere.  Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up 7.2% by 1534 GMT to US$24.39 (RM107.52) while Google was up 1.2%.  The deal is for a term of six years and nine months and was approved by a Russian court earlier on Monday. Under the terms of the agreement, Google will still have to pay a total of 439mil roubles (RM34.63mil) in fines. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested US scientists track fish migration using DNA in water samples Study links media violence to aggressive behaviour, regardless of culture Cleveland murder highlights perils of video for Facebook Vehicle-sharing services offer range of driving experiences How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Thai government campaign sees drop in road deaths during Songkran festival Enchanting beach of black rocks ‘Malaysia an oasis of Chinese culture’ advertisement Latest News Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash Crude palm oil price falls deeper into bear market Phone app nabs Coachella festival cellphone thief KWAP to take up 136.6m edotco shares for RM400m Malaysia's timber exports to improve 5% this year Most Viewed in Tech SWIFT warns on vendor security after documents leaked by hackers Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings National search launched for alleged US ‘Facebook killer’ Intel to stop hosting the annual Intel Developer Forum Snap stock falls as alleged CEO comments rile some on social media New York City taxi commission plans to force Uber to add driver tipping feature Online ads target Britain’s homeless youths with offer of shelter for sex: charity Will autonomous driving kill the sports car?

I was living alone in Chicago’s southern industrial sector and working nights as a cocktail waitress. I was not well. Beyond the people I worked with, I spoke to almost no one. I clocked out at three each morning, went to after-hours bars, and came home on the first train of the morning, my head pressed against the window so as to avoid the spectre of my reflection appearing and disappearing in the blackened glass. At Bible school, I had studied a branch of theology that divided all of history into successive stages by which God revealed his truth. We were told we were living in the “Dispensation of Grace”, the penultimate era, which precedes that glorious culmination, the “Millennial Kingdom”, when the clouds part and Christ returns and life is altered beyond comprehension. But I no longer believed in this future. More than the death of God, I was mourning the dissolution of this narrative, which envisioned all of history as an arc bending towards a moment of final redemption. It was a loss that had fractured even my experience of time. My hours had become non-hours. Days seemed to unravel and circle back on themselves. The Kurzweil book belonged to a bartender at the jazz club where I worked. He lent it to me a couple of weeks after I’d seen him reading it and asked him – more out of boredom than genuine curiosity – what it was about. I read the first pages on the train home from work, in the grey and ghostly hours before dawn. “The 21st century will be different,” Kurzweil wrote. “The human species, along with the computational technology it created, will be able to solve age-old problems … and will be in a position to change the nature of mortality in a postbiological future.” How do you sell God in the 21st century? More heaven, less hell | Meghan O’Gieblyn Read more Like the theologians at my Bible school, Kurzweil, who is now a director of engineering at Google and a leading proponent of a philosophy called transhumanism, had his own historical narrative. He divided all of evolution into successive epochs. We were living in the fifth epoch, when human intelligence begins to merge with technology. Soon we would reach the “Singularity”, the point at which we would be transformed into what Kurzweil called “Spiritual Machines”. We would transfer or “resurrect” our minds onto supercomputers, allowing us to live forever. Our bodies would become incorruptible, immune to disease and decay, and we would acquire knowledge by uploading it to our brains. Nanotechnology would allow us to remake Earth into a terrestrial paradise, and then we would migrate to space, terraforming other planets. Our powers, in short, would be limitless. It’s difficult to account for the totemic power I ascribed to the book. I carried it with me everywhere, tucked in the recesses of my backpack, though I was paranoid about being seen with it in public. It seemed to me a work of alchemy or a secret gospel. It is strange, in retrospect, that I was not more sceptical of these promises. I’d grown up in the kind of millenarian sect of Christianity where pastors were always throwing out new dates for the Rapture. But Kurzweil’s prophecies seemed different because they were bolstered by science. Moore’s law held that computer processing power doubled every two years, meaning that technology was developing at an exponential rate. Thirty years ago, a computer chip contained 3,500 transistors. Today it has more than 1bn. By 2045, Kurzweil predicted, the technology would be inside our bodies. At that moment, the arc of progress would curve into a vertical line. Many transhumanists such as Kurzweil contend that they are carrying on the legacy of the Enlightenment – that theirs is a philosophy grounded in reason and empiricism, even if they do lapse occasionally into metaphysical language about “transcendence” and “eternal life”. As I read more about the movement, I learned that most transhumanists are atheists who, if they engage at all with monotheistic faith, defer to the familiar antagonisms between science and religion. “The greatest threat to humanity’s continuing evolution,” writes the transhumanist Simon Young, “is theistic opposition to Superbiology in the name of a belief system based on blind faith in the absence of evidence.” Yet although few transhumanists would likely admit it, their theories about the future are a secular outgrowth of Christian eschatology. The word transhuman first appeared not in a work of science or technology but in Henry Francis Carey’s 1814 translation of Dante’s Paradiso, the final book of the Divine Comedy. Dante has completed his journey through paradise and is ascending into the spheres of heaven when his human flesh is suddenly transformed. He is vague about the nature of his new body. “Words may not tell of that transhuman change,” he writes. Dante, in this passage, is dramatising the resurrection, the moment when, according to Christian prophecies, the dead will rise from their graves and the living will be granted immortal flesh. The vast majority of Christians throughout the ages have believed that these prophecies would happen supernaturally – God would bring them about, when the time came. But since the medieval period, there has also persisted a tradition of Christians who believed that humanity could enact the resurrection through science and technology. The first efforts of this sort were taken up by alchemists. Roger Bacon, a 13th-century friar who is often considered the first western scientist, tried to develop an elixir of life that would mimic the effects of the resurrection as described in Paul’s epistles. The Enlightenment failed to eradicate projects of this sort. If anything, modern science provided more varied and creative ways for Christians to envision these prophecies. In the late 19th century, a Russian Orthodox ascetic named Nikolai Fedorov was inspired by Darwinism to argue that humans could direct their own evolution to bring about the resurrection. Up to this point, natural selection had been a random phenomenon, but now, thanks to technology, humans could intervene in this process. Calling on biblical prophecies, he wrote: “This day will be divine, awesome, but not miraculous, for resurrection will be a task not of miracle but of knowledge and common labour.” According to Kurzweil, we would soon reach the Singularity, when we would be transformed into ‘Spiritual Machines’ This theory was carried into the 20th century by Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a French Jesuit priest and palaeontologist who, like Fedorov, believed that evolution would lead to the Kingdom of God. In 1949, Teilhard proposed that in the future all machines would be linked to a vast global network that would allow human minds to merge. Over time, this unification of consciousness would lead to an intelligence explosion – the “Omega Point” – enabling humanity to “break through the material framework of Time and Space” and merge seamlessly with the divine. The Omega Point is an obvious precursor to Kurzweil’s Singularity, but in Teilhard’s mind, it was how the biblical resurrection would take place. Christ was guiding evolution toward a state of glorification so that humanity could finally merge with God in eternal perfection. Transhumanists have acknowledged Teilhard and Fedorov as forerunners of their movement, but the religious context of their ideas is rarely mentioned. Most histories of the movement attribute the first use of the term transhumanism to Julian Huxley, the British eugenicist and close friend of Teilhard’s who, in the 1950s, expanded on many of the priest’s ideas in his own writings – with one key exception. Huxley, a secular humanist, believed that Teilhard’s visions need not be grounded in any larger religious narrative. In 1951, he gave a lecture that proposed a non-religious version of the priest’s ideas. “Such a broad philosophy,” he wrote, “might perhaps be called, not Humanism, because that has certain unsatisfactory connotations, but Transhumanism. It is the idea of humanity attempting to overcome its limitations and to arrive at fuller fruition.” The contemporary iteration of the movement arose in San Francisco in the late 1980s among a band of tech-industry people with a libertarian streak. They initially called themselves Extropians and communicated through newsletters and at annual conferences. Kurzweil was one of the first major thinkers to bring these ideas into the mainstream and legitimise them for a wider audience. His ascent in 2012 to a director of engineering position at Google, heralded, for many, a symbolic merger between transhumanist philosophy and the clout of major technological enterprise. Transhumanists today wield enormous power in Silicon Valley – entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel identify as believers – where they have founded thinktanks such as the Singularity University and the Future of Humanity Institute. The ideas proposed by the pioneers of the movement are no longer abstract theoretical musings but are being embedded into emerging technologies at organisations such as Google, Apple, Tesla and SpaceX. Losing faith in God in the 21st century is an anachronistic experience. You end up contending with the kinds of things the west dealt with more than a hundred years ago: materialism, the end of history, the death of the soul. When I think back on that period of my life, what I recall most viscerally is an unnamable sense of dread. There were days I woke in a panic, certain that I’d lost some essential part of myself in the fume of a blackout, and would work my fingers across my nose, my lips, my eyebrows, and my ears until I assured myself that everything was intact. My body had become strange to me; it seemed insubstantial. I went out of my way to avoid subway grates because I believed I could slip through them. One morning, on the train home from work, I became convinced that my flesh was melting into the seat. At the time, I would have insisted that my rituals of self-abuse – drinking, pills, the impulse to put my body in danger in ways I now know were deliberate – were merely efforts to escape; that I was contending, however clumsily, with the overwhelming despair at the absence of God. But at least one piece of that despair came from the knowledge that my body was no longer a sacred vessel; that it was not a temple of the holy spirit, formed in the image of God and intended to carry me into eternity; that my body was matter, and any harm I did to it was only aiding the unstoppable process of entropy for which it was destined. To confront this reality after believing otherwise is to experience perhaps the deepest sense of loss we are capable of as humans. It’s not just about coming to terms with the fact that you will die. It has something to do with suspecting that there is no difference between your human flesh and the plastic seat of the train. It has to do with the inability to watch your reflection appear and vanish in a window without coming to believe you are identical to it. What makes the transhumanist movement so seductive is that it promises to restore, through science, the transcendent hopes that science itself has obliterated. Transhumanists do not believe in the existence of a soul, but they are not strict materialists, either. Kurzweil claims he is a “patternist”, characterising consciousness as the result of biological processes, “a pattern of matter and energy that persists over time”. These patterns, which contain what we tend to think of as our identity, are currently running on physical hardware – the body – that will one day give out. But they can, at least in theory, be transferred onto supercomputers, robotic surrogates or human clones. A pattern, transhumanists would insist, is not the same as a soul. But it’s not difficult to see how it satisfies the same longing. At the very least, a pattern suggests that there is some essential core of our being that will survive and perhaps transcend the inevitable degradation of flesh. Of course, mind uploading has spurred all kinds of philosophical anxieties. If the pattern of your consciousness is transferred onto a computer, is the pattern “you” or a simulation of your mind? One camp of transhumanists have argued that true resurrection can happen only if it is bodily resurrection. They tend to favour cryonics and bionics, which promise to resurrect the entire body or else supplement the living form with technologies to indefinitely extend life. It is perhaps not coincidental that an ideology that grew out of Christian eschatology would come to inherit its philosophical problems. The question of whether the resurrection would be corporeal or merely spiritual was an obsessive point of debate among early Christians. One faction, which included the Gnostic sects, argued that only the soul would survive death; another insisted that the resurrection was not a true resurrection unless it revived the body. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Photograph: Liam Norris/Getty Images Transhumanists, in their eagerness to preempt charges of dualism, tend to sound an awful lot like these early church fathers. Eric Steinhart, a “digitalist” philosopher at William Paterson University, is among the transhumanists who insist the resurrection must be physical. “Uploading does not aim to leave the flesh behind,” he writes, “on the contrary, it aims at the intensification of the flesh.” The irony is that transhumanists are arguing these questions as though they were the first to consider them. Their discussions give no indication that these debates belong to a theological tradition that stretches back to the earliest centuries of the Common Era. While the effects of my deconversion were often felt physically, the root causes were mostly cerebral. My doubts began in earnest during my second year at Bible school, after I read The Brothers Karamazov and entertained, for the first time, the problem of how evil could exist in a world created by a benevolent God. In our weekly dormitory prayer groups, my classmates would assure me that all Christians struggled with these questions, but the stakes in my case were higher because I was planning to become a missionary after graduation. I nodded deferentially as my friends supplied the familiar apologetics, but afterward, in the silence of my dorm room, I imagined myself evangelising a citizen of some remote country and crumbling at the moment she pointed out those theological contradictions I myself could not abide or explain. I knew other people who had left the church, and was amazed at how effortlessly they had seemed to cast off their former beliefs. Perhaps I clung to the faith because, despite my doubts, I found – and still find – the fundamental promises of Christianity beautiful, particularly the notion that human existence ultimately resolves into harmony. What I could not reconcile was the idea that an omnipotent and benevolent God could allow for so much suffering. Transhumanism offered a vision of redemption without the thorny problems of divine justice. It was an evolutionary approach to eschatology, one in which humanity took it upon itself to bring about the final glorification of the body and could not be blamed if the path to redemption was messy or inefficient. Within months of encountering Kurzweil, I became totally immersed in transhumanist philosophy. By this point, it was early December and the days had grown dark. The city was besieged by a series of early winter storms, and snow piled up on the windowsills, silencing the noise outside. I increasingly spent my afternoons at the public library, researching things like nanotechnology and brain-computer interfaces. Once, after following link after link, I came across a paper called “Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?” It was written by the Oxford philosopher and transhumanist Nick Bostrom, who used mathematical probability to argue that it’s “likely” that we currently reside in a Matrix-like simulation of the past created by our posthuman descendants. Most of the paper consisted of esoteric calculations, but I became rapt when Bostrom started talking about the potential for an afterlife. If we are essentially software, he noted, then after we die we might be “resurrected” in another simulation. Or we could be “promoted” by the programmers and brought to life in base reality. The theory was totally naturalistic – all of it was possible without any appeals to the supernatural – but it was essentially an argument for intelligent design. “In some ways,” Bostrom conceded, “the posthumans running a simulation are like gods in relation to the people inhabiting the simulation”. One afternoon, deep in the bowels of an online forum, I discovered a link to a cache of “simulation theology” – articles written by fans of Bostrom’s theory. According to the “Argument for Virtuous Engineers”, it was reasonable to assume that our creators were benevolent because the capacity to build sophisticated technologies required “long-term stability” and “rational purposefulness”. These qualities could not be cultivated without social harmony, and social harmony could be achieved only by virtuous beings. The articles were written by software engineers, programmers and the occasional philosopher. The deeper I got into the articles, the more unhinged my thinking became. One day, it occurred to me: perhaps God was the designer and Christ his digital avatar, and the incarnation his way of entering the simulation to share tips about our collective survival as a species. Or maybe the creation of our world was a competition, a kind of video game in which each participating programmer invented one of the world religions, sent down his own prophet-avatar and received points for every new convert. By this point I’d passed beyond idle speculation. A new, more pernicious thought had come to dominate my mind: transhumanist ideas were not merely similar to theological concepts but could in fact be the events described in the Bible. It was only a short time before my obsession reached its culmination. I got out my old study Bible and began to scan the prophetic literature for signs of the cybernetic revolution. I began to wonder whether I could pray to beings outside the simulation. I had initially been drawn to transhumanism because it was grounded in science. In the end, I became consumed with the kind of referential mania and blind longing that animates all religious belief. I’ve since had to distance myself from prolonged meditation on these topics. People who once believed, I have been told, are prone to recidivism. Over the past decade, as transhumanism has become the premise of Hollywood blockbusters and a passable topic of small talk among people under 40, I’ve had to excuse myself from conversations, knowing that any mention of simulation theory or the noosphere can send me spiralling down that techno-theological rabbit hole. Last spring, a friend of mine from Bible school, a fellow apostate, sent me an email with the title “robot evangelism”. “I seem to recall you being into this stuff,” he said. There was a link to an episode of The Daily Show that had aired a year ago. The video was a satirical report by the correspondent Jordan Klepper called “Future Christ”, in which a Florida pastor, Christopher Benek, argued that in the future, AI could be evangelised just like humans. The interview had been heavily edited, and it wasn’t really clear what Benek believed, except that robots might one day be capable of spiritual life, an idea that failed to strike me as intrinsically absurd. One transhumanist believes we may reside in a Matrix-like simulation of the past created by our posthuman descendants I Googled Benek. He had studied to be a pastor at Princeton Theological Seminary, one of the most prestigious in the country. He described himself in his bio as a “techno-theologian, futurist, ethicist, Christian Transhumanist, public speaker and writer”. He also chaired the board of something called the Christian Transhumanism Association. I followed a link to the organisation’s website, which included that peculiar quote from Dante: “Words cannot tell of that transhuman change.” All this seemed unlikely. Was it possible there were now Christian Transhumanists? Actual believers who thought the Kingdom of God would come about through the Singularity? I had thought I was alone in drawing these parallels between transhumanism and biblical prophecy, but the convergences seemed to have gained legitimacy from the pulpit. How long would it be before everyone noticed the symmetry of these two ideologies – before Kurzweil began quoting the Gospel of John and Bostrom was read alongside the minor prophets? A few months later, I met with Benek at a cafe across the street from his church in Fort Lauderdale. In my email to him, I’d presented my curiosity as journalistic, unable to admit – even to myself – what lay behind my desire to meet. He arrived in the same navy blazer he had worn for The Daily Show interview and appeared nervous. The Daily Show had been a disaster, he told me. He had spoken with them for an hour about the finer points of his theology, but the interview had been cut down to his two-minute spiel on robots – something he insisted he wasn’t even interested in, it was just a thought experiment he had been goaded into. “It’s not like I spend my days speculating on how to evangelise robots,” he said. I explained that I wanted to know whether transhumanist ideas were compatible with Christian eschatology. Was it possible that technology would be the avenue by which humanity achieved the resurrection and immortality? I worried that the question sounded a little deranged, but Benek appeared suddenly energised. It turned out he was writing a dissertation on precisely this subject. “Technology has a role in the process of redemption,” he said. Christians today assume the prophecies about bodily perfection and eternal life are going to be realised in heaven. But the disciples understood those prophecies as referring to things that were going to take place here on Earth. Jesus had spoken of the Kingdom of God as a terrestrial domain, albeit one in which the imperfections of earthly existence were done away with. This idea, he assured me, was not unorthodox; it was just old. I asked Benek about humility. Wasn’t it all about the fallen nature of the flesh and our tragic limitations as humans? “Sure,” he said. He paused a moment, as though debating whether to say more. Finally, he leaned in and rested his elbows on the table, his demeanour markedly pastoral, and began speaking about the transfiguration and the nature of Christ. Jesus, he reminded me, was both fully human and fully God. What was interesting, he said, was that science had actually verified the potential for matter to have two distinct natures. Superposition, a principle in quantum theory, suggests that an object can be in two places at one time. A photon could be a particle, and it could also be a wave. It could have two natures. “When Jesus tells us that if we have faith nothing will be impossible for us, I think he means that literally.” By this point, I had stopped taking notes. It was late afternoon, and the cafe was washed in amber light. Perhaps I was a little dehydrated, but Benek’s ideas began to make perfect sense. This was, after all, the promise implicit in the incarnation: that the body could be both human and divine, that the human form could walk on water. “Very truly I tell you,” Christ had said to his disciples, “whoever believes in me will do the works I have been doing, and they will do even greater things than these.” His earliest followers had taken this promise literally. Perhaps these prophecies had pointed to the future achievements of humanity all along, our ability to harness technology to become transhuman. Christ had spoken mostly in parables – no doubt for good reason. If a superior being had indeed come to Earth to prophesy the future to 1st-century humans, he would not have wasted time trying to explain modern computing or sketching the trajectory of Moore’s law on a scrap of papyrus. He would have said, “You will have a new body,” and “All things will be changed beyond recognition,” and “On Earth as it is in heaven.” Perhaps only now that technologies were emerging to make such prophecies a reality could we begin to understand what Christ meant about the fate of our species. I could sense my reason becoming loosened by the lure of these familiar conspiracies. Somewhere, in the pit of my stomach, it was amassing: the fevered, elemental hope that the tumult of the world was authored and intentional, that our profound confusion would one day click into clarity and the broken body would be restored. Part of me was still helpless against the pull of these ideas. It was late. The cafe had emptied and a barista was sweeping near our table. As we stood to go, I felt that our conversation was unresolved. I suppose I’d been hoping that Benek would hand me some portal back to the faith, one paved by the certitude of modern science. But if anything had become clear to me, it was my own desperation, my willingness to spring at this largely speculative ideology that offered a vestige of that first religious promise. I had disavowed Christianity, and yet I had spent the past 10 years hopelessly trying to re-create its visions by dreaming about our postbiological future – a modern pantomime of redemption. What else could lie behind this impulse but the ghost of that first hope?

By India Ashok Updated April 18, 2017 07:17 BST The deal sets a precedent for Google, which currently faces numerous complaints across the globeiStock Google has agreed to open its Android OS to Russian search engines as part of a landmark out-of-court settlement reached between the tech giant and Russian competition authorities, to settle a two-year long legal dispute. FAS (Federal Antimonopoly Service) – Russia's competition watchdog – ruled in 2015 that Google was violating the law by mandating pre-installation of its own apps, including its search tool on Android devices, following a complaint filed by Russian search engine giant Yandex. The California-headquartered firm was fined roubles 438,067,400 ($7.8m, £6.2m) and has agreed that it will be less restrictive regarding the apps Android phone manufacturers can pre-install on devices in Russia. The FAS said in a statement that according to the terms of the settlement, Google can no longer "demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia", it will not restrict competing search engines from pre-installing apps, nor will it make its own search engine the only option for Android devices. The tech giant will also be developing a home screen widget – for current Android devices in Russia – that will allow users to choose their default search engine. "Users will be able to change settings at any time and choose the default search engine which suits their needs," the FAS said and added, "At the same time, Google will by no means limit or impede pre-installation of other developers' applications on the users' devices." Meanwhile, Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh deemed the settlement an "important day for Russian consumers" and thanked the competition watchdog for "applying the law in a manner that effectively and efficiently restores competition to the market for the benefit of Russian users". He also lauded Google for its cooperation and "recognizing the value of openness". "Under the terms of the settlement, 55 million Russian Android users will be offered a choice of search engines on their mobile devices," Volozh said. "Smartphone manufacturers will also have more freedom to select the apps that they preinstall on devices." A Google spokesperson told Engadget, "We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia's competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android." The deal sets a precedent for Google, which currently faces numerous complaints across the globe for allegedly imposing unfair restrictions on Android device manufacturers to protect its interests in the online search market.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 294 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares508 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google, Russia reach $7.8 million settlement in Android antitrust case Google has reached a settlement with Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) agency in the two year Android antitrust case. In 2015, Russian search rival Yandex had complained that Google was abusing its position in the market by forcing Android devices to pre-install certain apps including its own search tool. Under the settlement, Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications.  For smartphones already sold to Russian residents, Google will develop a pop-up window in the Chrome browser that allows users to change their default browser. The company has also agreed to create a tool that will allow Android device owners to set up a default search engine. The FAS Russia imposed a fine on Google for violating Article 10 of the Federal Law “On Protection of Competition” in the amount of 438 million rubles (US$7.8 million). This makes the applications pre-installation channel on mobile devices open for application developers who will get equal rights and opportunities to access the devices on the territory of the Russian Federation. Google spokesperson said in a statement, We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia’s competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android. Igor Artemiev, Head of the FAS Russia said, Implementation of the settlement’s terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications. We managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices.

Droid Life Menu Skip to content Home Topics Accessories Apps Beginners’ Guide Contests Deals News Polls Reviews Root Videos Podcast Deals Contact Search Post navigation Previous StoryThis is the HTC U by Kellex on Apr 17, 2017 @droid_life News Home Share this Story Fully Revamped “My Apps & Games” Google Play Section Seems to be Rolling Out Widely I’m not sure I can even recall when exactly this new Google Play Store “My apps & games” made its first appearance, but it feels like it has been popping up for months. Either way, Google must be ready to give it to everyone, as we’ve had a number of readers point out today that they are now seeing it. I’m also seeing it on my Moto G5 Plus. What’s new? You can see it, can’t you? Look at that new “Updates” tab, those “UPDATE” boxes, along with the update count, font size change, extra bits of info, option to sort your apps, and less bloated, card-tastic layout.  With this new layout, you can quickly update apps from a dedicated panel either individually without having to go into their app pages or still “Update all.” You can also see when an app was updated last and how big the app file is, open them from new “Open” boxes, and easily install old apps from your “Library” (formerly “All”). These might seem like pretty small changes, but they are soooo welcomed.   Everyone seeing this new layout on their devices? NOTE: If you kill your Google Play store or wipe its cache or even just back all of the way out, it should reload with the new setup. Cheers Mark, Bryce, and everyone else!

Let Us Know! Welcome to the roundup of the best new Android applications that went live in the Play Store or were spotted by us in the previous weeks or so. Please wait for this page to load in full in order to see the widgets, which include ratings and pricing info. Looking for the previous roundup editions? Find them here. Featured App Accu Battery Today's roundup is presented by Accu Battery from Digibites. Batteries today are ubiquitous with just about every device we use, as they play a critical role in our day-to-day that is difficult to dismiss. This means that it is pretty important to stay on top of your battery usage. Keeping track of what is using too much battery or just checking your current usage projections can be plenty helpful when out and about, as every spare milliamp-hour can be crucial in getting things done. Luckily Accu Battery is here to keep us informed, that way our batteries can run longer and more efficiently. -- Accu Battery protects battery health, displays battery usage information, and measures battery capacity (mAh) based on science. Batteries have a limited lifespan. Every time you charge your device, it wears out the battery, lowering its total capacity. Scientific research shows that battery lifespan can be extended up to 200%, when you charge your device to only 80%. Accu Battery measures the actual battery usage using information from the battery charge controller. Battery usage per app is determined by combining these measurements with information on which app is in the foreground. Android calculates battery usage using pre-baked profiles that device manufacturers provide, like how much power the CPU uses. In practice however, these numbers tend to be highly inaccurate. Measure real battery capacity (in mAh). Use the charge alarm to prolong battery lifespan. See how much wear your battery sustains with each charge session. Look up the discharge speed and battery consumption per app. Remaining charge time - know how long it takes before your battery is charged. Remaining use time - know when you will run out of battery. Screen on or screen off estimations. Check the percentage of deep sleep, when the device is in standby mode. Ongoing notification for real time battery statistics at a glance. Pro Features Real-time CPU and power usage overlay for spotting battery draining processes. Use Dark and AMOLED black themes to save energy. Access to historical sessions older than 1 day. Detailed battery statistics in notification.

The project is still in alpha, but everything appears to be in working order. There is even a pro version available for $1.99 that adds extra gesture controls. Looking at the design it is obviously built to match with the aesthetics you would find in the Google Pixel Launcher. Flick Launcher is completely free to install and there are no advertisements or in-app purchases in sight. -- Flick Launcher is a project started by Michele Lacorte (https://github.com/michelelacorte).

That way you are not limited by what Instagram does or doesn't allow for its uploads. InstaSwipe Instagram Panorama is easy to navigate and has a minimal yet intuitive user interface. This is free to download, though, it does contain advertisements. There are no in-app purchases to worry about but that also means you currently do not have a way to remove the ever-present ads. -- Ever wanted to display your gorgeous panoramic images but had to sacrifice the resolution to fit Instagram's size restrictions?

If an unlock attempt differs too much from your regular action, a second pin will then need to be entered in order to access the device. This ensures that no suspicious unlocks will ever happen. The Learning Lock is a completely free app. There are no advertisements or in-app purchases. -- Learning Lock is a lock screen that uses machine learning to detect anomalies in your pattern unlock and will ask for a back-up PIN if it thinks the attempt was suspicious. Download: The Learning Lock (Play Store) Pocket Sense Handheld devices that have a high cost often warrant a personal worry about pickpocketing. I know I have been in a few situations where it could be possible to easily snatch my device while I am not paying attention. Pocket Sense aims to be a tool that can help when you are in this position.

The first one is titled My Brothers Keeper and it is inspired by the PBS drama series Mercy Street. The second video, This Is Our Future, is a real-time interactive experience created by The Nature Conservancy and MPC. What is nice is that both of these videos can be viewed with or without a VR headset. Despite the Play Store mistakenly listing in-app purchases as available in TEC VR, it is actually a completely free app with no IAPs or advertisements. -- The Technicolor Experience Center is where artists and scientists from across the industry come together to realize the full potential of immersive media.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Some Google Wifis randomly stop working, turn solid blue Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Bug Watch Google Wifi News If your Google Wifi seems to be looking a bit blue these days — as in, the light is stuck blue — you might want to check to see if it's still actually functioning. The current build for it (9202.35.8) seems to be causing issues for some users. You probably know if you've been affected since, well, your Google Wifi won't be working. Other means of detection and confirmation manifest themselves via a steady blue light on the primary hub, at which point the satellite hubs may start to flash orange signifying a disconnect of the primary hub. In the meantime it seems that restarting that primary hub fixes the issue, but only temporarily. To be very clear, this is not a universal problem. It could be related to the latest build (9202.35.8). Even then, not all users are reporting this, and the precise nature of the cause has not been reported. But, a reasonably large number of individuals on Google's forums have been experiencing this particular issue. Google has responded on the forum with some information, reassurance, and instructions for those affected, saying, "Our team is still looking into this and working hard on getting a fix out-- we aim to have it out as soon as possible." More information for those who find they may be experiencing this problem is available below: The engineering team is still working on a final fix for this issue. However, over the past few days our support team has seen two workarounds that make help resolve the issue temporarily until the fix is released. These have worked in a few cases, and may be worth a try. 1. Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app. 2. Disconnect wireless Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices (or connect them via ethernet instead). There have been a few cases in which disconnecting any Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices has brought the Google Wifi network back up again without crashes. You can also reach out to our support team (g.co/wificare or wifica...@google.com), who will be able to provide more deep-dive troubleshooting advice based on the topography of your network. As always, thank you for your patience while we work on this issue. Both of the potential fixes at this time seem a bit unfortunate; neither having to switch to a new google account nor giving up using a Windows 10 device sound very great, but hopefully Google will have things solved quickly.

Ryne Hager Nah, bugs happen. All of the recent stuff has only really hit a small number of people. C Lo Perception is reality, even though it may only affect less than 1%. Sean Are the finger print readers messed up as well? Artem Russakovskii It also reboots at 30% battery. Josh Crumley Breaks SafetyNet too so no Android Pay dan And now it blueloops Jon Fridman #artemsluck Max Running that build on mine without issues. Artem Russakovskii Same here, because it's the latest current build - every Wifi should be on it right now. Kevin Davis Disconnect Windows & Xbox devices? GTFOH Google, fix your sh*t. enoch861 Haha, I'm so shocked that's actually a suggested fix I laughed out loud. It's like them saying "Don't use the internet and you won't have issues." This is why I stay away from a majority of Google hardware. 4Ui812 Google is aiming for continuity by breaking all of their products. berto1014 No kidding, sounds like their QA/QC lately is borderline nonexistent. TeutonJon78 Lately? It's been downhill since KK. whispy_snippet For goodness sake. Because WiFi wasn't already annoying enough. Leif Sikorski Service, testing and quality control ... something Google likes to fail at. They save money on the wrong end and that's why they'll never be a big competing hardware company. catalysto Apple products get bugs like this, too. dan At least when apple breaks something like fingerprint readers it's by design. MJ "Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app." WTF? A factory reset won't work but using a different Google account will? Does this concern anyone? There is ZERO reason to have a/your Google account tied to a piece of hardware like a router. This is your second warning. This was the first --> http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/23/google-onhub-wifi-units-randomly-dying-people-requiring-factory-resets/ 😆😄 Not concerning at all. The Google account just acts as the intermediary for the OAuth2 tokens that the app and the devices use to share data. Would you rather sign in with a login/pass every time you open the Google Wifi app instead? MJ Not concerning at all? We have already had one incident where the Google Accounts engine reset people's routers and another incident where using the original Google account that setup can't be used to fix a problem. Yes! I rather use a login/password local to router itself to logon. I have always owned my router and never had the need to use an "app" to access it. LOL The couple of times I need to change a setting on my router a year my PC is a better tool to do that. ericshmerick Bah, let MJ make everyone feel as if the sky is falling!!!11!11 4Ui812 Just " Google it " is said among people when they need information. When their phone or other hardware has issues people will start saying "it's Googled" . 4Ui812 Does Google search know what's wrong with Google's hardware/software or should people just Bing it ? Deeco Google has the worst quality control ever from why company. Ryan Moving the functionality to Google Express robertlwalters This killed my Asus OnHub AD1980 There's that high quality we've come to expect from Google products charles anderson I was doing some test on one of my onhubs earlier and once I reset it on this build that was it it would no longer work I couldn't reset it at all or reconnect to it it also wouldn't get an IP address from my ISP at all so there's that.🤔 sbeaulieu Fuck. Come on Google. Lare2 This is whats happens when Google wants to apply their philosophy of iterate fast to infrastructure equipment where you need rock solid stability. Get your act together Google, this is not a freaking gadget you can just push new stuff to it and wait to see what happens. Geeeez Bruce Wayne Very few things come out of this company that don't break down and have issues. They should focus on improving their current crop of products and services rather than rushing things out and implementing poor quality control.

Version 4.30’s chief new feature is turn-by-turn directions on the lock screen courtesy of a Directions widget. With that widget, users can arrow through each direction in any active route from the lock screen or the Today view (swipe left on the Home Screen). Users can also send their location via Google Maps through iMessage. Both features give Google Maps a dramatically more integrated experience in iOS, erasing some of the pain points of not being the built-in Maps service for Apple’s mobile operating system. The Directions widget will need to be added to your lock screen, while the location feature is available through iMessage. The update is free, meaning you remain the product.

The Noto serif CJK is the second such font to emerge from the Google/Adobe partnership, and it could have big implications for web designers the world over. Margaret Rhodes, staff writer for Wired magazine who covers design, reported on what makes the Noto serif CJK an accomplishment. She spoke with Marketplace host Kai Ryssdal about the font. An edited transcript of their conversation is below.  Kai Ryssdal: Google and Adobe worked together for years on this project. Why is a consistent font or typeset important to them? Margaret Rhodes: This is important to them because Google has an international audience. So does Adobe. And when you have an international audience, you have people who need to create products across different languages. Before this existed, the only option that you would have is if you want to make your magazine available for readers in another country, you have to choose a totally different typeface. And when you do that, you forfeit this look you've created. You wanted it to have a feel; you choose another typeface [and] it might lose that feel. Or, if you have a need to use different languages in one screen or on one product, they kind of get jumbled. And Bob Young at Google, he handles their internationalization efforts. He refers to that as the "ransom note effect." So, you know, that kind of schizophrenic, jumbled look. So you don't have that when you have access to fonts like these. So you have this fidelity across products. And then, you know, what is really cool is that as a designer or developer who, when you really care about your product, you get to show users in different countries that you are thinking of them. That you didn't just sort of, you know, convert something made for a Chinese audience to Korean. It's personal. Ryssdal: Right, it's respect for that audience. Well, and that actually gets to sort of an interesting part of this. We all know that Google is trying to take over the world, right? I mean, I say that tongue-in-cheek. But, I mean, that's kind of the mission right? The mission is, they want to categorize all the world's information and blah, blah, blah. It's interesting that this American company is now designing these fonts and typefaces for an Asian audience. Rhodes: Yes. Absolutely. There's a lot of people who want to access these products. And I think there's also a lot of people who use these different languages. And so being able to sort of, you know, bring them together visually is a pretty cool thing to be able to. Ryssdal: Is it hard to do this design work? I mean, it took years, right? And probably lots more people sitting in a room. Rhodes: Yeah. The reason that Google went to Adobe for these CJK — Chinese, Japanese, Korean scripts — it’s kind of due to this one guy, a linguist and a computer scientist who's been at Adobe for a while. His name is Ken Lunde. And he has been studying these letter forms for years. He told me that he got interested in the topic when he was studying Japanese [in] 1985. But over the course of all these years, he has written books on the topic of how you handle these East Asian languages on a computer. If you were to pull up a Word document and you were to type your name in three different fronts. And let's say you've got a lowercase 'e' in there. The curve in that 'e' could look different in each each version of your name. And that's because the designer specifically chose to make that curve look differently. And they do that across the entire font they design. So in Latin languages, there are 26 letters, and then there is a smattering of characters, numbers. But in Chinese, Japanese, Korean scripts, there are tens of thousands of characters. So that miniscule work that goes into making one 'e' look like that 'e,' you multiply that work times thousands.   Follow Kai Ryssdal at @kairyssdal.  Kai Ryssdal Kai Ryssdal is the host and senior editor of Marketplace, the most widely heard program on business and the economy — radio or television, commercial or public broadcasting — in the country.

AOSP site gets updated with Material Design, a better mobile view, and clearer navigation Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:31pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 Plus 1 on G+ 41 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares97 Android OS Design Development News Google has given its Android Open Source Project (AOSP) website a considerable makeover, making it much easier on the eye and much more user-friendly too. The update brings it in line with Google's own Material Design guidelines, improves the mobile view, and introduces new top-level tabs to improve navigation. Previous design: Out with the old This is the place to go for those who want to customize and port their own build of Android. As well as offering the Android source code itself, the website also contains vast amounts of instructional information. The overhaul has included a reorganization of content to allow for easier browsing and searching. Surprisingly, given the subject matter, the mobile browsing experience wasn't the friendliest before. Now, with a dedicated mobile view and responsive design, the site looks great on whichever device you choose to view it. Even on a desktop, it is much better looking, filling the full width of the screen and using larger, more legible type. The site's previous design had a decidedly Android 4.4 KitKat feel to it, so it's good to see it finally brought up to speed. The security section has also been pushed to the fore in the new navigation — according to Google, this mirrors its ever-increasing focus on keeping the Android platform safe going forward.

Averix Why would you waste time updating it then? LOL With the whole ecosystem, unless they make the apps cross compatible or a very clean cross compile and delivery system, it isn't changing anytime soon.

It's still yet to grow on me. Raphael Duran It's different but I kind of like it Carson Saldanha Would've been more consistent if they used pull to refresh, but of course, Google. lol Also, I wish they would add the "What's new" for apps in the "Updates" tab itself, so that way I don't have to always open the app page each time I want to see what's changed. Raphael Duran Yes, I wondered how didn't they use the pull down to refresh too but then I remembered it's a Google app and it all made sense Amir Arsyad What version are you on?

Like in Amazon Echo we just have to say "Alexa". David Hyman Microsoft just recently changed the Xbox commands from Xbox to Cortona. Not only is it worse than before but I constantly say the old keyword. The thing with ok google is that it never really comes up during a normal conversation where as Siri and Alexa sound more like other names and leaves to false keyword activation XerBlade Having "Xbox" as the hotword was pretty much the dumbest idea they could've possibly had. Unless you are a lonely warrior who only plays video games by himself all the time (as game developers seem to think all gamers are these days since hardly anyone who isn't Nintendo builds local multiplayer anymore...), it is extremely likely that the word "Xbox" is going to come up in normal conversation extremely often while you are using the Xbox with your friends or family. In fact, I know from experience that it happens constantly. David Hyman True but my point was about the issues with changing hotwords, and the fact that Cortona is worse than what they had before Jarrett Lennon Kaufman In what way is it worse? "Hey Cortana" works pretty well for me on my computer and Xbox with NO false positives like before. trickinit It doesn't work very well for me. It's a lot slower to respond and it tends to get the command wrong a lot more than it used to with "Xbox". Anytime Cortana doesn't understand me, it switches to the browser to do a Bing search. That get pretty frustrating when I'm trying to record a game clip. David Hyman Yea! Try having Cortona try to find a TV show, that used to be solid with the old way and completely fails now Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That doesn't sound like a problem with the command, necessarily, but the software change overall. David Hyman It seems like it always has to phone home for even the simplest commands like turn off. It seems to fail to understand that command very often lzdking I keep switching back to Cortona after system updates because I really want to use it, but the lag time is too much. Very annoying to tell Cortona to pause a show and then have it take anywhere from 3 - 8 seconds to pause. I switched back to the Xbox commands because they are nearly instant. David Hyman Dude that's definitely a major issue. I keep using it so they get more data to hopefully improve it. I like the media capabilities of my Xbox more than Chromecast because I get hdmi pass through for my Comcast box and it has Amazon video. Two things that I can't get with a Chromecast XerBlade I wasn't going to correct you if you only said it once, but it's "Cortana." David Hyman Oh sorry auto correct Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That would be terrible. The word "Google" comes up a lot in conversation in 2016. No way I'd want that alone to be the keyword in my living room. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] It's 'Ok Google'. Do you really say those two words together outside of voice recognition interactions? Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Did you bother to read the comment I was replying to? Damodara Kovie [dkovie] I feel a fool. My apologies, good sir. enoch861 At least those sound much much better than Ok, Google. catalysto Yes, "Alexa" is very easy to say and makes it feel like I'm talking to an actual person. "OK, Google" is awkward and alienating, at best. Matt Cortana is probably the best name actually. It's easy to say and is different enough that you shouldn't get a lot of false positives. I imagine Alexa could get annoying in households where someone is named Alexa, Alexis, possibly even Alex. wjrandon I'm tired of saying "ok google" as well. Marko Šaric Yeah. I wish that could be changed. At least "Hey Google!", as was shown at Google io. Lateef Alabi-Oki You can use "Hey Google" also. XerBlade At which point tech podcasters everywhere will have to find a new substitute phrase to use when they want to talk about it without activating the devices of everyone listening en masse. Lateef Alabi-Oki Hopefully, the voice training technology improves in these devices so that only registered voices can trigger the hotword. blassster And they need to tie the person's registered voice and query to the proper Google account. Custom hotwords per user would help. Lateef Alabi-Oki I believe Dieter Bohn said they were working on that in today's Verge podcast. If true, that'd be really neat. blassster I've never had this problem after they rolled out the training model part of the setup so long ago. XerBlade I never had that problem until they did that. Actually, they rolled out the training part of the setup alongside the "OK Google everywhere" feature. Neither existed before the other. So I highly doubt very many people had the issue BEFORE they rolled out the training model part of the setup, because they would literally have to be sitting either on the Google Now screen or (in the case of Nexus devices only at the time) on the home screen at the time when the hotword was heard, the chances of which are kinda low. blassster Oh, I thought the training model came later. I remember after training it (or, probably re-training it if you are correct) that it was solved. Early on for me it was the worst! youareme7 really? that's a Home thing I missed? I mean I want custom but at least hey google rolls off a little easier than ok google. Lateef Alabi-Oki I doubt they'd make it customizable since "Ok, Google" is free marketing and brand awareness for them. youareme7 Yeah, don't disagree but still a bummer, that syllable salad is a minor annoyance Lateef Alabi-Oki Yeah, I can see how it may be difficult to pronounce for non-English speakers. Maison Pulaski I doubt they would change the name of their flagship phone because _Nexus_ is free.... Oh wait.... Nevermind. Lateef Alabi-Oki You're right. This is Google we're talking about. We might wake up tomorrow and the hotword would be "Hey, Giri". By the way they're going to change the name of the Google Cast app to Google Home. Not confusing at all. Arthur J. hey google doesn't work Tuck Choate You don't have a Google home to test it on, yet, do you? Arthur J. I was speaking about Nexus Tuck Choate This discussion is about Google home. Arthur J. yeah, but why the command would be this on a device and that on another Tuck Choate It's primarily a voice device. AP even did an article on an APK breakdown on how they might give more control to users for voice actions. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/19/google-app-v6-3-suggests-google-assistant-may-launch-limited-language-support-expands-user-defined-actions-apk-teardown/ Arthur J. Forgot that one, that would so nice if they expand it to all devices. As Youareme7 said, 'OK' an extra syllable and "hey" would be more discreet. Especially when you say in English US in a non english country Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Yes, but more syllables was purposeful. More syllables makes it easier for the software to understand and gives you fewer false positives. Ryan Hey google works, I have one. Its not as reliable as OK google though. Lateef Alabi-Oki I believe "Hey, Google" worked in the demos. I may be wrong though, but I thought it did. Arthur J. I didn't payed attention to that Matt It just worked on my phone. 6p YaKillaCJ Just worked on my watch too. Hey Google is a lot more natural than ok Google. Still should be able to name your device. It's only natural since U can nickname/hotkey people. That way my Phone, Remote (older phone), Tablet, Watch, and now Home doesn't go off at once. drksilenc It does work i use it at home all the time. It doesnt work from cell phone which is done on purpose so you dont get multiple google devices activating at the same time. Justin W Hey Google works for me with my phone. Not sure if it's me just not saying it clearly enough or if it's actually a supported hotword though. Marko Šaric Works for me too (just tried it out). On my g watch and Nexus 5x. Cool. Markus Ressel Still kind of awkward imo dhamp2g Pretty silly reason to me, but to each his own. Marko Šaric Will Google Home work in Europe? (By Europe I mean Croatia). Lateef Alabi-Oki No, because the EU will find an excuse to sanction them for another monopoly abuse claim. Marko Šaric Seriously though. I was thinking about getting one. But I would like to know if I could actually use the thing and not just admire it. Lateef Alabi-Oki I think it's US only for now. It might come to Europe next year. They probably want to get multilingual issues sorted out first before they introduce it in Europe. Marko Šaric That's a bit disappointing if true. I would use it in English anyway. Lars Jeppesen Of course it will work if you import it. I'm planning to.. Marko Šaric I'm planning to also. However, I would like to not pay 3 times the price after shipping and taxes. Any tips for import sites where you may have purchased items previously. I've never imported from the states, as I merely use Amazon.de or UK. Lars Jeppesen Why would you think that? You think it checks your location and refuses to work if outside the US? Lateef Alabi-Oki Nope. I'm just speculating. I could competely wrong. Gregory It might not be sold in Europe, but will it work in Europe? I also don't mind using it in English. Matt I want to know this too. I might get my US friend to bring one with him in December to the UK, if it's going to work that is. Lateef Alabi-Oki If Google Assistant works in Europe, and I believe it does, I see no reason why Google Home wouldn't. I doubt Google would deliberately region lock Home. Jens Törnblad It doesn't work with Android TV? RedPandaAlex I'm pretty sure they confirmed that it will worth with Android TV using the Google Cast feature. Lateef Alabi-Oki It works with any Google Cast enabled device, including Android TV. Christofftofferson I assumed it would as android tv is a Chromecast receiver. komal You have a nice post and i liked very much http://www.printablecalendar2017.us/2016/07/march-2017-calendar.html XerBlade It will cast to an Android TV device, yes, but you can't use it (yet) to control the Android TV interface with voice commands like you can with one of the Android TV voice remotes. So it's kinda halfway supported. 2×4 Missing: - 8tracks? - TP-Link Kasa? - Ecobee? Lazy Tango All my standing lights are connected through TP-Link Kasa... Partially because Alexa connects to it, but mostly because I can't afford Hue lights. 2×4 in my case, I use Kasa because solutions that require a hub haven't worked reliably enough for me. CUEBALL Same here. Hope Kasa integrates with Home in the near future. Kevin Sauer No Ecobee? No Caseta Wireless Lutron? The smarthome space is so annoying right now. "Buy this thing! It may work with some other stuff. I dunno. Good luck." wjrandon "Ok Google, start the Rooma"? Kevin Sauer Sure that sounds good Philip Worthington Maybe, although I suspect what you got would be closer to this... https://youtu.be/g8v6cZ21vlc thomasguide2 Shouldn't the roomba be starting by itself? Phoenix I see what you did there Fatty Bunter You can do this with a Harmony Hub and IFTTT right now by issuing the appropriate IR command for a given voice keyword. Obviously that requires more $, but hey it's possible. enoch861 This is why you just buy the Echo. It works with mostly everything. catalysto Yeah, except the Amazon ecosystem is nowhere near as robust as Google's (e.g., Calendar, Maps, et cetera). Amazon has the upper hand on hardware integration at the moment, but I have no doubt that Google will quickly catch up -- especially with this fairly impressive launch list (remember Echo launched with none). Matt Maps "Ok Google, Navigate to the store." "You're in your house dumbfuck, but here's a map to the store on your TV." catalysto So... What exactly is your point? You know Alexa doesn't have this information, right? Cory S it actually can do all those things. Albeit badly, but it does. cabbieBot best comment on AP possibly ever. Brandon V. Fletcher Echo's support grew over time. So will Google Home's. Hector Diaz I have 3 echo so with Smartthings. Really like it but echo is not that smart. shadowdude777 It really bugs me that Play Music doesn't work with the Echo. And this is ALL GOOGLE'S FAULT. If they would just expose an API like Spotify does, we could have support for Play Music everywhere that we have Spotify. I'd ditch Play Music today, because Spotify has a better desktop client, better social features, an app that isn't a lagfest, and better family pricing now, but I'd lose out on Play Music's ability to upload my own tracks, which is sadly quite important to me. :( Cory S Amazon blocks Chromecast products from even being sold on their store, and you think they would work well with Google on this? BRB I need to get back to watch Prime video on my TV....oh wait its Android TV and I cant because actively AMAZON BLOCKS IT. shadowdude777 Amazon doesn't have to do ANYTHING if Google didn't provide such a bad service with a locked-down API; that's the point. If there were a Play Music API, a third-party dev could write the Echo Skill that integrates with it, with no work on Amazon's part. All of these walled gardens are infuriating; Google needs to learn to play nice with other ecosystems. It would solve a lot of their problems if they just made it possible to integrate their services with other systems. Andy J Did you really just suggest that Google doesn't open up everything they can for developers? You have seen https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/ right? shadowdude777 You're joking, right? Are you really defending them and saying that "they're doing the best they can"? If they were opening up everything they can for developers, why is there no music API? Spotify has one. Why is there no Hangouts API? Why is there no Allo API? These are all services that NEED APIs to be taken seriously. Give me one good reason why they can't expose an API for these services. Andy J OK - well..... Hangouts & Allo = proprietary, just like WhatsApp doesn't have an API, Facebook messenger doesn't have an API. The music service doesn't have an API for any number of reasons ranging from - they don't want to expose the service via an API to - the contracts they have agreed with the studios and labels may well disallow it, don't make the mistake that all the music services have identical agreements with the labels because that is far from the case. Finally - don't fall in to the trap that every service under the sun should/does have an API - Netflix doesn't provide an API allowing you to consume their paid for content outside of the Netflix ecosystem. Amazon TV doesn't have an API allowing you to consume their video content outside of their service. shadowdude777 Google Talk used standards (XMPP) while Hangouts doesn't, and Allo doesn't. Yes, other walled gardens also don't provide APIs, but you shouldn't pretend that Google is some bastion of developer/consumer-friendliness when they're just as bad as every other company that thinks they're above playing nice with others. Slack has an API, Discord has an API, Telegram has an API etc. There's no way that Google was able to negotiate an agreement allowing for a feature like users uploading their own songs to Play Music, but not negotiate an agreement allowing for API access for premium members like Spotify has. This is a decision they made, considering they obviously have the pull to make an API happen if they actually cared. Yes, video streaming services don't provide APIs, and I'm not asking for Google to open up a Play Movies streaming API. But Play Music has no reason not to have one, nor do Google's multiple failing messenger apps. Andy J "Yes, video streaming services don't provide APIs, and I'm not asking for Google to open up a Play Movies streaming API." This is my point - why? Why aren't you asking for that? Your entire argument is that Google don't have enough APIs - why stop at demanding Play Music? I'm not saying Google should not open up an Play Music API - there is obviously something because there are unofficial apps that use an undocumented API - but why do you think it would be OK to not open up a video streaming API too - after all - YouTube has one, why shouldn't Play Movies - especially considering it uses YouTube on the backend anyway. Josh Hoffman How is the Spotify family pricing better than Google All Access? Play music 6 users for 14.99 plus Youtube Red. Spotify is 14.99 for 6 users but spotify only. shadowdude777 Didn't realize it was you + 5 people for Play Music, I thought it was 5 people total (so you + 4 people). Yeah, I guess GPM's pricing is better. Pranav Check IFTTT, they have a lot of connections that solve this issue Savage Alien Ecobee commands are HomeKit based. atlharry Not just HomeKit. Smartthings works as well so you could get to the Ecobee through Smartthings. Savage Alien Oh, okay. Thanks for clarifying that. youareme7 These are just the launch (pre-launch?) partners, it'll expand exponentially when they open it up in December. I use Wink for instance and I know they're working on it but weren't a "launch partner". dhamp2g They have some big ones on the list. It works with chrome cast, text , and Play music.....I'm in Lars Jeppesen Never heard of those products.... Ryan IFTTT gives you control over all of that. The setup kind of sucks, Ill admit, but the plus side you can customize the phrases that trigger things to something that is more "human" or fun. Kevin Sauer Thanks for your reply. I have already done all of that through IFTTT, but as you point out, it's a pain in the ass. I would prefer the manufacturers bake it into their product directly. YaKillaCJ @Ryan I did the same here. I just setup a lot using IFTTT, Pushbullet & Tasker. Sure U have to manually make the word commands but it works. Nothing like saying "Hey Google" and control nearly everything. Ryan Yeah, its definitely tedious. But odds are I will keep doing it after makers like Wemo and Lutron plug in because, what I have seen so far with 3rd party services, their actions are really limited. While I had to set it up its nice to be able to say "Hey Google, start a fire" to have it turn on my fireplace instead of something more literal. BAlGaInTl I paired mine with a Samsung SmartThings hub that was on sale for $50. I can control my Ecobee seamlessly through that. I don't think there is Lutron support yet though. MicroNix This is why Echo > Google Home right now and probably for some time. Android sites are hyping Google Home like its some great thing. It barely works with anything in a smart home right now. Let's revisit in a year or so. Until then, umm, no thanks. Ethan Campbell I'm interested in the Software. I was a Quora power user, and I'm on hiatus right now. When I return, I will be using the Google Home with it all the time. Gregg Long I hope Caseta comes through soon. A much better solution for lights that aren't table lamps. Gregg Long Yes much better - and they still offer a wall wart plug in for table lamps. And unlike solutions like Hue, you can use a caseta wall switch which works with regular decora plates to turn on and off the lights while still having retaining control through your app. With Wifi lights, when you turn them off at the switch your remote control turns off with them. eazyean1 Sonos? Lateef Alabi-Oki If you can connect the Audio Chromecast to Sonos, it might be able to work. I don't have a Sonos, but I heard someone talk about it on an IOT podcast yesterday. Christofftofferson Most of the sonos speakers don't have audio in jacks (only the play 5 does). Sonos does accept google cast from Google play if you have sonos on the android phone you're casting from. Also they annouced they're working with Alexa to get voice control in 2017... so hopefully they remain fairly agnostic between Google, Amazon and others. Lateef Alabi-Oki Honestly, I see no reason why Sonos can't write some actions for Google Assistant and Google Home. They'd be foolish not to, since it looks like Google wants Assistant and Home to be an open platform for developers. op12 They're definitely thinking about it, but who knows how long it'll be considering the Amazon Alexa integration took months... https://twitter.com/JohnLMacFarlane/status/733013734625415168 Benoit Bourdua Plex seems like something people would want to see there. Corbin Davenport If it had Plex support, at least for audio, I would buy one. Benoit Bourdua I play my music using Plex on Synology + Chromecast Audio. Not sure I'll buy one, but if there is no support for that combo it's a sure thing I won't. MicroNix Synology, what a great NAS. Worth every penny. Blake Mitchell I'm starting to regret getting a QNAP. komal You have a nice thought and very creative and awesome http://www.printablecalendar2017.us/2016/07/february-2017-calendar.html Soundjudgment Plex just finished its app update-release for iOS and iPhone/iPad. Google Home should be next. Morten Ulv Not before December when Actions on Google comes. Mike Marshall Senior director of Yahoo!, is telling visitors to start off "Work at home" practice, that People have been doing for more than a year now. This season only, I generated about $36k already with nothing but my laptop or computer as well as some leisure time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to five job. Even most people new at all to this, can make $50/per h undoubtedly and the income might be even very high in the long run... This is how i started >> http://adultadda.net/2Y3 Fatty Bunter WHAT ELSE DO YOU KNOW? TELL ME IMMEDIATELY. But seriously, this would be by far the biggest jump in capability for me and many others I know. Would love this so much, cant wait. Aaron Geier You can cast to the Google Home from the Plex app in Android. Chris McGrath they just released alexa support, i imagine google home isn't far behind it Mark555055 i would be shocked if Plex did not interface with Google home in the near future.

Was that a pun? SmashleyFC How does this differentiate accounts? Can anyone just add shit to my calendar? youareme7 as of today the best we know is it only supports one account. I'm guessing that'll change but who knows when Abhishek Saral Wait so if I am watching something on YouTube or listening to something on Spotify on an iPhone. And I say "Play this on my TV". Will it work? Even with an iPhone? Boolean Corporation Netflix or bust Angst They (At the event on October 4th) said that Netflix was already on-board with making integration in the 'very near' future JSo So anything that works with the Chromecast should work with the Nexus Player, right? João Dias So does this mean that Google keep is getting an api? :D Andrew Gallagher Any idea how it will work in a multiple Google account household? Andy J Yup....... until they implement something - you know - sensible.... currently you have to find out who is logged in, find them, ask them to log out (using their phone), log in and perform whatever it was you wanted to do (which you could of done 10 times over with just your phone by the time you get logged in to it). I wish they had resolved this issue BEFORE selling it.... scasmflop Video list seems a bit light... I would guess that Google Play Movies should be in there as well. I thought I remembered them calling up "Stranger Things" during the on stage demo to insinuate netflix also working in some capacity. Thomas Paulsen After the I/O event I was expecting that we would see some cunning home automation examples. Google is full of engineers that like to cook-up some awesome things. But we didn't see that. The only native home automation partner appears to be Nest. No word on the level of integration. Say an object moves into the Nest camera view. Let me see a live stream on my Android TV. Instead we are getting SmartThings support. SM had horrible latency at one point. So not only does my command have to go through Google but also through SM and back. Not to mention SM security concerns. No word on Brillo and Weave standards. Very concerning. I'd by a Google Home supported door lock right away. Smart door locks have been a disappointment so far actually. Defenestratus Smart things no longer has horrible latency. surethom Hopefully by the time Google Home comes to the UK next Summer or later, I hope Wemo & lifx are supported, & also able to select Hot word, even Hey Google is better than Ok Google. trent Why no voice calls over hangouts. Seems like a perfect use case. Oh right ... Hangouts is now a class B deprecated product! sasidhar79 any chance of Google Assistant becoming available for devices other than Pixel? Lars Jeppesen Allo MrCalifornia I wonder if there will be two user support. Would be awesome if it could recognize the difference between my wife and I and let us use different calendars, etc. steelew Whose user account does it use? In a house with 4 people, separation is a must. They haven't made any mention of it, so I'm guessing it's just one account. Andy J yup (at a time). Andy J I hope to see Logitech Media Center on here - it already supports Chromecasts so I expect they will do something..... Defenestratus I use a harmony hub through smartThings which is integrated with Home so I can control my heat pumps. Greg DePasse I (and 100's of others - https://goo.gl/KVWzkI) would like to know if Google Home (and Assistant for that matter) will work with GSuite accounts (the new Google Apps for Domain/Work etc). Assistant currently access personal details in Allo for instance, so it's not promising for those of us that pay for GSuite accounts for our families. mcdonsco Hopefully Google doesn't pull an Amazon and exclude ecobee because of nest; so far it looks that way :-/ Dn Bro I think you could try using ifttt Đức Thành Would love to see some good podcast apps on that list. TuneIn is "Meh". Beast TuneIn is great for internet radio, I use it all the time :) Đức Thành I used to use TuneIn frequently, but then Pocket Casts happened. It's not perfect but it offers a significantly better experience. You should give it a try. Defenestratus Google Play Music does podcasts. Đức Thành I'm aware, but it does not in my country. xanok No Ecobee? doom Alexa can turn the temperature up or down on a Nest but can't turn the heat or cool on if it is set to off. If Google Home can do that, I'll switch right away. Beast I expect since Google bought Nest they will have full app integration as part of Google Home :) Emanuele Ricci I would really love to see an integration with Netatmo. Do you know if Google home has open APIs so I will be able to develop by my self an integration?

I have a TP-Link, which works fine with their app, but I've been holding off on buying anything more until I know it's compatible with Google Home. Having to unlock my phone, open the app, and then change the lights is too many steps for me to do with a smart device like lights. dhamp2g People are All these services with with very small followings when compared to google Eco system many of which who have never heard of in the general from non tech community this is aimed at the general population bill875 Support for Insteon would be nice. I have SmartThings as well for my Schlage locks, but Insteon controls some of the lighting in my house. DongoDongo Not trying to be negative but, can someone remind me why you need to "aumotate" your home, especially by voice? I can probably toggle the switch more than 10 times before you're done with a voice command. Adam Margeson Are you asking about reality, or what they're trying to sell me? They're selling me the ability to turn on/off the lights from the couch without having to get up. Not having to get up is not worth my health or however much they want for this and a couple of "smart lights". Beast Or in fact the total home automation, i.e. when you leave the house the lights turn off, when you come back they turn on, music can start to play when you come home, etc, etc. It isn't about convenience, it is about a new technological era.... :) Marko Šaric Is this an intentional oversimplification? Adam Margeson A little bit. I use Tasker to do all sorts of little automations of settings or interactions on my phone. But I'm not the average person - I like taking time to tweak and program things to make future interaction easier for myself. Most people aren't that enthusiastic about programming automation or will get frustrated with setting up rules that fit most situations properly. Example: "Arm my alarm system when I leave the house" -> the wife is still home when you walk out, the system still arms itself. "Do what I mean, not what I say," is something that comes to mind for how users want automation to work. When computer AI and sensing technology get to a much better state, we might be able to do that, but right now, proper automation takes a *lot* of patience to set up. Marko Šaric Fair enough. Defenestratus Because I can turn lights on and off without leaving my chair. For example, I Just told my Google Home "Hey Google turn on the christmas tree" and voila, its on. Its equally as useful when you want to turn on a whole room full of lights at the same time. in my Kitchen I have four different light switches that I'd need to tap in order to turn on all the lights. Instead I just say "Ok Google turn on all the kitchen lights" and bam. On. Likewise its great for dimming them. "Hey google dim the kitchen lights to 25%" Letting the dog out the back door, I go "OK google, turn on all the outside lights" turns on all of the fixtures outside. Now that I've lived with it for a few months, I don't know how I lived without it. (I have all of my switches linked through SmartThings) Leonardo Baez You don't "need" Its an option. Think of that disabled people who can switch lights, set temperature o turn on a tv just with their voice Tucker Sferro how convenient for Google that my Nexus 6 Google now voice activation from any screen is no longer available!! it visibly toggles itself off in settings, and other Nexus 6 owners have had the same issue for quite some time now. Beast Would be nice to get Hive integration, proper Cast to Sonos would be the selling point for me. Angus Marshall Your list is out of date already... Gerardo Sarabia Now if only they unified Assistant on Home and the Pixel... not gonna happen. Gotta keep things as inconsistent as possible, because Google. ChilZeg what kind of unification are you thinking??? Gerardo Sarabia Having the option of controlling other devices (chromecast, chromecast audio or chromecast built-in devices, for example) with Assistant on Pixel. Stenso Has anyone figured out how to use Reminders? "Okay Google, remind me to take the dog out?" "Okay, when would you like to be reminded? Say a place or time." "When I arrive home." "Your reminder has been set." Jon Fridman You can't use reminders via Google Home yet. I'm sure it's being worked on for a future release, or at least I hope so. Stenso This really disappointed me. I just kind of assumed this would work since it has Keep and Calendar hooks. It was a big reason I jumped ship from Echo. Fingers crossed it makes it in soon. Jon Fridman Due to an NDA I can't really comment on what Google is planning for the home in that regard. I have high hopes for my Google home and it's future abilities. BierKerl Doesn't your dog remind you to take it out quite aggressively when you get home? ;-) Leonardo Baez Lol 😂 Alec M Mine has serious issues streaming Netflix on my Asus Nexus Player. Has anyone else had the same experience with maybe a Roku or something similar? madmaglio Works fine with my gen 1 chromecast. The Home just start the stream. It's the device that would be having the issue. Alec M Yeah, I have some friends that have the small chromecasts and they work fine. I have a feeling that the issue is having a device that has Netflix as a standalone app installed. Bill Anderson Shouldn't Android TV be on this list? I know it's kind of covered by Chromecast, but then it wasn't supported until a day ago. Garrett Penfield Mine STILL doesn't work with Spotify... mrlex You spelt Philips wrong (only one l) YaKillaCJ Enabling IFTTT was a big 1. Thru this I am able to use Google Home to control Hook Automation which controls any RF device. It's making me spoiled. Vladimir Only Murica. Right? Any rumors when should it come overseas? Adam Carl Aren't you forgetting Uber? I can link my Uber account to my home Abhinav You can ask question on Quora too. JG Is there a way to get it to prefer one service over another? I haven't linked Netflix to the account the Home in the living room is connected to. Yet when I asked it to play "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" it only looks on Netflix for it. It use to have no problem pulling the album from Google Play Music (which is linked to the account). [The album BTW is basically an audio book if you don't have any video casting devices online] I got it to work after specifying GPM, but that's a bit of a mouth full. And since there is me Netflix account linked to it... Shouldn't it attempt to use an it has access to first? madmaglio I think if you say "listen to..." i think it will assume its music and not the film and use Play Music. Gregg Long There is a serious bug going on with Nest Thermostats. The Google Home can't find it - keeps saying it's unavailable. Even though Google Now can control it fine when you are out of the house. shayden Google home + Smartthings + Harmony Hub + IFTT for custom commands is all the home control I could ever want. I have an HDMI matrix and 4 TVs. I can just say "ok google set the secondary TV to Xbox" or "ok google set the sound to chromecast". And of course I can control all the lighting with my voice. And the one thing for me that puts google home far above the echo is my ability to play whole home audio with google home and chromecast audios. "ok google play my favorite music on first floor". Boom, done. PerhapsNever Ooooohhhh!!! How are you doing the input commands? I've been DYING to figure out how to expose actual Harmony controls to my GH. My setup is 3 Harmony Hubs, ST, Hue lights, and IFTTT. shayden You use IFTTT to bridge the home and the hub. The catch is whatever command you are trying to accomplish with the harmony hub has to be an activity. so I have made a ton of different activities just to do simple things like switch inputs or adjust volume. You setup IFTTT using google assistant as the "if". You can choose whatever activation command you want and can also put in different ways of saying it as well as a custom response back from the google home. you make the "then" the harmony activity that you want to run once the custom command is heard. PerhapsNever Ahhhh, gotcha. I only have about 5 activities on each of my hubs, but I never thought about making activities for a single action. GENIUS! Thanks for the reply! shayden I recommend using the desktop app vs the phone app when setting up all the activities. much easier and quicker to work with a mouse and keyboard. NoConcussion The Google Home app has been updated to include more than 50 "service" apps. Too many to list and probably memorize. Apps like games, psychotherapist, search capability, local events, social media, language training, news trends, pizza ordering, personal trainer and more. abc I'll check out Home in a few years. Let the fanboys do the full-retail price beta testing. dhamp2g Love to. Vandale Gentry You can order Domino's pizza from the Google Home! PorchSong BTW, it's "Continually" updated, not "continuously." But thank you for maintaining this list. Emanuele Ricci Still waiting for Netatmo :'( Abdulgader Badkook You forgot to mention akinator. It is available by saying "let me speak to akinator" Shahul Hameed Akbar Why isn't Shield not listed in streaming devices? I am able to cast music and YT videos from Google Home to it since December. Kevin Brosseau So the New Shield is not supported yet with casting Netflix to the box? Ruperto17 Netflix does not work with Google TV, only Chromecast at the moment. Google Home will tell me if I try to send anything to my Nexus Player. pookietookie Google Home can set calendar reminders now? dcdttu Do the Honeywell thermostats require SmartThings? (As in, are they Z-Wave?) If so, should they be a subset of SmartThings? If not, nvrmnd. Artem Russakovskii No, they're just Wi-Fi, like Nest. dcdttu Well that makes sense then. :-) Now I'm just waiting patiently for Wink to get the green light. Roy So am I missing something or is Android TV seriously not supported? Kostas 💪🎩 It's Bang & Olufsen James Ogle You've added Belkin Wemo, but it doesn't support their lightbulbs. Only their switches and power outlets. I've tried it, it doesn't recognise the Wemo Link hub or anything connected to it. bigwill_420 I see they didn't bother putting nvidia shield tv on the list. 😢 Leonardo Baez How do I use the services? mustbepbs Still can't add time to an existing timer. keithzg Remains only available in the US and UK. Dammit, Google, Canada is right here, on the same continent, and if you were worried about the spelling of "colour" on the packaging or something then you've already handled that with the UK, so what's the delay? iantrich You're missing quite a few services and iHeartRadio is already integrated Anthony Chandler Any word on Sonos integration? I get that they're competitors w/ Chromecast Audio, but I've heard that Sonos is looking for tighter integration with popular services... AlRegals I really need Hulu to start working with Google Home.

Some Google Wifis randomly stop working, turn solid blue Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Bug Watch Google Wifi News If your Google Wifi seems to be looking a bit blue these days — as in, the light is stuck blue — you might want to check to see if it's still actually functioning. The current build for it (9202.35.8) seems to be causing issues for some users. You probably know if you've been affected since, well, your Google Wifi won't be working. Other means of detection and confirmation manifest themselves via a steady blue light on the primary hub, at which point the satellite hubs may start to flash orange signifying a disconnect of the primary hub. In the meantime it seems that restarting that primary hub fixes the issue, but only temporarily. To be very clear, this is not a universal problem. It could be related to the latest build (9202.35.8). Even then, not all users are reporting this, and the precise nature of the cause has not been reported. But, a reasonably large number of individuals on Google's forums have been experiencing this particular issue. Google has responded on the forum with some information, reassurance, and instructions for those affected, saying, "Our team is still looking into this and working hard on getting a fix out-- we aim to have it out as soon as possible." More information for those who find they may be experiencing this problem is available below: The engineering team is still working on a final fix for this issue. However, over the past few days our support team has seen two workarounds that make help resolve the issue temporarily until the fix is released. These have worked in a few cases, and may be worth a try. 1. Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app. 2. Disconnect wireless Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices (or connect them via ethernet instead). There have been a few cases in which disconnecting any Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices has brought the Google Wifi network back up again without crashes. You can also reach out to our support team (g.co/wificare or wifica...@google.com), who will be able to provide more deep-dive troubleshooting advice based on the topography of your network. As always, thank you for your patience while we work on this issue. Both of the potential fixes at this time seem a bit unfortunate; neither having to switch to a new google account nor giving up using a Windows 10 device sound very great, but hopefully Google will have things solved quickly.

Josh Crumley Breaks SafetyNet too so no Android Pay dan And now it blueloops Jon Fridman #artemsluck Max Running that build on mine without issues. Artem Russakovskii Same here, because it's the latest current build - every Wifi should be on it right now. Kevin Davis Disconnect Windows & Xbox devices? GTFOH Google, fix your sh*t. enoch861 Haha, I'm so shocked that's actually a suggested fix I laughed out loud. It's like them saying "Don't use the internet and you won't have issues." This is why I stay away from a majority of Google hardware. 4Ui812 Google is aiming for continuity by breaking all of their products. berto1014 No kidding, sounds like their QA/QC lately is borderline nonexistent. TeutonJon78 Lately? It's been downhill since KK. whispy_snippet For goodness sake. Because WiFi wasn't already annoying enough. Leif Sikorski Service, testing and quality control ... something Google likes to fail at. They save money on the wrong end and that's why they'll never be a big competing hardware company. catalysto Apple products get bugs like this, too. dan At least when apple breaks something like fingerprint readers it's by design. MJ "Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app." WTF? A factory reset won't work but using a different Google account will? Does this concern anyone? There is ZERO reason to have a/your Google account tied to a piece of hardware like a router. This is your second warning. This was the first --> http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/23/google-onhub-wifi-units-randomly-dying-people-requiring-factory-resets/ 😆😄 Not concerning at all. The Google account just acts as the intermediary for the OAuth2 tokens that the app and the devices use to share data. Would you rather sign in with a login/pass every time you open the Google Wifi app instead? MJ Not concerning at all? We have already had one incident where the Google Accounts engine reset people's routers and another incident where using the original Google account that setup can't be used to fix a problem. Yes! I rather use a login/password local to router itself to logon. I have always owned my router and never had the need to use an "app" to access it. LOL The couple of times I need to change a setting on my router a year my PC is a better tool to do that. ericshmerick Bah, let MJ make everyone feel as if the sky is falling!!!11!11 4Ui812 Just " Google it " is said among people when they need information. When their phone or other hardware has issues people will start saying "it's Googled" . 4Ui812 Does Google search know what's wrong with Google's hardware/software or should people just Bing it ? Deeco Google has the worst quality control ever from why company. Ryan Moving the functionality to Google Express robertlwalters This killed my Asus OnHub AD1980 There's that high quality we've come to expect from Google products charles anderson I was doing some test on one of my onhubs earlier and once I reset it on this build that was it it would no longer work I couldn't reset it at all or reconnect to it it also wouldn't get an IP address from my ISP at all so there's that.🤔 sbeaulieu Fuck. Come on Google. Lare2 This is whats happens when Google wants to apply their philosophy of iterate fast to infrastructure equipment where you need rock solid stability. Get your act together Google, this is not a freaking gadget you can just push new stuff to it and wait to see what happens. Geeeez Bruce Wayne Very few things come out of this company that don't break down and have issues. They should focus on improving their current crop of products and services rather than rushing things out and implementing poor quality control.

The Doodle depicts Ocloo "empowering the women of Ghana with the tools to improve their lives and communities," said Google. April 18 would have been her 98th birthday. According to Google, "Auntie Ocloo" had just six shillings — less than one dollar — when she began making and selling marmalade as a young woman in the 1930s. After eventually securing a loan, she grew her business and traveled to the U.K. to learn more about food processing. On her return, she shared with other Ghanaian women the technical knowledge and skills of how to start and run a business. Due to her success she was invited to the first U.N. World Conference on Women in 1975. Throughout her life, Ocloo helped improve women's lives in Ghana and advocated for their success in business. She saw the importance of credit in helping women achieve better health and prosperity, but poor black women were often ignored by the banks. So she helped establish Women's World Banking, a global nonprofit that provided low-income women with microloans to help start their own businesses.

Google announced at the beginning of December it would enable developers to access about 30 GB of certain materials – videos, software development kits (SDKs), documents and more – offline through DVDs and thumb drives. Targeted at “software developers or students of software development in regions of the world where steady access to the internet is expensive, unreliable or non-existent”, Google has already spread upward of 2000 kits across India, Bangladesh and Sub-Saharan Africa, the company said. With blackouts and internet outages a common trope in Myanmar, the country seems a prime candidate for the program. But a kit hasn’t come its way just yet. Ko Ye Lin Aung, Google Developer Group Yangon community manager, said the corporation has been busy with the holidays and filling far-reaching orders. So he and friends took matters into their own hands. Instead of waiting for the postman, they decided to work around a workaround and download and disseminate the information themselves. “We put it on memory sticks and then we distributed it,” he said. “Even in our offices, the internet is slow most of the time and fast like one hour a day ... and some of the time, there is no internet at all,” he continued. “[With] offline content ... we don’t have to wait for the internet.” Ko Ye Lin Aung and his friends put the contents of the kits on sticks and dispatched them to campuses around Myanmar. Delivery took a more circuitous route than usual, as the resources made their way by physical roads rather than the information superhighway. “I just sent the memory stick with an express bus,” Ko Ye Lin Aung said. “We’re sending the offline content with the offline process. That’s the traditional way.” Though winding, it’s a path people will find familiar as the web has yet to trump offline measures in some other industries. “If you want to send money, there is no online banking,” he continued. “You just send [with] people or banks or something like that.” Ko Ye Lin Aung said about 15 people have requested the offline content – most of which he has already sent. Items on the DVDs and thumb drives include Google Cloud Platform documents with SDKs for App Engine, the whole Android website with Android SDKs and more, documents on material design and web fundamentals, Udacity online learning videos and other content, the company said. Google also suggests kit users put the content to good use, highlighting hackathons, viewing parties and self-study. “You will no longer have to worry about ... spending 30 minutes to watch a 10-minute video tutorial on the latest API due to constant buffering,” the company said in a post on the Google Developers Blog. Crucially, the kits provide developers what they need to begin manufacturing apps: SDKs. “If I want to make an Android app, I need the Google SDK,” Ko Ye Lin Aung said, adding that materials in the software kit mean developers don’t have to start from square one. “If you don’t have the SDK, you cannot do anything.” While helpful, offline content can’t compete with real-time aspects of the internet. The kits are up-to-date as of August 2014, the company said – any updates past that time won’t be incorporated. Though not the be-all, end-all, “it’s a point where you can get started,” Ko Ye Lin Aung said. “After that, we have to move on to update the stuff and you can continue because you already know how [stuff] works.” Despite limits, Ko Ye Lin Aung said people are enthusiastic and excited. “They need a starting point and they need the stuff, so we gave [it to them],” he said. “We told them, ‘It’s all your own. Take your time and learn whatever you want with the stuff, build stuff and if you need anything, just tell us. We will support you but we might not be able to tell you the whole thing.’” Most Read - Business Delays in bus system reform mean new routes but old vehicles Speculators could stall investment, says minister MOGE to invite offshore supply base bids JICA to publish amended master plan by year-end Tax laws aimed at improving income transparency Bangkok Bank and ICBC cleared to open on June 2 Central Bank to limit payments to only the kyat Pepsi to use Shan State spuds in its Thai chips Local firm plans Daewoo bus factory in Yangon Ministry targets ‘investor-friendly’ changes to law Most Read - Technology MPT doubles subscribers in past year Ooredoo announces local distributors Text 133 for internet Telcos to collect 5 percent tax MySquar rolls out new messenger app Men more likely than women to own mobile phones: report Google search now finds phones Barriers remain to technology revolution: MCRB Mytel to target rural areas and compete on price MIH to bring Thai-speed broadband to Myanmar Latest Technology News Only a week left to register SIM Mytel to target rural areas and compete on price Myanmar’s fourth telco gets licence at last Farmers reap rewards from 3D printing Fourth telco hoping to get licence for Christmas Too perfect?

The Week in Reading for April 18, 2017. Chelsea Hassler At the beginning of every month, the internet is flooded with lists of must-reads for the coming 28 to 31 days. And while it's easy to find books that look intriguing at the start of the month, it's a whole lot less so to remember those books when you're actually looking for something new to read. But we're on a mission to change that—and just in time to eke out that same-day delivery from Amazon. Here, without further ado: the eight best books with a release date of April 18, 2017. "Imagine Wanting Only This" by Kristen Radtke. Amazon Imagine Wanting Only This by Kristen Radtke Pantheon Graphic Novels, 288 pages The most beautiful graphic novel you’ll read all year, Kristen Radtke’s memoir is an absolutely stunning look at what it is to recover from grief, and is so haunting you’ll be thinking about it for days after reading it.  Where you've heard her name before: She’s a writer and illustrator. Goodreads synopsis: When Kristen Radtke was in college, the sudden death of a beloved uncle and the sight of an abandoned mining town after his funeral marked the beginning moments of a lifelong fascination with ruins and with people and places left behind. Over time, this fascination deepened until it triggered a journey around the world in search of ruined places. Now, in this genre-smashing graphic memoir, she leads us through deserted cities in the American Midwest, an Icelandic town buried in volcanic ash, islands in the Philippines, New York City, and the delicate passageways of the human heart. Along the way, we learn about her family and a rare genetic heart disease that has been passed down through generations, and revisit tragic events in America's past. At once narrative and factual, historical and personal, Radtke's stunning illustrations and piercing text never shy away from the big questions: Why are we here, and what will we leave behind?  "The Book of Joan" by Lidia Yuknavitch. Amazon The Book of Joan by Lidia Yuknavitch Harper, 288 pages While delivering an entirely new world and also putting forth a powerful treatise on the way we live now, The Book of Joan is one of those dystopian novels that you can’t help thinking might be too eerily real to be just fiction. Where you've heard her name before: She’s the author of The Small Backs of Children and The Chronology of Water.  Goodreads synopsis: In the near future, world wars have transformed the earth into a battleground. Fleeing the unending violence and the planet’s now-radioactive surface, humans have regrouped to a mysterious platform known as CIEL, hovering over their erstwhile home. The changed world has turned evolution on its head: the surviving humans have become sexless, hairless pale-white creatures floating in isolation, inscribing stories upon their skin. Out of the ranks of the endless wars rises Jean de Men, a charismatic and bloodthirsty cult leader who turns CIEL into a quasi-corporate police state. A group of rebels unite to dismantle his iron rule—galvanized by the heroic song of Joan, a child-warrior who possesses a mysterious force that lives within her and communes with the earth. When de Men and his armies turn Joan into a martyr, the consequences are astonishing. And no one—not the rebels, Jean de Men, or even Joan herself—can foresee the way her story and unique gift will forge the destiny of an entire world for generations. "The Age of Inequality: Corporate America's War on Working People" edited by Jeremy Gantz. Amazon The Age of Inequality: Corporate America's War on Working People edited by Jeremy Gantz Verso, 272 pages If there’s one thing we know, it’s that history repeats itself—and here, in these collected works of the past 40 years, the magazine In These Times reminds of the lessons we must keep close in order to make society better and avoid making the same mistakes we’ve made in the past.  Featuring contributions from Barbara Ehrenreich, Tom Frank, Tom Geoghegan, Juan Gonzalez, Chris Hayes, Naomi Klein, Salim Muwakkil, Ralph Nader, Frances Fox Piven, Bernie Sanders, Slavoj Žižek and many others.  Goodreads synopsis: Forty years ago, the richest 1 percent controlled 25 percent of America's wealth. Today it's 40 percent, and the richest one-tenth of 1 percent have as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. Launched in Chicago in 1976, the muckraking, progressive magazine In These Times has been tracking this disastrous history through groundbreaking and heart-wrenching reportage, as well as incisive analysis. This book tells the story of a shockingly successful corporate crackdown, from Reaganomics to the precarious sharing economy, as well as intermittent movements to stem the tide, from the Seattle global justice protests to the Fight for 15.   "When You Find Out the World Is Against You: And Other Funny Memories About Awful Moments" by Kelly Oxford. Amazon When You Find Out the World Is Against You: And Other Funny Memories About Awful Moments by Kelly Oxford Def Street Books, 320 pages In a delightful break from the 24-hour news cycle we’ve grown accustomed to, Kelly Oxford brings a hilarious perspective to all the things we do every day and never talk about…until now. Where you've heard her name before: She’s the author of the bestselling Everything is Perfect When You’re a Liar, but you might just know her from the internet. Goodreads synopsis: Kelly Oxford likes to blow up the Internet. Whether it is with the kind of tweets that led Rolling Stone to name her one of the Funniest People on Twitter, or with pictures of her hilariously adorable family (human and animal), or with something much more serious, like creating the hashtag #NotOkay, where millions of women came together to share their stories of sexual assault, Kelly has a unique, razor-sharp perspective on modern life. As a screen writer, professional sh*t disturber, wife and mother of three, Kelly is about everything but the status quo. When You Find Out the World Is Against You is filled with the biting, wise, and laugh-out-loud insights that have won Kelly legions of fans. Whether she’s detailing her obsession with going to camp as an eleven-year-old so she can become a “kissing bandit,” exploring the bittersweet boredom that so often accompanies parenthood, calling out the insanity of a posse of Internet poodle vigilantes, writing bracingly about the anxiety that has plagued her for as long as she can remember or taking us to ride shotgun as she stalks her husband on an accidental date with another man, When You Find Out the World Is Against You is Kelly at her most honest and disarmingly funny best. Her comedic skill, down-to-earth voice and bull’s-eye observations on the absurdity of modern life mean there is nothing quite like seeing the world through Kelly’s eyes. "Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy" by Jonathan Taplin. Amazon Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy by Jonathan Taplin Little, Brown and Company, 320 pages Move Fast and Break Things is the definitive exploration of the platforms, apps and digital destinations that have emerged over the last 30 years, and is an absolute must-read for anyone who wants to gain a little savvy in the internet era—and learn a bit about the culture of the last three decades while they’re at it. Where you've heard his name before: He’s the director emeritus of the USC Annenberg innovation lab and a film producer. Oh, and he used to be a tour manager for Bob Dylan and The Band.  Goodreads synopsis: Move Fast and Break Things tells the story of how a small group of libertarian entrepreneurs began in the 1990s to hijack the original decentralized vision of the Internet, in the process creating three monopoly firms—Facebook, Amazon and Google—that now determine the future of the music, film, television, publishing and news industries. Taplin offers a succinct and powerful history of how online life began to be shaped around the values of the men who founded these companies, including Peter Thiel and Larry Page: tolerating piracy of books, music and film while at the same time promoting opaque business practices and subordinating privacy of individual users to create the surveillance marketing monoculture in which we now live. The enormous profits that have come with this concentration of power tell their own story. Since 2001, newspaper and music revenues have fallen by 70%, book publishing, film and television profits have also fallen dramatically. Revenues at Google in this same period grew from $400 million to $74.5 billion. Google's YouTube today controls 60% of the streaming audio business and pays only 11% of the streaming audio revenues. More creative content is being consumed that ever before, but less revenue is flowing to creators and owners of the content. With the reallocation of money to monopoly platforms comes a shift in power. Google, Facebook and Amazon now enjoy political power on par with Big Oil and Big Pharma, which in part explains how such a tremendous shift in revenues from artists to platforms could have been achieved and why it has gone unchallenged for so long. "The Case for Impeachment" by Allan J. Lichtman. Amazon The Case for Impeachment by Allan J. Lichtman Def Street Books, 304 pages It’s the very first look at what it is exactly that it would take for our 45th president to be removed from office—and just what precedent such an event has in presidential history. Where you've heard his name before: He has correctly predicted every presidential election since 1984, including the election of 2016.  Goodreads synopsis: Many historians and legal scholars agree that we are facing uncharted political waters and most citizens—politics aside—want to know where the country is headed. Allan J. Lichtman hones in on the 45th President of the United States, demonstrating his view that it is not a question of if President Trump will be impeached, but a question of when. Lichtman illuminates exactly how the impeachment of President Trump might work by showing how his actions—past or future—make him uniquely vulnerable to impeachment proceedings. From his dealings with Russia, to his conflicts of interest at home and abroad, to the numerous civil suits involving him, Lichtman zeroes in on Mr. Trump’s key areas of weakness. He also offers a fascinating look at presidential impeachments throughout American history, including the often-overlooked story of Andrew Johnson’s impeachment, little-known details about Richard Nixon’s resignation, as well as Bill Clinton’s hearings.  "A Grace Paley Reader: Stories, Essays, and Poetry" by Grace Paley.

The two companies have found themselves implicated in a class-action lawsuit because Nexus 6P’s hardware keeps on malfunctioning. The hardware issue is Huawei’s responsibility but on the other hand, Google’s software is not working as intended as well. Nexus 6P owners are complaining about a major issue which causes their smartphones to randomly shut down which means that the devices become practically useless. Nexus 6P The Nexus community is already well aware of the dreaded bootloop mode which affects Nexus 6P. Considering the fact that Nexus 6P has only been out for a year and that it used to hold the title of being Google’s flagship, this kind of issue is unacceptable. The smartphone was marketed as being a mid-budget device which offers a pure Android experience alongside impressive hardware performance. Sadly, this isn’t the case since Nexus 6P’s hardware causes it randomly shutdown. Bootloop Mode The hardware issue that’s affecting Nexus 6P is related to the device’s battery. User reports are showing that even though the smartphone might have over 60 percent of battery charge, it still shuts down. Many believed that this issue is caused by Android 7.0 Nougat, but this doesn’t seem to be the case since the smartphone still keeps on malfunctioning even though it might be flashed back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Google and Huawei Class-Action Lawsuit The two tech giants are being sued by owners of affected Nexus 6P devices. The reason why Nexus 6P owners are taking these drastic measures is because neither Google nor Huawei is taking responsibility for this issue. In fact when Nexus 6P owners called Huawei support, the Chinese tech manufacturer blamed Google and didn’t want to repair the affected smartphones. What’s interesting is that Google managed to prove that the bootloop mode is not being caused by its software. As previously mentioned, even though Nexus 6P’s operating system is downgraded the problem keeps on persisting. It all comes down to Huawei now. The Chinese tech manufacturer needs to step in and take responsibility and repair or replace the malfunctioning smartphones.

A couple of weeks ago, media outlets started showcasing the fact that LG is being sued by its customers. The reason why this happened was because LG’s V20, V10, G4, G5 and Nexus 5X smartphones started presenting the infamous bootloop issue. Now it looks like Huawei and Google are faced with the same problem. The two tech giants have collaborated together and created Nexus 6P. Even though the smartphone used to be known as Google’s flagship device, it seems that it’s still being affected by the dreaded bootloop mode. Class-Action Lawsuit The US based law firm known as Chimicles and Tikellis LLP (C&T) has reported that they are looking to start a lawsuit against Google and Huawei. All of this is happening because Nexus 6P presents the highly annoying bootloop malfunctioning issue. To be more exact, the bootloop mode causes smartphones to randomly shutdown which completely depletes their batteries. The aforementioned law firm has presented an open invitation to all Nexus 6P owners who want to join into this lawsuit. We should mention that Nexus 6P owners can get in touch with the law firm through its official website. Bootloop Malfunctioning Issue The worst thing about this issue is the fact that it can happen any time. Even though the affected smartphone might have a battery charge of over 50 percent, it can still randomly power off. In addition, the only way to turn it on again is to plug it into a charger. Numerous people believed that the bootloop mode has been brought by Android 7.0 Nougat. This is certainly not the case since many have downgraded their Nexus 6P back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow and the issue didn’t go away. Considering the fact that Huawei and Google are some of the biggest names in the tech world, we can be sure that they do not wish to drag their names through the media like this. In the end, Huawei will more than likely decide to take in and repair affected Nexus 6P smartphones in order to avoid this class-action lawsuit.

Pixel smartphones owners have been able to enjoy the fingerprint gestures support feature for a couple of months now. Fortunately, Google decided to provide Nexus 5X and 6P owners with the same feature and included it in Android 7.1.2 Nougat. However, things are not going according to plan. Numerous user reports are showcasing the fact that Android 7.1.2 Nougat has actually caused fingerprint gestures to malfunction on both Pixel and Nexus smartphones. Fingerprint Gestures Support Malfunction Google’s Product Forum has been flooded with complaints from Nexus and Pixel smartphone owners.  The Android parent quickly noticed that and opened a special thread which allows Nexus and Pixel owners to provide additional feedback so that Google is able to fix the issue through an OTA (over the air) software update. It seems like Google’s decision to open a special thread was a wise one since this calmed down the Nexus and Pixel community. The fact that Google is paying close attention to this issue means that a fix is guaranteed. In addition, reports are showing that once Nexus and Pixel owners update their smartphone they are presented with the following error message “Fingerprint hardware not available”. Solution Considering that there is a large number of Pixel and Nexus smartphone owners, Google’s thread is already packed with solutions. Sadly, they do not work at all. Many have tried deleting their cache partition or booting the affected smartphone and nothing has worked. Additionally, some have even deleted their fingerprint scans and tried to add new ones but they were faced with the following message “Enrolment was not complete. Fingerprint enrolment didn’t work. Try again or use a different finger”. Let’s just hope that Google is able to get to the end of it sooner than expected. This might not be some groundbreaking feature, but it does come in the “Android Package” and it should be there. Worth mentioning is that Google is known for promptitude which means that an OTA software should arrive during the upcoming weeks. Until then, all that Nexus and Pixel smartphone owners can do is to simply wait.

Google’s Nexus smartphones are considered as being some of the most developer friendly devices ever made. First off, every Nexus smartphone is powered by Google’s open-source Android operating system and while this might be great for developers, the best thing about Nexus smartphones is the fact that their hardware can be altered as well. For example, a Nexus 5 owner managed to upgrade the device’s on-board storage from 32GB to 64GB. Today we’re going to talk about an even better upgrade, a Nexus 5X owner has equipped its smartphone with the whopping amount of 4GB of RAM. Nexus 5X with 4GB RAM The XDA Forum member known as Cathair2906 is the proud owner of the 4GB RAM Nexus 5X. Many might be wondering how did the XDA member managed to upgrade its smartphone’s storage space and the answer is quite simple, he sent it to a special repairman in China. As many might already know, Nexus 5X is infamous for presenting the bootloop mode. The Nexus 5X in cause has also started malfunctioning and when the owner sent it to LG, the South Korean tech giant declined to repair it as its warranty expired. The smartphone owner was then forced to send it to a special repair shop in China, on his own expense. When the bootloop affected Nexus 5X arrived to the Chinese repairmen, he offered to upgrade its RAM memory for an additional amount of cash. All in all, the reparation and the RAM upgrade costed the XDA member only $60. We should also mention that the XDA member has announced that his smartphone is now running on Android 7.1.1 Nougat and that its extra amount of RAM works flawlessly. Specs Right now we will take a look under Nexus 5X’s hood in order to refresh our memories. The highly popular Android smartphone ships with a 5.2 inch IPS LCD display which offers a full HD resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. In terms of hardware power, Nexus 5X is fueled by Qualcomm’s hexa-core Snapdragon 808 CPU and 2GB of RAM or 4GB in some cases.

Google Hire sneaking up on Seek, TradeMe Jobs Staff reporter Tuesday April 18, 2017 Share Play NBR radio on Google has confirmed it is looking to enter the online recruitment market, taking on the local dominant players, New Zealand-based Trade Me Jobs and Australian-owned Seek. Google has registered the website address googlehire.com and a spokesman confirmed Google Hire is a product under development targeted at customers of its cloud-based G Suite productivity tools (think Gmail, Calendar, and Docs). The product is aimed at allowing employers to manage their hiring process more effectively by collecting candidate applications online. “Only information that a candidate voluntarily provides would be passed to a prospective employer as part of their online application. Private information will not be shared,” the Google spokesperson said. No launch date has been set for Google Hire at this stage although Trade Me Jobs says it has been aware for some time that the online giant has been testing some moves in the employment market. The Axios.com website last week reported Google Hire lets employers post job listings, then accept and manage applications, rivalling services such as Greenhouse and Lever. Several US-based tech companies are said to be testing the new product which is being developed under Google’s enterprise and cloud division. A spokesman for Trade Me Jobs, one of the two major players in online recruitment in New Zealand, says there’s conflicting opinion internationally as to whether Google plans to just provide job applicant tracking for businesses or something more widespread. The Kiwi online employment advertising market is already quite competitive, it says, which is why it has a number of new products in the pipeline. A media spokesman for Seek says it doesn’t comment on other organisations. Read more from Email : Got a question about this story? Leave it in Comments & Questions below.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 April 2017 | MYT 9:00 AM ‘Skinny bundles’ step up challenge to US Big Cable Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and "cord cutters" loath to pay US$100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. — AFP Relaxnews For years, US cable operators got rich by offering fat "bundles" of hundreds of channels and raising prices regularly for television consumers.  Now the "skinny bundle" is disrupting that model with Internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programmes.  Google's YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for US$35 (RM155) monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony's PlayStation Vue, Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now.  More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu.  These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programmes in the Internet "cloud," and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests.  Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and "cord cutters" loath to pay US$100 (RM440) or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire.  A Parks Associates survey last month found 20% of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change.  Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly.  In addition to lower prices, he said, "you don't have to worry about sending out a technician, you don't have to worry about getting the equipment back."  BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled "the big bundle is doomed," says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers.  Established media companies are focusing too hard on "protecting their legacy business model" instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month.  Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while Internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000.  These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold.  The skinny bundles "have made inroads in the past year," said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman.  Digital platforms rise  Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google's entry into the business is significant because "for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows."  He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft "have tried to cosy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed" until now.  "The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries," he said in a blog post.  While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive.  At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite.  But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges.  Some like AT&T already have a "skinny" offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice.  Wolk said consumers don't appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because "they pay 30% less dollars but get 70% less content."  He added that "a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum."  Striking back  Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband Internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle Internet and television.  The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favour their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said.  Operators are also keeping customers with "TV everywhere" which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while traveling, he noted.  One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user.  That's positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers.  Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note.  With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others "get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits." — AFP Related Stories You May Be Interested Snap stock falls as alleged CEO comments rile some on social media For Palestinian family, an udder-ly unique power source Phone app nabs Coachella festival cellphone thief Online ads target Britain’s homeless youths with offer of shelter for sex: charity How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas Late-night construction keeps residents up in Cheras Thanks for defecating advertisement Latest News Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash Phone app nabs Coachella festival cellphone thief Intel to stop hosting the annual Intel Developer Forum National search launched for alleged US ‘Facebook killer’ Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings Most Viewed in Tech SWIFT warns on vendor security after documents leaked by hackers Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings National search launched for alleged US ‘Facebook killer’ Intel to stop hosting the annual Intel Developer Forum Google to open up Android to rivals in out-of-court deal with Russia Snap stock falls as alleged CEO comments rile some on social media New York City taxi commission plans to force Uber to add driver tipping feature Online ads target Britain’s homeless youths with offer of shelter for sex: charity Will autonomous driving kill the sports car?

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

(WTNH) – Kids love video games and apps and now thanks to Google, some New Haven children are learning to build them from scratch. The Elm City’s LEAP program is one of 12 nationwide to receive Google’s prestigious Rise Award. The goal is to increase access to computer science education for children in high poverty neighborhoods. LEAP is a New Haven based academic and social enrichment program for kids and young adults. Now that the program has won a Google Rise Award the focus will be on promoting computer science opportunities to girls and minorities who are historically under represented in the field. LEAP’S Computer Learning Center Director, Shyrelle Spears tells News 8 what the award has meant to the program. “That helped us with getting all the components for the robots, kits for the kids, and new laptops to be able to program so they could be mobile throughout the building,” she said. Fourth grader Samaya Bright says Google’s honor means a lot. “Because if i was someone in a computer lab that makes games and stuff i could know what to have in it, what to make, and to make sure to ask stuff that I know the computer would understand,” Bright said. The kids are learning about coding, robotics, and design. Then they get to build their own games, apps and robots from scratch. Myiah Pearse, a Freshman at Amistad Academy, showed News 8 what she was working on. “This project we’re building a robot with different types of motors and materials to basically make it work,” according to Pearse. Jaidyn Gambrell, a Freshman at Co-op High School, told us the program is generating plans for the future. “What i’m getting out of it is how to work with electric wiring and programming which is really helpful to use because technology is rapidly advancing day by day so when i’m older i’m going to know what i’m doing,” Gambrell said. The program is making an early impact with the hope of opening more doors to students in the future.

Primary sources. Global perspective. advertisement Google reaches settlement with Russia regulators Monday 17 April 2017 at 2:06 PM ET by Lawrenz Fares ©  WikiMedia (Ardo191 at English Wikipedia) [JURIST] Alphabet Inc. [official website], owner of Google, and the Russian Federal Anti-monopoly Service (FAS) [official website], reached [FAS press release] an out-of-court settlement with in a dispute over Google's requiring Android phone manufacturers to pre-install its own search tool on Monday. In 2015 the FAS ruled that this requirement was an abuse of Google's market dominance and its actions excluded competing Russian search engines such as Yandex [official website]. After the FAS imposed a $7.8 million US fine on Google, Alphabet Inc. proposed a settlement in which the company agreed to refrain from requiring manufactures to pre-install their search engine services on Android devices. In its place, Google will develop a new Chrome widget which will allow end users to install the search applications of any company they desire. According to the settlement, Russian competitors will be able to begin contacting Google for their inclusion in the new search widget in 60 days. The head of the FAS, Igor Artemiev [official profile], stated: Implementation of the settlement’s terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications. We managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices. The settlement’s execution will have a positive effect on the market as a whole, while giving developers additional options for promoting their products.FAS first began investigation Google's search software practices after Yandex filed a complaint in 2015. In September 2015 the FAS ruled that Google's practices violated Part 1 Article 10 of the Russian Federal Law [text] by using its dominant position in the market to exclude competitors from its Android devices. Google has faced numerous anti-trust claims all over the world. In April 2016 the EU levied [CNN report] anti-trust charges against Google for some of the same practices addressed in the FAS's suit. Google is currently facing a $3.4 billion US anti-trust fine from the European Commission in the matter.

Some Google Wifis randomly stop working, turn solid blue Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Bug Watch Google Wifi News If your Google Wifi seems to be looking a bit blue these days — as in, the light is stuck blue — you might want to check to see if it's still actually functioning. The current build for it (9202.35.8) seems to be causing issues for some users. You probably know if you've been affected since, well, your Google Wifi won't be working. Other means of detection and confirmation manifest themselves via a steady blue light on the primary hub, at which point the satellite hubs may start to flash orange signifying a disconnect of the primary hub. In the meantime it seems that restarting that primary hub fixes the issue, but only temporarily. To be very clear, this is not a universal problem. It could be related to the latest build (9202.35.8). Even then, not all users are reporting this, and the precise nature of the cause has not been reported. But, a reasonably large number of individuals on Google's forums have been experiencing this particular issue. Google has responded on the forum with some information, reassurance, and instructions for those affected, saying, "Our team is still looking into this and working hard on getting a fix out-- we aim to have it out as soon as possible." More information for those who find they may be experiencing this problem is available below: The engineering team is still working on a final fix for this issue. However, over the past few days our support team has seen two workarounds that make help resolve the issue temporarily until the fix is released. These have worked in a few cases, and may be worth a try. 1. Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app. 2. Disconnect wireless Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices (or connect them via ethernet instead). There have been a few cases in which disconnecting any Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices has brought the Google Wifi network back up again without crashes. You can also reach out to our support team (g.co/wificare or wifica...@google.com), who will be able to provide more deep-dive troubleshooting advice based on the topography of your network. As always, thank you for your patience while we work on this issue. Both of the potential fixes at this time seem a bit unfortunate; neither having to switch to a new google account nor giving up using a Windows 10 device sound very great, but hopefully Google will have things solved quickly.

Sean Are the finger print readers messed up as well? Artem Russakovskii It also reboots at 30% battery. Josh Crumley Breaks SafetyNet too so no Android Pay dan And now it blueloops Jon Fridman #artemsluck Max Running that build on mine without issues. Artem Russakovskii Same here, because it's the latest current build - every Wifi should be on it right now. Kevin Davis Disconnect Windows & Xbox devices? GTFOH Google, fix your sh*t. enoch861 Haha, I'm so shocked that's actually a suggested fix I laughed out loud. It's like them saying "Don't use the internet and you won't have issues." This is why I stay away from a majority of Google hardware. 4Ui812 Google is aiming for continuity by breaking all of their products. berto1014 No kidding, sounds like their QA/QC lately is borderline nonexistent. TeutonJon78 Lately? It's been downhill since KK. whispy_snippet For goodness sake. Because WiFi wasn't already annoying enough. Leif Sikorski Service, testing and quality control ... something Google likes to fail at. They save money on the wrong end and that's why they'll never be a big competing hardware company. catalysto Apple products get bugs like this, too. dan At least when apple breaks something like fingerprint readers it's by design. MJ "Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app." WTF? A factory reset won't work but using a different Google account will? Does this concern anyone? There is ZERO reason to have a/your Google account tied to a piece of hardware like a router. This is your second warning. This was the first --> http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/23/google-onhub-wifi-units-randomly-dying-people-requiring-factory-resets/ 😆😄 Not concerning at all. The Google account just acts as the intermediary for the OAuth2 tokens that the app and the devices use to share data. Would you rather sign in with a login/pass every time you open the Google Wifi app instead? MJ Not concerning at all? We have already had one incident where the Google Accounts engine reset people's routers and another incident where using the original Google account that setup can't be used to fix a problem. Yes! I rather use a login/password local to router itself to logon. I have always owned my router and never had the need to use an "app" to access it. LOL The couple of times I need to change a setting on my router a year my PC is a better tool to do that. ericshmerick Bah, let MJ make everyone feel as if the sky is falling!!!11!11 4Ui812 Just " Google it " is said among people when they need information. When their phone or other hardware has issues people will start saying "it's Googled" . 4Ui812 Does Google search know what's wrong with Google's hardware/software or should people just Bing it ? Deeco Google has the worst quality control ever from why company. Ryan Moving the functionality to Google Express robertlwalters This killed my Asus OnHub AD1980 There's that high quality we've come to expect from Google products charles anderson I was doing some test on one of my onhubs earlier and once I reset it on this build that was it it would no longer work I couldn't reset it at all or reconnect to it it also wouldn't get an IP address from my ISP at all so there's that.🤔 sbeaulieu Fuck. Come on Google. Lare2 This is whats happens when Google wants to apply their philosophy of iterate fast to infrastructure equipment where you need rock solid stability. Get your act together Google, this is not a freaking gadget you can just push new stuff to it and wait to see what happens. Geeeez Bruce Wayne Very few things come out of this company that don't break down and have issues. They should focus on improving their current crop of products and services rather than rushing things out and implementing poor quality control.

The update brings it in line with Google's own Material Design guidelines, improves the mobile view, and introduces new top-level tabs to improve navigation. Previous design: Out with the old This is the place to go for those who want to customize and port their own build of Android. As well as offering the Android source code itself, the website also contains vast amounts of instructional information. The overhaul has included a reorganization of content to allow for easier browsing and searching. Surprisingly, given the subject matter, the mobile browsing experience wasn't the friendliest before. Now, with a dedicated mobile view and responsive design, the site looks great on whichever device you choose to view it. Even on a desktop, it is much better looking, filling the full width of the screen and using larger, more legible type. The site's previous design had a decidedly Android 4.4 KitKat feel to it, so it's good to see it finally brought up to speed. The security section has also been pushed to the fore in the new navigation — according to Google, this mirrors its ever-increasing focus on keeping the Android platform safe going forward.

LOL With the whole ecosystem, unless they make the apps cross compatible or a very clean cross compile and delivery system, it isn't changing anytime soon. Fadakar So it's not outdated for the next 4 years? Do you know understand how that works? Raphael Duran On unrelated news I found this new "My Apps" layout on the Play Store today.

By Don Hazen / AlterNet April 17, 2017 Print Comments Photo Credit: Steve Rhodes / Flickr Most of us are active on Facebook, use many of Google’s assets (search, YouTube, calendar) and get Amazon products dropped at our doorsteps. But have we ever stopped to think about the enormous impact these three companies have had on our lives and our society? Well, Jonathan Taplin has given it a lot of thought. The result is a breakthrough, must-read book, Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy. The book tells the tale of how the internet “was hijacked by a small group of right-wing radicals [led by Trump supporter Peter Thiel] for whom the ideas of democracy and decentralization were an anathema.” The upshot is that the dominant philosophy of Silicon Valley became heavily based on the radical libertarian ideology of Ayn Rand. The internet is not the product of any mythical cooperative notion as the public may think, shaped by the pervasive, effectively marketed illusion of goodness symbolized by Google’s tagline: “Don’t Be Evil” (changed to “Do the Right Thing” in 2015 in Google’s code of conduct). The result: “Not since Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan has there been such a concentration of wealth and power” in the hands of so few, according to Taplin’s book. “And the enormous unprecedented fortunes created by the digital revolution have done much to increase inequality in America.” The five largest firms in the world (based upon market valuation) are Apple, Google (now known as Alphabet), Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. In terms of their monopoly power, Google has an 88 percent market share in search and search advertising. Google’s Android operating system has an 80 percent global market share in its category. Amazon has a 70 percent market share in ebooks, and 51 percent of goods purchased online are from Amazon. Facebook has a 77 percent share on mobile social media. Google and Facebook have more than one billion customers, and Amazon has 350 million. As their “relentless pursuit of efficiency leads these companies to treat all media as commodity,” according to Taplin, “the real value lies in the gigabytes of personal data scraped from your profile as you pursue the latest music video, news article or listicle.” The value amassed from their methods is enormous. Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos are in the top 10 of the wealthiest people in America, according to the Forbes 400 list. Each has a personal fortune worth over $37 billion, with Bezos recently becoming the second wealthiest person in the world with a net worth of $75.6 billion.  Jonathan Taplin is an insider/outsider in the music, film and tech businesses. His career stretches from his college days as a roadie and tour manager for The Band and Bob Dylan, to a collaborator and producer of music, film and TV for 30 years, working with Martin Scorsese, among others. He started his own tech business only to run up against many of the realities he describes in his book. He has been a longtime professor and is currently director emeritus of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California. Taplin’s book is a tour de force—a compelling, story-driven work focusing on the handful of men who have shaped and essentially taken over the massive tech industry. Along the way, Taplin tells his own personal story with charm and insight. If you want to understand what has happened to our country and where tech will take us in the era of Trump, put aside some time to read this book. It will take your breath away. Taplin and I spoke by phone in early April. Don Hazen: Do you agree with me that your story about the dominance of antidemocratic, monopoly-oriented, radical libertarianism values of the titans of technology is not well known? And if so, why? Jonathan Taplan: I totally agree it’s not well known. The reason is because the tech barons, who are the new robber barons, have done a PR job on America that has been very successful... The strange thing is that the one guy who was not a libertarian, Steve Jobs, probably did more to raise the halo effect of tech than anybody. He is the one guy whose company respected copyright. In a regular speech I give, I point out that a musician who got a million downloads of one song on iTunes would make $900,000; and if they got a million downloads on YouTube (owned by Google) they’d make $900. DH: Wow, that’s really depressing. Another aspect could be that most of us use Google and Facebook all the time. We want these companies to be benign in our lives, right? We don’t want to deal with the fact that they are both destructive and convenient. JT: Well, it seems like it has no cost, but that of course isn’t true. It has many costs. Obviously, fake news could not exist without Google and Facebook. A kid in Macedonia with a Facebook page and a Google AdSense account could make $10,000 a week just putting out phony stuff. That could never happen if you didn’t have these open platforms. Also, we all pay more because advertisers have to pay a premium to buy ads on Facebook and Google, because they’re what they call micro-targeted. An advertiser says, “I want women in the Nashville metro area who drink bourbon and drive trucks,” and Facebook can do that. DH: We can even do that at AlterNet—we call it geo-targeting. We’re a progressive nonprofit that’s dependent on Google for close to half of our revenue. JT: Yeah. Well, there’s no place else to go. DH: That’s the definition of a monopoly, right? JT: Yep. DH: You say the real value in these companies and their profits lies in the gigabytes of personal data scraped from profiles as you pursue the latest music video, news article, etc. Can you say more about that? Are we fundamentally all being victimized? What are the ramifications? JT: They are essentially monetizing your life, your desires, your dreams, whatever, and you’re not really getting any advantage for that monetization; they are. Certainly the people who make the content, whether it’s AlterNet or most other content makers, are not getting much advantage considering the size of your audience... You are on the bottom end of the food chain in terms of where the advertising dollars flow. For most it feels like, Oh, well, I’m just exchanging all in my life in return for convenience. That isn’t to say you couldn’t have convenience if there were more players in the marketplace. There’s nothing implicit about having one social network and one search engine. DH: Peter Thiel is the chief villain of your book. He is a very powerful Silicon Valley radical libertarian, who started PayPal, is on the board of Facebook, and is a mentor and funder of what is sometimes called the PayPal mafia—many who have gone on to start other big successes like LinkedIn. Some of what he says is pretty scary, like: “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” What’s the path forward for Peter Thiel? Is his influence growing? JT: His influence since I wrote the book has grown immensely, because he’s Jared Kushner’s best friend and he’s inside the White House and Donald Trump is holding his hand. He has extraordinary power in the White House in terms of determining technology policy. In fact, there’s even some rumors that Trump’s second Supreme Court appointment would be Peter Thiel. DH: Oh my god, I didn’t hear that. Kushner has always been a moderate Democrat. How does he become so simpatico with somebody like Thiel, who is so right wing? JT: Here’s the deal. These people in Silicon Valley have been able to put a Svengali move on the Democrats just as much as they put on the Republicans. Obama was under the spell of Google more than anybody I know about. Eric Schmidt [executive chairman of Alphabet] visited the White House by a factor of five more than any other CEO, and that’s just the official stuff that was written down at the White House gate. DH: You mention the fact that Sean Parker, Larry Page and I think Thiel all went to the secret meeting of Republicans too, so they’ve got all the bases covered at Google? JT: They don’t have any political affiliation whatsoever. They may pretend that they’re liberals, but they’re perfectly happy to be conservatives. In fact, one of the stories I tell in the book is that when the conservatives and Fox News and Rush Limbaugh were pounding on Facebook that their trending topics thing was being slanted against conservative media because the kids who were running it, who were the curators, were too liberal, Zuckerberg said, “Okay, well, I’m getting rid of the kids.” He fired them all and he just let the algorithm determine what got into trending topics. Which was exactly what Steve Bannon and Cambridge Analytica wanted, because then they could play the algorithm with their armies of bots that they deployed, and completely push anything up trending topics that they wanted to. DH: Further on in the book, you give Zuckerberg a bit of an optimistic pass in terms of hoping or thinking that he really cares about the four billion people who are not on the internet. He’s not at the same level as Page and Thiel and Parker? JT: I don’t know. I probably would say that Bill Gates’ wife, Melinda, had more to do with him changing his life than anything. My sense is that Zuckerberg’s wife [Priscilla Chan] is a deeply committed humanist. She was a teacher, and I think like any of these guys, there’s probably a little bit of a battle for his soul. The very fact that she convinced him to give away 99 percent of their Facebook stock to a charity, even though it’s kind of a weird charity organization that he controls, is something. It’s certainly not what Larry Page or Peter Thiel are doing. They’re giving money to organizations so they can live to 150 years old. DH: We’re going to save that part until the end, because going to Mars and living forever is a whole final question about what makes these guys tick. Before we get there, let’s go backwards to Ayn Rand. When we were in college, these were crackpot theories, and we always thought they were books that kids read in high school or maybe as sophomores in college, and then we all grew up. Peter Thiel, who is apparently one of the smartest guys in the world, seems to worship the Ayn Rand narrative. What is that about? JT: You know, it mystifies me so much. Paul Ryan and Donald Trump have both cited Ayn Rand as major influences on their life. My guess is it appeals to a certain kind of man who believes that he is better than most people, and he’s not appreciated. If you look at those Ayn Rand heroes, they always thought that the average citizen was a total dunce, and that democracy wasn’t a good idea, and that really things had to be run by men of iron will who had no sense of responsibility for other people, just for themselves. They were the kind of people [who would ask], the line that she used is, “Who will stop me?” It’s that kind of pushing, that "I’m going to just forge ahead," and it’s the will of the power. Like all that stuff we studied about Nietzsche in Princeton probably. DH: Thiel also said he was for Trump because he would discipline the unthinking demos, the democratic public that constrains capitalism. That’s pretty scary as well. Do we think Trump understands that? JT: Well, look, I think that they believe capitalism works best when there’s no rules, and they tend to think that the people who want to try and make rules for capitalism don’t understand it, and so they’re going to just screw it up. What Trump is doing right now is trying to get rid of every regulation, whether it’s environmental or internet privacy or anything you can imagine. He just wants to get rid of all these regulations, because he wants Verizon or Google or Exxon or Koch Industries to be able to just do whatever they want to do and not worry about regulation. Of course, I think that’s what leads to things like the financial crisis in 2008, when the banks had no regulation and they just went crazy. DH: Speaking of deregulation, you write about a New York Times article on a World Bank report that says internet innovation stands to widen inequality, and even hasten the hollowing out of the middle class. How does this happen? JT: Well, first place, tech delivers extraordinary monetary returns to a very small group of people. The biggest tech company is employing 20,000-30,000 people, compared to, say, an auto company or General Electric that employs hundreds of thousands. That’s the first thing. Secondly, it delivers returns to the highest level of those executives of those companies on such a level that Zuckerberg is worth $58.6 billion (fifth richest person in the world), that Bezos is worth $80 billion. In other words, if you’re at the top, your wealth is so great that it inevitably leads to inequality, because what tech does also obviously is eliminate a lot of working-class jobs. The better Elon Musk gets at making his cars, the fewer people he has to hire. He lets the robots do it. DH: Apparently, according to Capital and Main, the workers at Tesla are not very happy either. JT: I bet they aren’t. DH: It was lovely to read in your book about The Band, Bob Dylan, Music from Big Pink and Woodstock, the story of your early days of rock 'n' roll, when you began to understand how this digital music system worked. It’s a sad story, because it ends up with Levon Helm, a member of The Band, dying of throat cancer and not being able to make any money because he couldn’t go on the road. Performers didn’t really have anyone protecting them like writers who had ASCAP and BMI. Of course, behind this is Sean Parker, the king of digital destruction. Can you juxtapose for a moment Sean Parker and Levon Helm and what happened? JT: Right. Sean Parker was kind of a bratty kid who got into trouble for doing hacking, and while he was on probation, he met another guy who was named Shawn Fanning, and they invented Napster. Their thought was, Well, look at all these tunes [that] are digital now that the CD is out, and what we need to do is build this service that allows anybody to share their music with anybody else for free; what we need to do is just index it. That’s what they did. Of course, not being musicians, at first they had no idea that it would destroy the music business. And when they fairly quickly got the idea that it was destroying the music business, they didn’t give a f**k. What they cared for was to build this business, which they did to about 70 million users in two years. Once people got a taste of getting music for free, then that made it seem like all music should be free. Same thing happened in the newspaper business. Once people got a little free news, then why should they pay for news? Why should I buy a newspaper? Newspaper revenues and music revenues plunged by 70 percent from the year 2001 until 2015. That’s just extraordinary, the business cut by two-thirds. I think that what happened is obviously Levon could no longer make a living off of the music, even though if you went to YouTube, the number of plays of "The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down" was in the millions; but he wasn’t getting any money from that. That’s the sad story, and it’s not just Levon. There’s thousands of musicians. T-Bone Burnett and I do a talk every once in a while, and we run into just hundreds of musicians who can’t make a living anymore. DH: What does it mean, what you describe as the surveillance marketing business? You say that both Facebook and Google are in this business now. JT: Their main business is what I’ve begun to call surveillance capitalism. Basically, it’s a new kind of capitalism, which means that the greatest value that I hold is the amount of data that I have been able to sweep up from every possible realm on you, Don Hazen. I’m going to get it from your mobile phone, from your shopping online, from your location, from in your home if you have an Amazon Alexa, with the microphone on. I’m going to vacuum it up from there. I’m going to basically look for more places where I can grab your data. The key to doing that of course is to get you to go on my services, whether it’s YouTube or search or on Facebook, and stay there as long as possible, and the more you stay there, the more data I’m grabbing from you. Now, I take that data, and I sell it back to advertisers in a way of being able to target a very narrow page of just who I want to get to. And it is not just companies that do that. Politicians, as we saw in the past election, can do that just as easily. If you want to suppress the vote among young black men in Detroit, it’s very easy to just send to them a piece of content that says, “Hillary Clinton says all young black men are predators.” You can be assured that that will be somewhat successful. DH: How did the $84 billion Koch brothers get into your book about tech monopolies? JT: Because they provided, through ALEC and the other organizations that they finance, the underlying power in Washington, D.C., to make sure that companies don’t get regulated. If you think about some of the problems that Trump is having now, these guys thought that the Republican health care bill was too much regulation in it, and so they offered basically a bounty to any of the Freedom Caucus who would vote against it. They said, “We'll put up to $2 million in ad money for your campaign if Trump comes after you.” Basically, these people have so much money, they’re just... basically the Peter Thiels and Larry Pages have just kind of surfed behind their propaganda, which says the market is always right, and the government is always wrong. When the government tried to do a few things to regulate Google, they come down on the government like a ton of bricks. Why do you think this internet privacy law was passed so quickly? Because the Koch brothers said it was fine. DH: This question has to do with what you mentioned earlier about outsized imaginations. Musk is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to go to Mars, and Page and Thiel are investing as many millions to extend their lives. What does this tell us about these guys? JT: It just seems so bizarre to me that we haven’t solved malaria or typhoid or cholera, and these guys are spending millions of dollars so they personally can live to be 200 years old. Now, to my mind the whole idea is insane because I would imagine by the time you were 130, you had spent four or five million to extend your life—because it’ll be expensive, and only the rich will be able to afford it—you’d be so afraid to come out of your house because you might get hit by a car and your whole $5 million investment would go down the tubes. It would seem to me you’d become a prisoner of your own longevity. I don’t know, but the whole thing is so screwy to me. Elon Musk, at this conference that I went to that Vanity Fair put on, literally said, “We should set off a nuclear bomb on Mars, and it would melt the ice, and then we could grow vegetables to feed the colonies.” DH: That’s wild. Really crazy. All right, anything else I should be asking you?  JT: I think you’ve covered it, man. I’m pleased that you liked the book. DH: There is so much shocking and sobering information in your book that it should be required reading for everyone who wants to understand how we have arrived at this point in history, and the connections between tech monopoly, inequality and even Trump’s election. JT: Sean Wilentz, a Princeton professor friend who runs the history department there, said, “Tap, you’re the new muckraker.” I said, “Well, that’s kind of cool.” Because in a sense, 100 years ago we had to face this same problem with Standard Oil and J.P. Morgan and the railroads. We’ve been here before. The 1912 election between Wilson and Teddy Roosevelt was run on [the question:] what do we do about monopolies? That was the main issue. DH: Yes, but it is more difficult now because there’s no split in the ruling class. Obama was just as tight with Google as the Republicans, or more so. It was easier to scapegoat the railroads or Rockefeller and Standard Oil than it is to do the same thing to the guys wearing hoodies and sneakers, and saying, “We do no evil.” JT: I know. I know. I will tell you, Don, that I think the dialogue is beginning to change. I was at a Chicago conference last week on monopoly, and it was at the Chicago School of Business, which is the most conservative, where Milton Friedman dominated. By the end of the conference even the old-fashioned Friedmanites were saying, “This surveillance capitalism is different, and we may have to rethink what we thought about regulation and monopoly.” I think something’s changing. DH: The challenge is that many of us just don’t want to hear the reality about these companies because it makes our lives more uncomfortable, more challenging. Because we shouldn’t be doing half the stuff we’re doing, it’s just easier. We hang out on Facebook, give our information to Google, don’t take our money out of Merrill Lynch, Chase or Citibank. And often we don’t support local business—just have Amazon delivering those packages, helping make Bezos a gazillionaire, because it is easier to do. Anyway, congratulations on the book. I hope it is a big success.

This is because in the latest update to the app, Google has introduced a couple of new features, one of which is integration with iMessage which means that users can now share their location via iMessage using Google Maps if that’s what they prefer. Using the feature is pretty straightforward and appears to be similar to Apple’s very own “Send my current location” feature in iMessage. Locations are sent to the person that will display a small map, which when pressed will launch Google Maps. However as noted by AppleInsider, the location sharing feature with Google Maps is not dynamically updated so that’s something you might want to take note of. In addition to the integration with iMessage, the update also adds a new Directions widget to iOS. If you’ve always preferred Google Maps to Apple Maps, then this new feature will come in handy. Just like Apple Maps, this new Directions widget for Google Maps will allow users to use turn-by-turn directions from their phone’s lock screen itself. It does not appear to be quite as rich compared to that of Apple Maps, but it should be good enough to get the job done. The update is already live and users can grab the update from the iTunes App Store. Filed in Apple >Cellphones. Read more about Apps, Google Maps, imessage and iOS.

The deal sets a new precedent for the tech giant, which faces multiple complaints worldwide that it is abusing its dominant position by imposing restrictions on manufacturers of Android-based devices in order to protect its share of the online search market. Russia’s competition watchdog, FAS, ruled in 2015 that Google was breaking the law by requiring the pre-installation of applications, including its own search tool, on mobile devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia’s Yandex. Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications, as part of a deal with FAS, the regulator said yesterday. It will also develop a tool allowing users to choose a default search engine on their Android devices. “Users will be able to change settings at any time and choose the default search engine which suits their needs,” FAS said. Google confirmed the deal, saying it met the interests of all parties. It also said it had reached a commercial agreement with Yandex that “provides new opportunities for Yandex to promote its search service within Chrome (internet browser).” Alexander Shulgin, head of Yandex Russian operations, said he hoped the agreement will have implications for similar cases in Europe and elsewhere. Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up 7.2 per cent by 1534 GMT to US$24.39 (RM107.54) while Google was up 1.2 per cent. The deal is for a term of six years and nine months and was approved by a Russian court yesterday. Under the terms of the agreement, Google will still have to pay a total of 439 million roubles in fines. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Hackers exploit Japan’s mobile gamers with fake fantasy cash Google to open up Android to rivals in out-of-court deal with Russia Netflix growth misses mark despite strong earnings Cleveland killing leads Facebook to review handling of videos Most have switched to 3G as 2G shuts down tomorrow in Singapore That fingerprint sensor on your phone is not as safe as you think Nintendo to release mini-size Switch in 2019, Citigroup predicts US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts This prototype flight suit brings you that much closer to your Iron Man dreams (VIDEO) Facebook looking at behaviour to weed out fake accounts Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: North Korea is ‘ready to react’ to war, says DPRK ambassador to UN Reuters Video: New nanofibre solution turns ordinary mesh screens into air pollution filters Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles (VIDEO) Apple eyes backing Hon Hai bid for Toshiba chip unit Google trains ad computers to be offended Charleston East: Google’s new campus in Mountain View (VIDEO) Google allows users to share their locations in mapping app Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services
Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish ‘Google Hire’ Could Be Google’s Answer To LinkedIn By Tyler Lee on 04/17/2017 17:51 PDT We’ve seen how Google has tried to emulate certain popular apps and services in the past, such as how when social media was on the rise, Google tried to get in on it by launching Orkut and then Google+, although safe to say that neither have quite the same reach that Facebook has. Now it seems that Google could be attempting at launching another social networking platform in the form of “Google Hire”, which according to a report from Axios seems to be the company’s answer to LinkedIn. From what the report says, this service allows employers to post things like job listings, accept and manage applications, and so on. Google has since confirmed the existence of the website in a statement to Engadget which reads, “Google Hire is a product under development that will help G Suite customers manage their hiring process more effectively. The product will allow employers to collect candidate applications online. Only information that a candidate voluntarily provides would be passed to a prospective employer as part of their online application. Private information will not be shared.” It isn’t surprising that Google might be running experiments like that so whether or not Google Hire will eventually become a full-fledged product remains to be seen, and whether it will be able to compete with the likes of LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and Monster is also something that the company needs to consider in terms of differentiating features.

Some Google Wifis randomly stop working, turn solid blue Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/17 5:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 3 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares66 Bug Watch Google Wifi News If your Google Wifi seems to be looking a bit blue these days — as in, the light is stuck blue — you might want to check to see if it's still actually functioning. The current build for it (9202.35.8) seems to be causing issues for some users. You probably know if you've been affected since, well, your Google Wifi won't be working. Other means of detection and confirmation manifest themselves via a steady blue light on the primary hub, at which point the satellite hubs may start to flash orange signifying a disconnect of the primary hub. In the meantime it seems that restarting that primary hub fixes the issue, but only temporarily. To be very clear, this is not a universal problem. It could be related to the latest build (9202.35.8). Even then, not all users are reporting this, and the precise nature of the cause has not been reported. But, a reasonably large number of individuals on Google's forums have been experiencing this particular issue. Google has responded on the forum with some information, reassurance, and instructions for those affected, saying, "Our team is still looking into this and working hard on getting a fix out-- we aim to have it out as soon as possible." More information for those who find they may be experiencing this problem is available below: The engineering team is still working on a final fix for this issue. However, over the past few days our support team has seen two workarounds that make help resolve the issue temporarily until the fix is released. These have worked in a few cases, and may be worth a try. 1. Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app. 2. Disconnect wireless Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices (or connect them via ethernet instead). There have been a few cases in which disconnecting any Windows 10 devices or Xbox devices has brought the Google Wifi network back up again without crashes. You can also reach out to our support team (g.co/wificare or wifica...@google.com), who will be able to provide more deep-dive troubleshooting advice based on the topography of your network. As always, thank you for your patience while we work on this issue. Both of the potential fixes at this time seem a bit unfortunate; neither having to switch to a new google account nor giving up using a Windows 10 device sound very great, but hopefully Google will have things solved quickly.

Artem Russakovskii Same here, because it's the latest current build - every Wifi should be on it right now. Kevin Davis Disconnect Windows & Xbox devices? GTFOH Google, fix your sh*t. enoch861 Haha, I'm so shocked that's actually a suggested fix I laughed out loud. It's like them saying "Don't use the internet and you won't have issues." This is why I stay away from a majority of Google hardware. 4Ui812 Google is aiming for continuity by breaking all of their products. berto1014 No kidding, sounds like their QA/QC lately is borderline nonexistent. TeutonJon78 Lately? It's been downhill since KK. whispy_snippet For goodness sake. Because WiFi wasn't already annoying enough. Leif Sikorski Service, testing and quality control ... something Google likes to fail at. They save money on the wrong end and that's why they'll never be a big competing hardware company. catalysto Apple products get bugs like this, too. dan At least when apple breaks something like fingerprint readers it's by design. MJ "Attempt to setup GWifi from scratch using a different owner account. This can mean creating a new Google account, or using a family member's Google account to setup the Google Wifi devices through the GW app." WTF? A factory reset won't work but using a different Google account will? Does this concern anyone? There is ZERO reason to have a/your Google account tied to a piece of hardware like a router. This is your second warning. This was the first --> http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/23/google-onhub-wifi-units-randomly-dying-people-requiring-factory-resets/ 😆😄 Not concerning at all. The Google account just acts as the intermediary for the OAuth2 tokens that the app and the devices use to share data. Would you rather sign in with a login/pass every time you open the Google Wifi app instead? MJ Not concerning at all? We have already had one incident where the Google Accounts engine reset people's routers and another incident where using the original Google account that setup can't be used to fix a problem. Yes! I rather use a login/password local to router itself to logon. I have always owned my router and never had the need to use an "app" to access it. LOL The couple of times I need to change a setting on my router a year my PC is a better tool to do that. ericshmerick Bah, let MJ make everyone feel as if the sky is falling!!!11!11 4Ui812 Just " Google it " is said among people when they need information. When their phone or other hardware has issues people will start saying "it's Googled" . 4Ui812 Does Google search know what's wrong with Google's hardware/software or should people just Bing it ? Deeco Google has the worst quality control ever from why company. Ryan Moving the functionality to Google Express robertlwalters This killed my Asus OnHub AD1980 There's that high quality we've come to expect from Google products charles anderson I was doing some test on one of my onhubs earlier and once I reset it on this build that was it it would no longer work I couldn't reset it at all or reconnect to it it also wouldn't get an IP address from my ISP at all so there's that.🤔 sbeaulieu Fuck. Come on Google. Lare2 This is whats happens when Google wants to apply their philosophy of iterate fast to infrastructure equipment where you need rock solid stability. Get your act together Google, this is not a freaking gadget you can just push new stuff to it and wait to see what happens. Geeeez Bruce Wayne Very few things come out of this company that don't break down and have issues. They should focus on improving their current crop of products and services rather than rushing things out and implementing poor quality control.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Today, we’ll take a look at the new Google Wifi points themselves. Priced at $129 for one, with a three pack available for $299, Google is selling their Home Wi-Fi system at a considerably cheaper price than their competitors. Compare pricing to NETGEAR Orbi ($399 for two devices, $249 for the base router – see our review) and $499 eero (three pack – review) and, on paper, Google Wifi looks like great value. Ubiquiti Networks’ AmpliFi HD (my review) is closer on price – $149 for the base router (which can be meshed with additional devices) and $349 for a three-point pack. Specifications Google WiFi is designed around a dual-band 2×2 AC1200 router offering speeds up to 867 Mbps on the 5 GHz band and 300 Mbps at 2.4 GHz. The specs are broadly equivalent to the likes of eero and Luma, while AmpliFi HD – on paper – offers a slightly higher class AC1750 router. NETGEAR Orbi is perhaps the most innovative design we’ve seen to date. It’s a tri-band AC3000 device that dedicates on of its two 5 GHz bands to transmit data between the WiFi points. While that means that the network itself (as far as your clients are concerned) is AC1200, that dedicated link (known as a backhaul) has proven itself to offer faster satellite connections than Orbi’s competitors. Google Wifi is powered by a quad-core ARM CPU (of unspecified origin) with each core suporting speeds up to 710 MHz. There’s 512 GB RAM in support alongside 4 GB eMMC flash RAM. Each WiFi point is equipped with two Gigabit Ethernet ports. While that’s meagre compared to a traditional router (probably meaning that advanced users will require a network switch like the trusty NETGEAR GS108 I use with my OnHub) there’s an important distinction to be made. Unlike several competitors, Google has enabled the Ethernet ports for use as backhaul connections. Those that have Ethernet wiring (or coaxial cables for MoCA 2.0 adapters) can take advantage of high-speed connections between their WiFi points, ensuring that speeds are optimised when connecting to remote WiFi points. Not all mesh WiFi systems offer this feature today and we’ll be testing performance later with a wired and wireless backhaul to see just how big an advantage it is, Like many of this new crop of home WiFi systems the hardware is small, compact and cute – a far cry from the traditional router designs with extensive arrays of external antennas. Like its close cousin, Google Home, users are encouraged to place Google Wifi points out on show, helping to ensure strong connectivity with other Wi-fi points and wireless devices around the home. Google’s recommendation is that a single Google Wifi point (the first point will replace your router and will connect to your Internet modem) will support smaller apartments and homes between 500 and 1500 sq. ft. A medium home (1500-3000 square feet) should need two Wifi points for strong coverage while the three pack is designed to serve homes between 3000-4500 square feet. Completing the specifications are Beamforming support (helping direct wireless signals to your devices) and Bluetooth Smart. Unlike Google OnHub, the company has made no mention of 802.15.4 (Zigbee) smart home support (note that this radio hasn’t been enabled on OnHub to date) but investigations at SmallNetBuilder have revealed that it’s included. An integrated Infineon SLB9615 TPM (trusted platform module, the same chip fitted to Google OnHub) strengthens security – the device will refuse to boot if any unauthorised changes are made to its software. Those comparing specifications with Google OnHub (handy rundown here) will note that Google Wifi is equipped with a slightly lower specification on paper (2×2 AC1200 vs 3×3 AC1900) but we’ll see whether that translates into a different in real world performance. As discussed in Part 1 of the review, Google WiFi and Google OnHub are compatible and can be combined in a mesh network. What’s in the Box? One benefit of the slightly humbler specification is that Google Wifi is certainly smaller than the already diminutive Google OnHub. Resembling a over-tall hockey puck, each device measures just 4.17 in (106.12 mm) in diameter and 2.70 in (68.75 mm) in height. Google Wifi’s packaging is as premium as the other devices recently launched under the “Made by Google” banner, Google Home and the Google Pixel/Pixel XL smartphone. The crisp white carton doesn’t quite hit the heights of the TP-Link Google OnHub pack, but you’re left in no doubt as to the quality you’ve purchased. Each Wi-fi point ships with a 15W power adapter, 6 foot flat Ethernet cable (which is great) and a short quickstart guide (which basically says, “Plug it in. Download the app.”) This year, Google has designed a range of new hardware. Google Wifi follows the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones, the Google Daydream VR headset and Google Home smart speaker. If you’ve been tracking these products then you’ll know what a great job the company has done in their industrial design. Google Wifi is no exception. The compact, ice-white puck is perhaps my favourite design from the crop of new Home WiFi systems hitting the market this year. It’s certainly taller than eero (if a little narrower) but much more diminutive than the vase-shaped NETGEAR Orbi. Like Google Home, the device is designed to blend into your home environment. It’s not entirely invisible, but the design is subtle enough to stand out. It’s a shame it’s not available with replacement covers, like Google Home (and Google OnHub). The device is intersected by a thin, horizontal groove which serves as a status light. It glows subtly when the device is powered on and can change colour from blue and white  to orange and on to red to announce any issues. Flip the device over and you’ll find the twin Gigabit Ethernet ports (one WAN, one LAN for the first Wi-fi point – two LAN for subsequent points) tucked away neatly with a USB-C port used for power. The reset button is located on the rear of the device. Two Ethernet ports is an improvement on this device’s predecessor, Google OnHub, but behind the four ports equipped on Amplifi HD (see our review). It’s likely you’ll need a network switch at some point if you’re using smart home hubs for devices like Sonos, SmartThings or Philips Hue, so be sure to build that into your thinking when positioning the device. Importantly, as we discussed in the first part of this review, those Ethernet ports are enabled for backhaul duties, which should enhance network speeds across the mesh. Overall it’s a Google Wifi offers a simple design, but care has been taken to ensure the devices remain as neat and unobtrusive as possible. 1 2 3Next page amplifi hd eero google onhub google wifi mesh netgear orbi Terry Walsh Terry Walsh is the founder of We Got Served.

I DO have Ethernet throughout the house, but that has left the problem of connectivity with wireless-only devices — namely, phones and tablets — but also with laptops which could, conceivably, be wired, but are much more convenient when used wirelessly. I’ve tried Ethernet-wired access points and followed instructions for setup from the manufacturers as well as authorities listing cookbook approaches in forums, but I have always ended up with my printers (wired) and some other connected devices, like my Windows Home Server, on “different sides” of the network from tablets and phones, inaccessible. I’m not a computer pro, let alone a networking professional, so I’ve made little headway with my problems. I think that a Google On-Hub router with wired Google Wi-Fi mesh extenders will finally, after years of fretting and finagling, give me the system for which I’ve been searching for what feels like eons. Thanks, Terry, for this fabulous review! Reply Terry Walsh says: Dec 19, 2016 at 2:34 pm Happy to have helped, Ron – best of luck with the new network! Reply PM says: Dec 19, 2016 at 9:01 pm Hi Terry, best review I’ve seen on Google WiFi, a lot of great info. I currently have a Asus OnHub as the main router connected to three Google Wifi units. Works quite well. After seeing your review about wired backhaul from the Google WiFi units I’d like to give it a try. My dilemma is that Ethernet cables or Moca in my house is not an option and was wondering if I could use some gigabit powerline adapters for the wired backhaul? Thanks Paul Reply Terry Walsh says: Dec 19, 2016 at 9:06 pm Hey Paul – really glad that you enjoyed the read. You *could* try Powerline adapters, but to be honest, I think you’ll probably get better performance from wireless backhaul. Powerline can be pretty flaky depending on your home wiring. Reply PM says: Dec 19, 2016 at 9:14 pm Thanks for the reply. I think I’ll keep it the way it is, no reason to fix something that isn’t broken in the first place. Happy Holidays! Reply Zeronothing says: Dec 19, 2016 at 11:06 pm Hi Terry, I enjoyed the review. I have a question for you. Will the Google Wifi or OnHub still function without internet? So say one day my ISP goes out during the day, will I still have local access? I was reading about Eero mesh routers and how if you don’t have internet connectivity that they will not function. Well let me correct myself, if your eero is up and running and had connectivity before you lost internet, local access will still function. I was told by eero support that if you reboot the routers after you lost connectivity that when the routers come back online you will not have local network access functionality. Eero support mentioned they are working on “persistent” networking capabilities? have you done any of that kind of testing on the Google Wifi or Onhub devices? Reply e90n54 says: Dec 20, 2016 at 1:08 am I get pretty good results when connected to the Ethernet port. http://beta.speedtest.net/result/5895400602 http://beta.speedtest.net/result/5895413962 Reply Aaron Booker says: Dec 20, 2016 at 3:43 pm I deeply appreciate your research and testing. I have a problem in that I must have multiple SSID’s (at least two, but three is better) on my networks. We have a renter in our basement, and have two duplexes we rent and want their traffic separate and private though sharing the internet connection. We use one SSID for each “home” in the duplex, and one SSID for the smart home gear (nest thermostats/protects and Wink equipment (managing schlage smart locks, light switches, etc) with Kuna light/cameras. I love having one SSID across all three physical homes for smart home gear as it makes it easy to move gear around or set things up at my house and drop them in the other homes. Also makes it easy for my wife and our cleaners to have their internet “just work” at all three homes. We have MoCA in two of the three houses. Currently using either two routers or gear from Open-Mesh (Cloudtrax for management) in the homes. I would love to switch to Google WiFi for performance/simplicity but the multiple SSID’s is the hold up. With my need for multiple SSIDs what would you recommend? Does the Orbi support that? I would love to stick with ethernet for backhaul, but Google won’t work for me. I’ve been patiently waiting for multiple SSIDs in vain… 🙁 Reply Terry Walsh says: Dec 20, 2016 at 5:46 pm Hi Aaron – all of these home WiFi systems are built with simplicity in mind. None of them are really going to be able to deliver what you’re looking for. They’re all single SSID (+ guest network) but you really need a device that allows you to manage multiple SSIDs and subnets. Really, your needs are more typical of a small business setup! Reply Brady Case says: Dec 24, 2016 at 1:22 pm Terry, it seems like a number of the other mesh systems — Luma, Eero, and Plume as well as Google Wifi — also allow wired backhaul. Do recommend Google over the others for this application? I am weighing one of these mesh systems with wired backhaul versus POE WAPs. I live in a recently renovated home with ethernet jacks, and, though I have almost no networking knowledge, I chanced it a couple of years ago and installed Ubiquiti Unifi APs with a Ubiquiti POE router. It was a little scary getting it going, but then it ran without a thought or hiccup for two years straight, until I turned on the automatic firmware updates on the APs, and they all died. My efforts to troubleshoot with Ubiquiti about this were pointless and infuriating, and since they were out of warranty, Ubiquiti didn’t bother to respond to my emails. It’s a little hard to buy more Unifi’s after that experience, and with young kids at home I would like some of the parental control features of the consumer mesh systems, but I wonder if you think I should swallow my pride and stick with Unifi APs. Reply Brady Case says: Jan 1, 2017 at 6:32 pm FYI, I posted a similar question on thewirecutter’s review of mesh products. One responder reported that switching from a Ubiquity Unifi setup with 3 AC Pro access points to 3 Google Wifi units with wired backhaul yielded improved range and speed. I’m surprised but excited to give it a try whenever GWifi starts shipping again. Reply Joseph Morgan says: Dec 25, 2016 at 3:02 pm So, for a two story home with the modem coming in to the lower level, would you recommend the Google WiFi (3 positions) or two Onhub units (1 up and 1 down)? Sounds like it would be pretty much a wash. House is not wired throughout. Reply Terry Walsh says: Dec 25, 2016 at 8:30 pm Whichever is cheaper, TBH. Two OnHubs would provide ample coverage and would be slightly faster with faster wireless clients. But, you may find a single device covers you in a two storey home. I’d start with an Onhub and then add a second device if needed. Reply Joediver says: Dec 26, 2016 at 12:06 pm Thanks Terry, Happy Holidays! Reply Patrick Barnes says: Dec 26, 2016 at 3:20 am Great review Terry. I’m running a mesh of 3 ASUS OnHubs and things are pretty great. It’s just as fast as the ASUS RT-AC5300 for me (500mbit synchronous Ethernet). My only issue is finicky band steering where devices get pushed onto 2.4 Ghz for no reason and get stuck there. I have to toggle the wifi off/on on the device and then I get 5 Ghz again. I think this is a firmware bug, but I’m not sure. Reply HTee says: Dec 26, 2016 at 7:38 pm Pricing aside, would you recommend google wifi over eero? Also, were your tests conducted with eero 2.0 firmware? Great review by the way! Reply Terry Walsh says: Dec 26, 2016 at 7:43 pm Thanks! The eero review I did was firmware 1.x. Performance was similar, but the way you frame the question highlights the issue – price. I found eero to be less stable than Google WiFi, so there are a couple of reasons I’d take GW over eero. Reply Anonymous says: Jan 23, 2017 at 6:32 am thanks for the awesome review, this indeed is exactly what i am looking for, but i have a single question router is connected to WAN and chained to port1 of node1, node1 port2 is connected to node2 port1 will that work ? having node one connecting the router with the furthest node2 Reply Terry Walsh says: Jan 23, 2017 at 6:40 am Yes, you can connect the second node using either port. Reply Anonymous says: Jan 23, 2017 at 6:46 am and i noticed that the radio speeds are 1200, how much is that effect compared to the 1900, 2600 that regular routers offers ? i have wired connections, but would love the hassle free setup/managment for all the nodes in my network Reply Terry Walsh says: Jan 23, 2017 at 6:50 am The charts include a comparison with the AC 1900 Google OnHub. It’s a little faster with the fastest wireless clients, but not by much. Reply Ahmad Alrasheed says: Jan 23, 2017 at 7:25 am thanks for the answers terry, 1 last question does the OnHub integrate with the google wifi ? single SSID, shows up in the mesh app, and activate the guest network Reply Terry Walsh says: Jan 23, 2017 at 7:27 am Yes, it does. It’s all mentioned in the review. Reply Joe says: Jan 31, 2017 at 2:52 pm did you connect the mesh Onhub to ethernet via LAN or WAN? WAN has been shown to slow down ethernet backhaul speed. Reply Terry Walsh says: Jan 31, 2017 at 3:32 pm To the LAN port. I haven’t heard of the issue you mentioned, but hopefully it can be addressed in an update. Reply Koob says: Feb 21, 2017 at 2:49 pm Is it possible to connect a switch to the Orbi satellites or Google’s Wifi secondary points to connect more than four wired devices? Reply Remy says: Apr 17, 2017 at 8:28 pm Hi I was WO daring which would you recommend? Getting rid of current ISP router and then getting three google WiFi nodes. Or getting rid of ISP router and getting an onhub and two google WiFi nodes or getting two more on hubs instead?

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 April 2017 | MYT 7:00 AM Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles Google wants to help you turn your illegible doodles into works of art. — Google AutoDraw, a new web-based tool from Google, aims to make drawing – drawing well, that is – more accessible by using machine learning to give your doodles a boost.  The free tool – Google's latest AI Experiment – works on phones, computers and tablets, pairing machine learning with drawings created by artists, designers and illustrators.  A video explains, "Your phone can help you do anything fast. It just can't help you draw something simple fast." Want to make a quick party flyer, for example? "Where do you even go for that? You probably have to download some app or buy a design program."    AutoDraw – "a drawing tool for the rest of us" – was created with this issue in mind.  To make such a flyer, or a poster, or any other drawing, go to the AutoDraw site and start doodling. Draw something that looks like a cake, for example, and a suggestion tool will offer pre-existing drawings of a cake for you to choose from.  When you're in the mood to create drawings all your own, turn off the suggestion tool and doodle away.   Try it at www.autodraw.com.  For the more artistically inclined, find out how to submit your own drawings at www.autodraw.com/artists. — AFP Relaxnews Related Stories You May Be Interested Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles Could Apple buy Disney?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares253 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine.

Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

He wasn't telling you to google that phrase, that is what google says when they release a new build of android. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. If it compiles, it's ready. No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Disappeared? You're just not worth the time. But I came here to get a link and noticed your reply. So... Someone tell this guy he's a big fat liar: support dot google dot com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg This Google fanboy is a big fat liar, too: highonandroid dot com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Here's that liar's video. He must have hacked the video to support his lies about there being a halo problem. www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=GUjhM2xcKSY whispy_snippet Yes, so as I've agreed many times now, there is a halo effect that sometimes (very rarely) occurs when shooting with the Pixel in specific circumstances. But I see you've conveniently ignored the chromatic aberation and purple flaring I pointed out in the G6 images. No surprises there. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows.

However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving. The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. whispy_snippet Yep, no response. Thought so. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Jordan L I'll say that I snap a lot of photos with my Pixel XL.. I have seen the lens flare issue when there is direct full sun at a certain angle on the lens. Rare, but fun to reproduce for Pixel haters. Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling. "Can't" jacob grammar mistake not a spelling mistake :) PoisonApple31 I didn't say it was a spelling mistake. I said missing your apostrophe made you look stupid when you were talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! So the solution to fingerprint sensor problems is not to use it. Check. Adam Margeson No issues here and I use mine all the time! whispy_snippet Ditto. Alex Cruz Off topic but this 'Felonious Monk' guy seems like he's butt hurt over some shit hahaha Is like an ex-wife trying to 'I told you so' about some shit. Felonious Monk get some pussy bro, it helps with that butt hurt you got..... Fakhri Ahmad Microsoft should come in hard with new phones and entice all the users android has frustrated. Now's the time to try out a different OS DragoCubed Windows 10 mobile? Nope. It ain't happening. Though once Microsoft is done fiddling with full windows... DragoCubed Oh you, classic Google. This is why we hate... I mean love you. LOL Pixel XL and Nexus 5x, haven't noticed this issue Pris p I'm getting an iPhone next time. I'm tired of having boot loop worries and my videos looking all pixelized on social media. I haven't even downloaded the update because I'm afraid. It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years. Apple products(ipad excluded) are nice looking pieces of shit. Marco Antonio Maza Hernández What is going on with android? every update brings a new problem. mattcoz Has anybody had this problem in the final 7.1.2 release and not had it in the 7.1.2 beta?

Version 4.30.0 of Google Maps for iOS is now available, and it adds a Directions widget that you can access from the lock screen or by swiping over from the Notification Center when your phone is unlocked. As its name suggests, the Directions widget will show you the directions of a trip that you’ve started, complete with your next step and some arrows so that you can move forward through your trip if you’d like. Also included in today’s update is an iMessage app for Google Maps. This simple iMessage app will show you your current location on Google Maps and let you send it to your iMessage chat mates, all without leaving iMessage. Google says that version 4.30.0 of Google Maps for iOS also includes bug fixes. This is a nice little update for Google Maps for iOS. Not only does it give you a quick way to access your turn-by-turn directions without you having to keep Google Maps open, but it also makes it super easy to share your location in iMessage. So if you rely on Google Maps to get you around, you should go grab this update from the App Store now.

The updated navigation app now comes with a Directions Widget that gives users turn-by-turn navigation directions straight from the lock screen of their handsets. Hence, users will not need to unlock their iPhone and open the app just to obtain instructions for their destination.  To enable this functionality, users should head to the Today View of the Notification Center upon installing the update. From there, users should look for the Edit button then enable Google Directions. This will turn on the navigation directions which will be displayed on the Directions Widget that is found on the Notification Center. To access the widget, users should swipe right on the lock screen, according to MacRumors. READ: Google scraps Save Your Parking feature from Maps app Apart from the new widget, the Google Maps update also comes with a new iMessage support feature. What this does is basically enable users to send their location details to family and friends without having to leave the Messages app for the iPhone. It then saves time and effort, especially when users want to send their current location details to others as quickly as possible. The feature can be activated via the Messages App Store once version 4.30.0 is installed, as per Apple Insider. As expected, the new version of Google Maps comes with unspecified bug fixes that improve the performance of the app. Google is slowly rolling out this update, users are advised to check iTunes if the update is already available in their region. They may also download the app online for free.  Google is rolling out a new version of its Google Maps app for iOS devices.

 Google says rogue vendor violated guidelines by instructing contractors to rate InfoWars as untrustworthy site Maxwell Tani Apr. 17, 2017, 7:03 PM 15,841 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alex Jones. YouTube/screengrab Google said Monday that a vendor mistakenly told staffers working for the search engine that InfoWars should be ranked as a low-quality site. The prominent right-wing website — which has been known to stoke conspiracy theories — blasted Google on Monday after pro-Trump media personality Mike Cernovich shared screenshots that showed a Google contractor saying InfoWars should be rated as a "low-to-medium" reliable site since its stories are "often debunked." A Google representative appeared to confirm the validity of Cernovich's report, linking Business Insider to his Medium post. A vendor hired by Google employs contractors to rate the websites that appear in its search results — the rating is used to improve search quality, helping Google's automated search algorithm prioritize higher-rated, reliable information. In examining how the staffers working as website "raters" should evaluate a "rather poor site," the contractor pointed to InfoWars, advising raters to consider the quality of the information and its reputation. Google's representative distanced the company from the contractor's instructions, telling Business Insider that it does not instruct quality raters how to grade specific websites, but gives general rules to get unbiased feedback to improve the algorithm. "In this instance, we have confirmed that a vendor we work with sent out more detailed instructions to some raters without our knowledge, which included references to specific sites," the representative said. "This is in conflict with the intent of our guidelines and the vendor has taken action to remove these references in their training module." The rating incident with InfoWars involved Google's general web-search engine, which pulls results from across the web. That's different from Google News, which features only publications that have been preapproved as trustworthy by special staff. Earlier this year, Google explained how more than 10,000 quality rating contractors use a 200-page guideline book to evaluate information for Google search. "We’re explicitly avoiding the term 'fake news,' because we think it is too vague," said Paul Haahr, a senior Google engineer who is involved with search quality. "Demonstrably inaccurate information, however, we want to target." InfoWars was up in arms over the news on Monday. Cernovich appeared on founder Alex Jones' show, where he called for peaceful protests outside Google. A self-proclaimed "new right" media personality, Cernovich has become one of the most prominent pro-Trump new media personalities, branding himself as a provocateur unafraid to engage with enemies, promote conspiracy theories, and share controversial opinions about gender and identity politics. Last year he stoked rumors about Hillary Clinton's health issues and propagated the disproven conspiracy theory that Washington, DC, restaurant Comet Ping Pong was the site of a child sex ring. Still, in the past several weeks, Cernovich has broken legitimate news stories about the new administration. Cernovich reported on Medium that former national-security adviser Susan Rice requested the names of Trump associates whose communications were incidentally collected, a report later verified by Bloomberg View columnist Eli Lake. The report earned Cernovich a hat tip from President Donald Trump's senior counselor, Kellyanne Conway, and Donald Trump Jr., who said he deserved a Pulitzer Prize.

The company has not officially announced the launch of the service yet, but as you can see the home page is live for everyone to see. Everything beyond the home page appears to be locked at the moment. I tried signing in with my Google account, only to be told that my email address is not associated with a Google account. I guess that’s Google’s way of locking people out until the service officially launches. Multiple sources claim Google Hire will be a recruitment tool which allows employers to manage job applications. Employers will be able to place ads for job listings, which jobseekers will then be able to apply for. The fact that the service requires individuals to sign in using their Google account has led to concerns that recruiters will be able to see an applicant’s entire search history. While that could technically be a possibility, it also feels like people are jumping to the worst case scenario in an attempt to create clickbait headlines. No one knows for sure the extent of the permissions that will have to be granted in order to use the service. I have reached out to Google for more information and will update this story if and when I receive a response.

Not only is the company being fined $7.8 million USD, but it has agreed to allow the pre-installation of third-party apps. This move will make room for apps like the the local Russian search engine Yandex NV. The decision is the conclusion of a year and a half long case. In October 2015, Russia’s Federal Anti-Monopoly Service ruled that Google violated the country’s anti-monopoly laws. The regulators demanded that Google alter its agreements with mobile device producers in order to enable the installation of third-party apps. Google had been appealing the decision prior to the recent settlement. Google’s commercial settlement with Yandex is separate from its legal settlement with the regulator. Google will develop a “choice window” for its Chrome browser on existing devices so that users will be able to choose their preferred browser. They are also working on a Chrome widget for future devices. These developments will help Google to fulfill their obligation to “not to restrict pre-installation of any competing search engines and applications.” Yandex currently holds a 55 percent share of the search market in Russia, while Google clings to a 40 percent share. Yandex has nevertheless argued that its share in the market has been steadily declining due to Android devices. After the recent settlement, Yandex’s shares jumped by 7% to $24.35 in Moscow and rose even higher on Wall Street. Google has also been battling with the European Union over over allegations of monopolistic behavior. Google has been accused of exclusively promoting its own shopping services and edging out the competition. The EU wants to prevent the company from pressuring smartphone makers if they feel compelled to ignore other operating systems, however, Google has responded that the accusations are largely unfounded. Yandex, as well as FairSearch, Disconnect, and Aptoide, are also involved in this case. There is currently no resolution.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 30 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 68 Share on Twitter Total Shares190 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Damodara Kovie [dkovie] ...bruh, that's a bit much 🙄 Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. needa This is from the current 30th Legislature (2017-2018) Sec. 42.20.310. Eavesdropping. (a) A person may not (1) use an eavesdropping device to hear or record all or any part of an oral conversation without the consent of a party to the conversation; (2) use or divulge any information which the person knows or reasonably should know was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device for personal benefit or another's benefit; (3) publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has heard through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device; (4) divulge, or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of any conversation the person has become acquainted with after the person knows or reasonably should know that the conversation and the information contained in the conversation was obtained through the illegal use of an eavesdropping device. (b) In this section "eavesdropping device" means any device capable of being used to hear or record oral conversation whether the conversation is conducted in person, by telephone, or by any other means; provided that this definition does not include devices used for the restoration of the deaf or hard-of-hearing to normal or partial hearing. Notice how it only says 'a party to the conversation'. You don't even need to tell the person you are recording. Learjet Agreed. Would be nice to use if you were a reporter doing an interview, otherwise, what else would it be used for? It announces to the receiver that it's recording the conversation, so there's no nefarious way of using it. I'm a heavy and longtime Google Voice user and I've never needed or used it. In fact, until I read this post, I kinda had forgotten about it. Robert Johnson This call may be monitored or recorded for quality assurance, training purposes, marketing data, leaks, foreign blackmail, or national security reasons. Learjet It announces to both parties that the conversation is being recorded, so you can't record someone without their knowledge, which is what is illegal (and rightfully so). Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android? I've even made a request for this: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705317 aRvInD Thanks for this., I am new to this. Can I voteup for this? Android Developer Yes, please upvote it. You can also create your own suggestions and bug reports there. Just remember to fill all the needed information, and add video/images when possible. Speaking of normal calls, I even requested to show larger image of the contact (because currently it's very small), but they rejected it: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36705104 :( aRvInD Ok, but how to upvote? I couldn't find any arrow marks to do it..! Android Developer You just press on the star icon on the left of the title: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/202f8e6fda93b600e49e3ff09414330dc50a6535e482df680ca66861015e1a45.png . You can also comment if you want to add something to what's written, but this doesn't count as upvoting. It's too bad the current UI of the website doesn't allow (or at least I can't find how to do it) to filter by requests. I'm sure many requests of developers and users can be interesting to upvote. Here's another one I made of a basic feature of a phone: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/37310901 It's to handle the annoying notifications of phone (audio) messages people leave you, and you have to call in order to listen and delete them. I prefer it all being managed on the smartphone itself. MikeJwF Hey look at that, a president was impeached/resigned for spying! Should be looked at as more of a trail blazer in hindsight. How ironic. prestonjb I guess this is why my voicemail was so messed up the last months... But now that it's working the is a larger problem... Now i wish I could get Google voice to get the voice mail from my Android Wear lg watch. I want to call forward my phone to my watch and then if I don't pick up on the watch then voice mail goes to Google voice.. but alas I can't get the watch to forward to Google voice.. Ailín Ó’S Non American here. Can someone explain to me the picture? SpeakethTheTruth Google the Watergate Scandal. Ailín Ó’S Enlightening. Cheers. Lucas Cannon Interesting Google Voice now opens with Project Fi. At least for me on my 5X... First time I've seen! Goodbye Hangouts! 😁 Lucas Cannon Nevermind... 😥 mcdonsco I've been wanting to port my number to GV but I'm REALLY worried about something going wrong during the port and losing my number. It's my business number which is tied to a LOT of advertising in addition to just previous/current clients spanning over a decade; would be a DISASTER for me ofming lost it. Anyone do the port from Verizon to GV recently that can share your experience? Amanasatree I'm in the same predicament as you, would love to know of others experience porting from Verizon toGV. Elaine L So that's what the problem was! I thought it was user error and lo, though I tried, I couldn't find those voice mails. Thanks, yer Mum.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Sploid Paleofuture io9 Science Reviews Field Guide No, Google Hire Won’t Share Your Search History With Employers Libby WatsonYesterday 6:22pm Filed to: Fake news privacy google 10 1 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: hire.withgoogle.com The perfect fake viral news story has two crucial elements: something outrageous that makes you real mad and something you could basically believe. Not like, “Donald Trump Decrees ‘All Dogs Are Boys,’” but like, “Donald Trump Nominates Steven Seagal as Secretary of Defense.” Advertisement That perfect storm of plausibility and heinousness seems to have been achieved today by a story concerning Google Hire, an upcoming Google site that will allow employers to post job listings and manage applications. Several outlets, including RT, an Australian news site, and experienced British shit-spreaders the Daily Mail and the Sun, ran stories on Monday suggesting that the recently revealed jobs site would allow employers to see users’ search history. The sites based that claim on the fact that users would sign in with their personal Google accounts, which contain information on search history and YouTube viewing habits, unless those features are turned it off. RT, for example, said the news “prompted fears that employers could be able to access your search history and Youtube subscriptions,” and the Daily Mail claimed that “several news reports suggest this will allow recruiters to access your entire search history,” without citing any specific sources. Advertisement This doesn’t seem to be the case at all. Speaking to Gizmodo, a Google spokesperson said, “Only information that a candidate voluntarily provides would be passed to a prospective employer as part of their online application. Private information will not be shared.” When asked specifically if it would be possible for a potential employer to accidentally see a user’s search history, the spokesperson clarified: “Google does not share private information such as search or viewing history. Only the information that applicants input into Google Hire will be shared—for example, first name, last name, email address, resume, cover letter, etc.” However, you can’t entirely blame readers for spreading this news. When Congress voted to repeal rules on broadband privacy a couple weeks ago, people were freshly reminded of how fucked we are when it comes to keeping our information safe online. And Google has a lot of information about you, as does Facebook, and maybe Twitter, and definitely your ISP. Given these legitimate causes for concern, it’s not surprising that a spooky horror story about internet privacy would pick up steam. It’s vital that consumers let companies know they’re concerned about these issues, but false stories like this don’t help anyone, so try not to freak out too much—at least this time.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares253 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

He wasn't telling you to google that phrase, that is what google says when they release a new build of android. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. If it compiles, it's ready. No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. thereasoner There's a petition for you guys to sign online but so far only 156 have done so and probably half of those are just haters without a Nexus or Pixel. Seems to me that the issues are isolated. Bruce Wayne Yeah, that must be it. You're not experiencing it so half of us are just haters and the issues are isolated. Yup, that's it. Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Disappeared? You're just not worth the time. But I came here to get a link and noticed your reply. So... Someone tell this guy he's a big fat liar: support dot google dot com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg This Google fanboy is a big fat liar, too: highonandroid dot com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Here's that liar's video. He must have hacked the video to support his lies about there being a halo problem. www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=GUjhM2xcKSY whispy_snippet Yes, so as I've agreed many times now, there is a halo effect that sometimes (very rarely) occurs when shooting with the Pixel in specific circumstances. But I see you've conveniently ignored the chromatic aberation and purple flaring I pointed out in the G6 images. No surprises there. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. whispy_snippet Yep, no response. Thought so. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Jordan L I'll say that I snap a lot of photos with my Pixel XL.. I have seen the lens flare issue when there is direct full sun at a certain angle on the lens. Rare, but fun to reproduce for Pixel haters. Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap.

And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here.

The update brings the app to version 4.30.0 and includes a pair of notable changes to the user interface as Google works to better compete with the integration offered throughout iOS by Apple Maps. Mujjo Wallet iPhone 7 Case First off, Google Maps today gains support for a new Directions widget. This, Google touts, allows you to access your directions anywhere in iOS from the Today View. For instance, if you’re on the lock screen, you can swipe to the left to view directions from Google Maps. Previously, Google Maps directions were only displayed in-app and via push notifications, but this update makes it even easier to keep up with directions to wherever you may be headed. Secondly, today’s update adds Google Maps integration with iMessage. With the new iMessage app, you can instantly send your location to someone, allowing them to quickly find directions and travel times. This feature addition comes as Google Maps earlier gained real-time location sharing. The iMessage app, however, only supports static location sharing, meaning it doesn’t constantly update like what’s offered on Android by Google Maps and on iOS by Apple’s “Find My Friends” app. Below is the full change log for today’s Google Maps update: What’s New in Version 4.30.0 Get turn-by-turn navigation right on your lock screen with the new Directions widget Use the new iMessage app to send your static location to contacts without leaving the conversation Bug fixes Over recent months, Google has gradually been rolling out new features to the Google Maps app on iOS. The updates have mainly centered around making it quicker and easier to access Google Maps throughout the operating system, something that is somewhat challenging for third-party applications. On the other hand, Apple Maps is heavily integrated throughout iOS. For instance, Google Maps recently gained “Nearby Transit” and “Travel Times” widgets, as well as support for popular times details and a “Nearby Traffic” widget. The latest version of Google Maps for iOS is available on the App Store for free. Chance Miller @ChanceHMiller Chance covers Apple for 9to5Mac and contributes to 9to5Google, Electrek, and 9to5Toys.

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

The widget can be enabled by going to the Today View of the Notification Center, scrolling down to the "Edit" button, and then enabling Google Directions. Once turned on, turn-by-turn navigation directions will be available through the widget in the Notification Center, which can be accessed by swiping right on the lock screen. Today's update also introduces a new Google Maps iMessage app that's designed to let users send their current location to friends and family members without the need to leave the Messages app. The new Google Maps Messages app can be enabled through the Messages App Store. When installed, it establishes the user's location and then allows that information to be shared right in Messages. Along with the new widget and Messages app, the new version of Google Maps also includes unspecified bug fixes. Google Maps can be downloaded from the App Store for free.

Remember that the whole reason Apple ended up doing their own maps instead of just sticking with Google is because Google refused at the time to allow turn by turn directions on iOS and also demanded the ability to serve ads and get customer info, which Apple refused to provide. It's not "foolishness" on Apple's part to refuse to make a privacy-compromising exception to their own rules for a single company, and it certainly isn't Apple's fault that Google tried to build in a competitive edge for another platform. I'm personally very happy Apple went through the trouble and tremendous expense rather than freely opt everyone into Google's data harvesting. If you want to give your info to Google, fine but I would expect it to be completely opt-in with no gray area, and Apple doesn't have to provide a vehicle for their biggest competitor.

Any mention of Google on this forum inevitably leads to someone moaning about privacy. Before doing so, I wish people would actually read Apple's privacy policy. If they did, they'd see that Apple and Google collect and use your information, personal and non-personal, in the exact same ways; including advertising. It's all right there for anyone who wants to discern fact from fiction. And just like with Google, any desire to bypass data mining is an opt-out situation, not opt-in. I agree with you completely about opt-in, btw. I wish they all (Apple, Google, MS, etc.) were opt-in. They're not. They're pretty much all opt-out. To single out one seems disingenuous when they're all doing the same thing.

Hangouts on Android will remove SMS support on May 22 Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/03/23 6:21pm PDTMar 23, 2017 402 Plus 1 on G+ 420 Share on Facebook 129 Share on Twitter Total Shares951 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/03/24 10:16am PDT Google has confirmed that Project Fi users will not be impacted, and can continue to send and receive SMS and calls through Hangouts. Once upon a time, I was able to get most of my communication done through Hangouts. Between its support for standard SMS, Google Voice, and normal Hangouts conversations, it was an incredibly useful tool. It could even merge SMS and Hangouts conversations into the same thread, much like iMessage on the iPhone. Over the past year or so, Google has been separating all this functionality into standalone apps. Google started asking SMS users to switch to Messages, then removed merged conversations, and finally launched a new separate Google Voice app. The company has also been trying to move people off Hangouts itself, with its new Allo and Duo apps. Now Google appears to be finally pulling the trigger on Hangouts' SMS integration. In an email sent out to G Suite administrators, Google said that a warning (pictured above) will appear to Hangouts users starting March 27. The email also says that SMS support will be completely removed from Hangouts on May 22. The message states that Google Voice users will not be affected, but with all the improvements in the standalone Voice app, you might be better off switching anyways. No changes were announced for SMS integration with Project Fi, which allows texts and calls to go through Hangouts, but I'm almost certain that it will stay (at least as long as Voice integration does). Thanks: Dan, Joff Download: Google Hangouts (Play Store) Update 1: 2017/03/24 10:16am PDT Google has confirmed that Project Fi users will not be impacted, and can continue to send and receive SMS and calls through Hangouts.

Now I want to uninstall this app from my phone selw0nk At least I can still use Google Voice. Picaso86 I'm using Hangouts as my primary phone number, this is going to affect me...I have a weird feeling.. duke69111 So this is the SMS integration from your carrier correct? Not the text messaging ability from from my google voice number? Corbin Davenport Correct. Donny Stanley But this begs the question then, if there's already a dedicated app for Google Voice messaging, and you'll need to use another app completely for standard carrier SMS, then why use Hangouts at all? Google makes me so angry. duke69111 I personally really like using Hangouts for messages. I use SMS very little. Corbin Davenport At least in my case, I still use Hangouts because it works fine. Allo still doesn't have a desktop client. Régis Knechtel That's what they want! From now on, to make people stop using it, except the ones who use it for busines. duke69111 Thanks. aNYthing6 Google almost had it with Hangouts. Now their "solution" to messaging is just a complete mess. What a shame. Trooper311 Their solution is to have a bunch of different apps that all suck worse than Hangouts. GG Google! Sean Thomas I mean, hangouts was always slow and janky and confusing with all the different things you could do. Google doesn't need to be in the business of a proprietary messaging platform like whatsapp or imessage. Allo needs to go next. At least Duo does something interesting. voice and google messages are good for their own things. It's not like everyone you know is ever going to be on a single app for messaging anyway. Your phone has notifications so everything goes to the same place anyway. My point is...it doesn't matter that Google is always changing their messaging stuff. At least not that much to most people. lol b_freeman The reason it doesn't matter to "most" people is because they use whatever​ default SMS app comes on their phone and maybe downloads Snapchat also. They don't care if the app is decent looking or if it has a desktop client. Unfortunately the audience on this site is in the minority of users. Premsuraj That may be true in the US market. But everywhere else people only care about Whatsapp, no other messaging app can come close. That is because everyone they know is using it. Romek Nowak Not really. Facebook is more popular in my country - Poland. I imagine a bunch of EU countries (and the US!) are the same. Henrik Cole I was paid 104000 dollars last 12 month period by doing a web-based task as well as I was able to do it by w­orking in my own time f­o­r quite a few hours regularly. I applied work opportunity I stumbled upon on-line and therefore I am thrilled that I was succeed to earn such decent money. It is undoubtedly newbie-friendly and therefore I am so blessed that I discovered out about it. Read through exactly what I do... http://libr.ae/y49h Marcelove Which is the owner of WhatsApp... To fix it at your point of view: "But everywhere else people only care about messaging apps from Facebook" Romek Nowak They aren't the same. In fact most of the premise behind them is different. b_freeman That's all fine and good for the EU but I'm concerned about the US mobile market and in the US most carrier's provide unlimited text and picture messaging or very close to it with most plans that they offer, so unless the carrier's start downplaying SMS it isn't going to die in the US anytime soon. Romek Nowak Not to mention that a small portion of them actually had Hangouts set as their default SMS app out of the box. Now they have to choose something else... Unless they never connected to the Play Store, in which case they won't be affected. Francesdvargas Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Vratislav Jindra How was Hangouts "confusing with all the different things you could do"? It is a very robust instant messaging app with all the functionality anyone might need. Even my parents learned how to use it, how to send messages, photos and videos and how to make voice and video calls - and they're not exactly tech savvy people. Are you an iPhone user? Or what's wrong with you, when you're saying that Hangouts is confusing to you? Is there a particular function you don't understand? Or are you just one of the people because of who Google decided to launch tons of apps (Allo, Duo, Messenger,...) with limited features which struggle to be able to do what Hangouts already can? makapav Hangouts should have continued it's evolution to be single point of messaging. Ability to reach the intended party via SMS, Hangouts, Voice whatever medium in a seamless single conversation transparent to the end users. Trooper311 Agreed with slow and janky. But this app had pretty much everything a person could want all in one app. Now that they are taking away SMS it is just going to piss a lot of people off. For me I would much rather have one app that most people I know have on their phones already. Google is just creating a huge clusterf*ck by creating all of these different messaging apps. James Donut They (google) will have to find a way to merge Carrier dependent messaging (RCS/SMS) with their Google Account based Hangouts.. Right now they are separate cadtek91 Carriers want a standalone messaging SMS app. This was a reason they made Google Messenger back when it launched with 5.0. sproc Messenger is just a LP look to the SMS app. You might as well just call it what it was called, Messages. HSidhu Carriers don't want a separate messaging app for iPhones?? lol Fadakar They honestly never got a say. By ATT caving to Apple's demands early on set the tone for what future carriers could get away with by the time the iPhone hit their networks. rohiggidy you mean the app everyone bashed 24/7 on here and other places now it was perfect Gabriele Molinarolo People were asking for improvements, not dismembering. reggjoo You're right. Their idea of the cure, is too make a mess, and confuse. Do no evil, bullgooglery! Trooper311 Agree. rohiggidy improvement when the app was super bloated? Max Yes, improvements. SyCoREAPER UPDATE for Project Fi Users Only: SyCoREAPER 11:30 AM I was hoping you could relay a message to another team as this directly affects my Project Fi experience. Alex11:30 AM What do you mean? SyCoREAPER 11:31 AM Hangouts ability to use SMS was crucial for my Project Fi existence and happiness. Some brain dead iphone user at Google has signed off on removing Hangouts ability to send and receive SMS SyCoREAPER 11:32 AM Hangouts was the only app that I was reliably receiving messages with on Fi Alex11:32 AM Project Fi users can still send SMS messages through Hangouts and will not be affected by these changes. catalysto Well you're quite a dickhead. SyCoREAPER Says the fuckface who called someone a dickhead over something that does not affect them. catalysto Doesn't make it any less true though. SyCoREAPER Are we talking about me or you because you are completely fucking failing. You're blocked for being so goddamn stupid. catalysto And you're a dickhead to the end. Seems like a good life strategy! David Agree. Anyone who mixed case letters in their username is a dickhead. parkerjh For such a smart company, how in the world can Google be so damn confused when it comes to messaging? They can't get out of their own way. It is just appalling. how bad they are and how confusing they make it for Android users to simply message. So frustrating. Duder12 They arent confused. Hangouts = Business Allo = Consumer It makes perfect sense and is targeting your users with the correct features instead of bloat. Android messenger is the wrench in the mix but i guarantee it's just a way to get OEMs to jump on RCS. We will probably see RCS in Allo very soon and Pixel phones will no longer need Android Messenger and certainly will no longer need Hangouts. ClaudiuIO Wait you can send sms throuhg Allo? Why has nobody told me? /s Sachin Bahal You can't (yet), Google says SMS fallback is coming to Allo, soon™ Hypnotoad No, they specifically said they aren't designing a messaging app for 2010, implying they will never implement SMS fallback. Here's hoping they integrate RCS into it at least! Duder12 RCS has SMS fallback. Matt How about they design one for 2017 then, where most of the people I know use SMS. Josh Brown No product led said that is what messages is for. xanok Have a citation on this? I'll bet a week's pay that full fledged SMS support will never happen. mxwp pretty sure he was being sarcastic with the tongue in cheek trademark symbol zepy3 The devs for allow have consistently been against SMS support for Allo. Even if they do add RCS support (not likely at the moment imho), it has to be supported by the carrier making it completely useless to anyone on a carrier not running Google's flavor of RCS. Duder12 Wrong. It doesn't have to be Google's flavor and as it seems now ALL carriers are slowly coming on board zepy3 Maybe in Europe but not in the US. Also, yes it does have Google Jibe and while Google is pushing it strongly it's not going to be on 90% of carriers by the end of the year, it probably won't even be supported on Project Fi this year. Either way RCS is not SMS and it wasn't more than 10 to 14 days ago one of the lead devs said no SMS support because they're building an app "for the future". Corbin Davenport Using RCS on Android Messages works with more than just Google Jibe RCS. Google has also added support for Vodafone's RCS service. Impulse_Vigil AFAIK Tmo is the only one fully committed to a cross compatible RCS implementation. Duder12 Uh Sprint is already LIVE Impulse_Vigil It might've been Sprint then, point is neither of the two biggest carriers are on board. I get Google is trying to leverage them, but from the outside it looks pretty slow going. Duder12 ATT showed a demo using Android Messenger with RCS at MWC using their Network. It's happening. Michael Sørensen Only some of Europe. Most of northern Europe is still on SMS parkerjh they are confused and have changed messaging apps and developed so many concurrently that it is impossible for the consumer to know what to use. As a Google Voice user, who relied on Hangouts to merge my SMS, now I need to use two apps. Can't even select Voice as default. It is a god damn clusterfuck. MeCampbell30 Two apps! The horror! It's probably a violation of the Geneva convention, too! Get real man. parkerjh eh, it is not just the fact that two apps are required. It is how many messaging apps they have trotted out over the last five years while pushing one, then another, then Google Voice gets an update after half a decade of moribund development BUT don't get cozy with that....we have Allo for you! And later this year.....the new app to merge them all again. Then, pulled apart and they'll be another one next year. There is a reason iOS does messaging well. There has been one app. And it works. bekifft That's because they are viewing it from their perspective of the business goals they want to accomplish, rather than from a user experience perspective. Apple somehow usually manages to do both. Standard Google really. MeCampbell30 The only reason iOS messages app does well is because of the widespread use in the US. It's certainly not because of Apple's proprietary gloss on SMS. parkerjh Not true. Despite its own issues, Apple has a single app that a user can open on their phone, tablet or desktop and send SMS and MMS to individuals or groups of Apple or non Apple users. It is the only messaging solution that millions of iOS users need to accomplish all their messaging needs. Google/Android simply never has come close to something similar. Nothing to do with widespread adoption. Techngro Hangouts was actually exactly the same as what you described with the iOS app before this nonsense from Google. I've been using Hangouts for donkey's years as my standalone phone and messaging application, both on my phone, tablet AND on my desktop. It's literally the only way I communicate to both Google and non-Google users. I use it to call landlines and cell phones for free, I use it to text or MMS people (and groups) on any carrier. And they can do the same for me, with the added benefit that their call is routed to my mobile, tablet and house phone. This is a phenomenally boneheaded move by Google. At the very least, they should have had a replacement with all of the same functionality BEFORE cutting people off from Hangouts. I tried their Messanger app and it didn't seem to have the same functionality as Hangouts. There was no desktop app for example. The more I think about it, the more cheesed I am that a gigantic company like Google can't figure this out. It's not like they're inventing a whole new way to communicate. This has all been done before. JohnyNoLegs Yea! Screw user experience! Lets just give them 2 of everything as that seems to be fine! Mike Didn't put much thought into that reply did you? MeCampbell30 Look who's talking. Low effort post. makapav You asked for it and it's well served - hopefully roasted. Randroid Who needs consolidation, right? I mean, why do we have voicemail in the phone app? It should just be its own app! While we're at it, you don't need any sort of speed dial in the phone app either. Another app! Call history in a phone app? Nope. Makes sense to put it in its own app. What about being able to dial contacts right from the phone app? Nope. We don't need that either. Another app. If we did this, we would have about 5 apps on your phone to do what the phone app does. That's basically what you're proposing, but with messaging instead of phone. It's not the end of the world, and all of the functionality would be there, but the user experience would be terrible. MeCampbell30 The illusion of consolidation. If a task has a completely different context it's bad idea to mix those two contexts in a single app. Period. People don't need to browse Twitter and Snapchat in the same feed. People don't need voicemail to also provide a dialer. Not only does a focused app often have better code, it also tends to surface functionality much better than hiding it under tabs, sub-tabs, hamburger menus, and dropdown menus. That's the whole reason intents exist in the first place. If the voicemail app can't place your call, it can seamlessly pass the task to an app capable of handling it. The hangup with consolidation is borderline religious, it's bad UX and bad UI. Matt Sending text messages through data and SMS are completely different contexts? yann933 Yes! Please let SMS just die already. RCS will be supported on all devices soon, so we won't be needing SMS anymore. In the end it doesn't look to complicated of a setup for consumers. Android Messages for the bulk of your messaging needs, Allo for your Group messages, and Duo for your Video calling. Enterprise users, can use Hangouts Chat and Meet instead of Allo and Duo as well. Corbin Davenport RCS isn't a device issue, it's a carrier issue. It's going to be years before most carriers in the US switch to the Universal RCS Profile (if ever), and even then, I'll bet Apple has no interest in adding support for it to iOS. yann933 That's the only issue, we can only hope that Google might be able to rally up all the OEM's and Carriers to get RCS support working seamlessly and bug free, but the other side of the fence will just dig it's heels in and then we'll have quite the divide seeing as Google is going all in with RCS by the looks of it. Then we'll watch who moves first, Apple supporting RCS, or Google going back to SMS, neither seems very likely 😄 Midnitte The irony of course being that even with all the press from Google about RCS (e.g. the blog post about adding it to Messages), they still haven't setup an RCS server for Project Fi. senoredusty The big four are all in support of the UP, with Sprint already live, T-Mobile sometime soon (supposed to be early this year per the CTO), AT&T demoing at MWC...Why so negative at the prospect? Duder12 Because any Google innitatives are hated apparently. Everyone thinks they make billions every quarter off Android. When in reality Apple does in a day what Google does in month of handset / PlayStore profits newtonfb AP for some reason is very negative when it comes to the topic of RCS and I'm going to guess it stems from David because the rest are scared to disagree with him besides Ryan. All the networks have said and showed they will support UP soon. The only one being Verizon but they have sign on to support it. bekifft Read his post about it to see why. Basically each network operator is implementing incompatible versions. Universal RCS is what we need but as usual the operators have their heads so far up their asses they can't see that it would be mutually beneficial to have a universal standard, they see it like they do everything else, as a proprietary value add. senoredusty What are you talking about? All US carriers are on board. bekifft Yes, with INCOMPATIBLE VERSIONS. Read the article. http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/04/the-rcs-mirage-advanced-messaging-is-a-mess-in-the-us-and-googles-standard-is-just-one-more/ senoredusty No, literally all four major carriers are on board with the UNIVERSAL Profile. That doesn't mean they're *live* yet, but they will be. It's a negative article for entirely no reason. Yes, it's true that other carriers implemented different standards INITIALLY bekifft That's good then, I haven't read anything like that since I saw the article in question. Maybe good news doesn't spread as fast as bad. bekifft http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/11/04/the-rcs-mirage-advanced-messaging-is-a-mess-in-the-us-and-googles-standard-is-just-one-more/ newtonfb Ya no kidding. That was the article I was referring to. If you actual read it a ton has changed. Things are moving alot faster than anticipated xanok RCS is already available through some US carriers. bekifft Sadly I think Apple is the only hope for RCS. The only way we will ever see Universal RCS is when and if Apple does it. They are the only company in the world with the power to force the network operators to do anything. chri5 You think people are going to constantly change apps every time some bright spark at Google fancies a new app or removing functionality of an existing one? Nothing is as simple for users as an IM app that automatically falls back to SMS if either party has no data coverage Why don't Google get it What a shambles! Duder12 Apple has a patent on SMS fallback. That's why I see RCS coming to Allo someday since RCS has SMS fallback and avoids Apples patent h4rr4r So three apps to so what one can do now. Does allo have a desktop client yet? Impulse_Vigil So you're basing your counter point that they're not confused on A) a guess about future RCS support and B) ignoring Hangout's past... Yeah, no. I've used Hangouts, and I actually like/use Allo (because family members started to even tho they never took to Hangouts), shoot I even use Messages as well, and I'm not one of those people that feels a desperate need to pare down the # of apps they use... But I can't see how you can really argue Google's strategy has been very confused and scattered over time. It might appear clearer now, but the whole RCS thing is still up in the air and they're just as likely to jump to a whole new app if Allo's user base isn't there... I mean, why did they pivot away from Hangouts to begin with? Probably because users were bailing and the brand was damaged thru association with G+ or the silly name it had to begin with. And this is while ignoring Fi and Voice which only complicate matters. Josh Brown Google should make enough messaging apps so each of my contacts has their own app. John Camey Ridiculous. Lucas de Eiroz ™ Text: Google Talk > Hangouts > Allo SMS: Messages (AOSP) > Hangouts > Android Messages > [possibly] Allo Voice: Google Voice > Google Talk > Hangouts > Google Voice [again] > Duo Video: Google Talk > Hangouts > Duo All of the four categories were separated, and then Google put them together in Hangouts. Now, they are all being separated again. Yes, they are confused. JacobTheDev That's not even mentioning their other, less well known apps like Spaces. They just keep putting out more and more messaging apps. Honestly, all I want is something like iMessage for Android. I thought that's what Allo would be, but that didn't pan out. It's just a confusing mess. brolivar *hasn't panned out. We shall see what is announced at I/O. Besides, the Universal Profile for RCS - which is my theory for everything in the messaging landscape to change - isn't due until Q2 2017. bekifft Google users are getting as bad as Windows Phone users. With them it was always "the solution to everything is coming next year" now with us it's "just wait for I/O" and it's the same result with both. They just kick the can down the road to next year. I/O never solves anything. I/O is where you go to see the next set of products Google will abandon. bekifft Also, RCS requires network operator involvement, and as usual they are even more user hostile and short sighted than Google, so I wouldn't hold my breath on that one either. JacobTheDev Yea, RCS looks very promising, I just don't trust carriers to actually get on board. Hell, I'm a Project Fi subscriber, and even that doesn't support RCS! (I mean, it could be because not all of the carriers that Fi uses support RCS, but still). senoredusty Release 2. Release 1 is already available. Carriers don't need release 2 Ron Lunsford I'm going to play the Windows Phone game with t his one... Microsoft originally had their People Tile "App" baked into the OS. It was PHENOMENAL... They used the API's for Twitter, Facebook and Linked In, all popped through the system in one place. They did the same thing with Messaging - texts, FB Messenger, Skype, etc... Then the problem began... They needed to push an entire OS update to fix an API change with Facebook. Then another for Twitter's change. Then Messenger was separated, and they needed to program for that. It was a giant mess. Google is facing the same thing rolling everything into one App. They make one change in Allo and Voice no longer works. The tweak Hangouts and you lose incoming Voice calling. They try and make Duo video work through this or that and something else breaks. Eventually, they will find the one that most people like, but for most of the world, Google has already lost to WhatsApp, just like Skype did. There are still users on every platform, but soon, those will all be merged and become one user base with one App. At least that's where I think Google is headed - they just aren't sure which App and what the cost will be. rohiggidy bingoooo HSidhu *Android Messages (not messenger) :) Matthias Hangouts is already a highly integrated messaging solution. I mean, it has a decent phone app, it has its own web app and it is integrated into the Gmail (and Inbox) web apps as well. Allo is only a phone app, not integrated into anything. How is this offering "the correct features" to each group of users? Well, okay, I guess if they develop Allo further and integrate it with other services, make a web app and so on (for Duo as well), then I can kind of see Allo (and Duo) replacing Hangouts for consumers, while Hangouts can then be targeted more on business users... but they are sooo far away from that. Right now, what Google is doing just doesn't make any sense to me. trwnh The problem is that they gave up on unified messaging. The balkanization of Google messaging services and platforms was absolutely terrible from a strategy perspective. Things were perfect when I could use Hangouts+GV with MMS and merged conversations in 2015. That's gone now. Marcelove (Google's employee doing damage control) Zachary Dunn This is top notch confusion. You don't build a consumer product and then take it back from consumers and call it an enterprise product. Imagine them cutting off your access to Gmail or any other app and saying this is a business app now Really what they're doing is killing Hangouts the unified chat client and creating a new Slack clone and naming it Hangouts. These two products don't share anything except a name bekifft This is exactly the point that so many people seem to be deliberately missing. Chronos90 Allo still misses one major thing: desktop client. Whatsapp is for normals users too right? They have a good working client, it's not perfect because of the QR thing but still... Google would have a major advantage here: Google account auto login. John Hangouts = Business, unless you don't use it for business since it's included in Gmail for consumers Allo = Consumers Duo = Consumers Messenger = Consumers Voice = Consumers Matt RCS is a fucking mess and will never be a solution for anything unless there are some drastic changes that don't appear to be happening. bekifft Nope, I bet they go the other way. Messenger won't go away because the network operators demand it, and Google wants Allo around for more data mining. Hangouts was the last shot to properly integrate messaging and SMS. selonmoi Sure, so simple. But, oops! You missed Android Messages, Voice, and Duo. And you missed the fact that Hangouts has drawn in millions of consumer users over the past four years. Who are now losing functionality and being told to use at least four different apps that, together, still don't fully replace the functionality that Google promised for Hangouts over the years. It's a mess. Trooper311 Twas only a matter of time. Timmy Turner Sigh Josh Crumley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2d9a9862494e0d8914c7d71f9c72ce66307339f5ade768694cc730b295956a9a.gif Steve T. pretty much my reaction! :D mondeca I don't understand how Google benefits from this. I understand that removing features reduces the testing and maintenance overhead for products, but if they have to keep SMS integration for Fi customers, then they aren't even gaining this tiny benefit. Sam Del Valle http://www.themrblueprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/rip-google-hangouts-on-air.png Matt RIP = Ripped Into Pieces Pessimippopotamus YOU'RE DEAD TO ME GOOGLE. YOU HEAR ME? DEAD!!!

What's the target demo for those 2? Corbin Davenport Android Messages is just for SMS. Allo is (supposed to be) a WhatsApp competitor. Borgman Okay that's what I thought but wasn't sure. Thank you! duke69111 I think we need a chart to get all this straight. James Donut Allo, although Mobile # based, uses google internet services for medium and as well as the AI chat. While Messenger on the other hand is carrier based Borgman So when rcs comes out in a few years with both those apps support it? Or only Android Messages since it's carrier based, and rcs is basically sms except beefed up a bit?! Bill B I wonder if they'll have the Android Auto problem fixed by then. Currently, many Auto users can't use Google Assistant to respond to SMS messages if Hangouts is disabled. I experienced this problem myself and sure enough, enabling Hangouts fixed it. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/android-auto/Kxb3deoJU_Y;context-place=topicsearchin/android-auto/category$3Atroubleshoot%7Csort:relevance%7Cspell:false b_boogey_xl Why do I feel like the only one that saw this coming... BoFiS Booooo, Hangouts is still the best, with or without SMS, I just hope they don't kill it entirely since really NONE of the alternatives add up to as useful jonzey231 I'm sorry but this is utterly hilarious. Lol. I don't even get frustrated anymore. I just watch the ship sink a little more each time 😂 jonzey231 It's probably safe to assume they're weaning consumers off Hangouts by forcing them to use Messages. Maybe they've got all the major carriers on board and they're announcing universal RCS at I/O? Or maybe they're going to announce SMS integration in Allo? Duder12 Probably RCS for both. Corbin Davenport There's no such thing as "universal RCS." There's a Universal RCS Profile, which is what Google is endorsing, but each carrier has to add support for it individually. jonzey231 Jesus. I know. Lol. You're reading into it too much. I could've worded it better too. Maybe they're going to announce that multiple carriers have agreed upon a single or multiple interchangeable RCS profiles so nearly everyone here in the states can use it. Raiterio Patterson Google employee: How do we improve on Hangouts? Google engineer: take everything great people like about Hangouts, and make stand alone apps. Sundar: Genius! I love it! boop Each of those apps are far better at their single purpose than Hangouts was at doing everything, so maybe they're onto something. Matt Yeah, that's certainly the key to success in the future. People love specialized things and hate the convenience of 1 stop shopping. That's why places like Radioshack and Tower Records are putting Target and Walmart out of business. boop A false equivalence. When it comes to browsing, casual users want breadth where as more discerning users want depth. When it comes to taking action, it's a matter of simplicity vs complexity. More enthusiast users may want their apps filled to the brim with features whereas the casual user generally wants to just press the [insert action here] button. Matt Simplicity of use does not equate to simplicity of programing. The simplest action for a user is to use one app to take care of multiple types of messaging. Taking SMS away from Hangouts will not encourage people to use Hangouts, nor can I think of a circumstance where someone wouldn't use an app because it handled SMS, particularly when you can turn that option on and off. boop There's no evidence to back up Hangouts' labyrinth of communication tools as beneficial to the casual user and plenty to the contrary as low feature usage and reports of confusion were the cause of Hangouts being gutted and replaced by multiple single-purpose products. Matt First of all, there's a large gap between labyrinth of communication tools and containing SMS. Second, no evidence seems a little harsh. It's not overly strong evidence (but let's face it, no one runs double blind studies on stuff like this), but Allo does 1 thing and isn't matching Hangouts user numbers. And no, I don't say that "as though implementing multiple communication tools into a single app and having it presented to the user in a way that's by any means coherent isn't a monumental challenge." Acknowledging that challenge is implicit in my statement by saying that two are not the same. Making something simple to use can often be challenging, and making something that requires little effort to make will frequently lead to something that isn't simple to use. What you're failing to take into account is the simplicity that is inherent in using the same app for multiple, similar things, and the complexity that is using multiple apps to do the same thing in slightly different ways. boop Allo is a long-term project. It's meant to be a blank slate that evolves to suit the needs of its target audience rather than throwing everything in and hoping users can work it out. Also, Allo is coming post no one trusting Google messaging services. Regarding complexity, doing one thing well is indeed a considerable effort. Doing many things well components is not of a comparable level of effort that the decision to go that route can be made lightly and the individual components would be compromised one way or another. It also dilutes usage data for improving the each component. As for SMS in Hangouts specifically, there's just no reason for it to be there. Android Messages is Google's flagship app for SMS/RCS and since Hangouts for consumers is no longer in active development and thusly won't get RCS support it's best to just scrap the feature. Sachin Bahal Me: Hey Google, where's that SMS fallback for Allo? Google: soon™ Duder12 RCS fallback may avoid apples patents on SMS fallback. It's going to be glorious boop Actually, I believe they said they currently have no intent to put SMS in Allo. midas617 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4b1cf2f962fbf2426bc0ca42b5c2b6807811ead0eeb83065e29687abb85a0930.jpg JasonIvers Ugh... I use Hangouts for nearly all of my communication. This is going to be such a pain... I felt like I finally had all my stuff in one place... GV, carrier number, voice mail, instant messaging, pretty much everything but email, and I seldom use that any more. parkerjh Is there any solution now to get GV SMS and mobile SMS into one app? Ugh. Dee Mann No selw0nk You still can use Google Voice. James Donut Google wants us to download Messenger app for any SMS. Nuff said Sachin Bahal I thinking you mean Android Messages (the app formerly known as Google Messenger) chri5 So It's about what customers want h4rr4r This consumer wants a desktop client as well. If I am sitting in front of a monitor I should not have ro grab my phone to reply to people. Wes C Unless you're on fi. Sachin Bahal Just wait until Google announces another messaging app hp-fourtwenty Really, who didn't see this coming over a year ago??? John Camey Seriously, Google.... I've been with you thru thick and thin. From Nexus 1 to Pixel. From flashing, to compiling, to plain old stock Android. I'm not switching SMS apps, again. Hangouts already handles carrier SMS, g-voice, and as many Gmail/Hangouts accounts as I feel like linking. What f*cking problem are you trying to solve for me, now?? Honestly.... You seem to go out of your way to create problems where they don't already exist, without ever truly solving the glaring issues that could be easily resolved. Google.... You can pretty much go pound sand. Pixel might be my last Android device. I'm over it. selw0nk "The message states that Google Voice users will not be affected" John Camey Great. Gvoice will still work (for now). Currently, everything works. Why fix something that isn't broken? Matt They also said Hangouts for consumers wasn't going anywhere. Which is one of those technically true, but highly misleading. Monday: "Don't worry, your house isn't going anywhere." Tuesday: "We're taking everything that isn't the frame and foundation of your house and throwing it away." Troy Leonard I'm with you, iPhone 8 here I come. Thanks Google, now I feel dirty. There was a reason Trillian was popular on pc back in the early 2000's.it was one a client for all your I'm protocols. That's what I want for messaging on my phone, all my messages in place. DN I never, ever, thought I would say this, but I'm with you. I left Apple when they started the, 'let's sue everyone instead of innovate ourselves' movement. But, at least they have great hardware and a good plan for simple operation for users. I may actually consider trying the iPnone 8 if I can get over my ideological misgivings. Trooper311 Hey Google! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9d886ce93111d2961a08cb1d13b874d83e4e94c6dd94800325f54b6d3bdf4b6f.gif marcusmarcus2 Hey back, We know you like Lucille, so we decided to take that from you as well. Sincerely, Google. http://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/supernatural-walking-dead.jpg Trooper311 Lol nice! AD1980 Well I'll stop using Hangouts finally. Not sure what service I will use, but I certainly will not use any Google product. History has taught me to expect Google apps to get a few years support and then be abandoned in favor of 'the next best thing '. I'm done playing. Giampi Personally after so many years I only used GTalk -> Hangouts (an not other services) I moved to Telegram. I use Messages for the very few SMS (mainly activation codes and bank payment confirmations) Dominic81 Oh Google.... Vedang Jadhav The direction is looking clear from here. Hangouts is going to be only focused for business and Allo will be going a full consumer chatting application. I feel by the end of this year, Allo will have a desktop app, will support SMS and will be what people expect Hangouts to be. If that happens, it can be a good move over the period of time, rather calling a hangouts for business different version and Only hangouts for consumers, which can be confusing. If that is the path, which i expect Google is taking, then it looks good to me. Or if they are actually confused, man, my so many words are just waste!! Impulse_Vigil Well the desktop client was already announced to be in the works... Hopefully it doesn't take all freaking year. SMS might be another story, AFAIK they've indicated it's not in the cards for the immediate future... Maybe they were coy and/or waiting for RCS, who knows tho, in the meantime it's a mess. lorenzobjuarez Um, yea except... this should have been done from Allo's DAY ONE!!! NOT A FREAKING YEAR LATER!!! tim242 It does not. chri5 Will it /automatically/ fallback to SMS if recipient doesn't have Allo like iMessage tim242 No. TypoCorrecto http://i.imgur.com/KdG7I7I.gif raitchison I already switched from Messenger to Hangouts, if I switch to Allo now they will just discontinue that in a couple years and try to force me onto something else for no good reason. I think I'll just minimize my pain and try one of the more popular 3rd party SMS apps. chri5 Pulse, by Klinker Apps (Talon Twitter client) is great SMS Josh Brown Signal is getting very good. sproc Problem is, you don't choose want you want, but what everyone else uses. And that's one of three: 1. ichat thanks to apple 2. whatsapp thanks to whatever and of course screwed over by facebook 3. SMS. No one aside from my tech nerds uses hangouts. Never has and never will. And one person probably tried allo and then never uses it (which also is a lot of ppl on whatsapp) Too bad apple users don't even know which one is working - which is the genius of it. Zorn85 The thing is, though, iMessage doesn't preclude you from messaging those people. Apple's Messages app has some actual sanity, and if you send a message to someone from an Android, it simply delivers it to them in the same exact way, just in green text and SMS form. When you are talking about Allo/Whatsapp, unless you live in China where everyone uses that, most people in the U.S. are exclusively reachable via text by their phone number. mxwp tech nerds and business use hangouts... but "normals" use hangouts chat too except they just think "is that the chat thing that opens when i log onto gmail?" for them. James Maccioli Ahh... Google Messaging apps and RCS. 2017's version of the Pixel's bezels. Let the boards go crazy! Ailín Ó’S What a mess. I'm glad WhatsApp is king in Europe, practically no one even bothered trying Hangouts anyway. Duder12 Which proves Googles entire point of moving it to business only... It never took off with consumers. Move on people. Ailín Ó’S Right, but Google being Google; I'm sure they'll mess that up too. jak_341 To think Google could have bought WhatsApp... Rod In Latin America too. Nick Cannon Been using Hangouts since it came out. Last app I used was Go SMS. Don't even know what's good anymore. Josh Brown Signal AdamFitton Signal. Wife and I made the switch to Signal a month ago. Better than the stock messaging app. Midnitte Hey, remember that time they told us in r/ProjectFi that SMS in Hangouts wasnt going anywhere? I guess they were half right. "No changes were announced for SMS integration with Project Fi, which allows texts and calls to go through Hangouts, but I'm almost certain that it will stay (at least as long as Voice integration does)." I'm not so certain. Hopefully they'll move it to using Messages thanks to RCS, I can only hope that happens soon because I'm sick of Hangouts and the path Google has chosen for it. boop Things are happening exactly as implied for the past year or so. Carrier SMS is going, Voice/Fi isn't. Midnitte You're insane if you think they won't eventually remove that too. Impulse_Vigil Well, at least they're leaving no doubt about what lane they're putting Hangouts in, so people can stop pining for the old Hangout... It's no longer on life support, it's dead, stick a fork in it. Now get to improving Allo darnit, I'm not 100% in the camp that thinks it needs SMS fallback but it definitely needs a desktop client if it's ever not gonna be one more niche chat app. The RCS/SMS saga is bigger than any one app's development tho, I feel like they're probably trying to see how it pans out before committing to fallback on Allo... Or it might just be easier to test on Messages. tim242 Hangouts is not dead... Impulse_Vigil It's dead in the consumer space... They wanna position it as a business tool. Except for Voice/Fi users that don't have a choice? Which is more than a little weird. b_freeman It's like Google is trying to get me to give up and just use Facebook Messenger. Impulse_Vigil Do people actually commit to one chat app? It's never seemed like I could consciously get people to make that choice... Family has always been SMS heavy, could never get them on Hangout yet a bunch jumped on Allo out of the blue, some jumped on other less popular IM... Meanwhile old high school & college friends have mostly relied on FB as people start changing #s etc over time... At the same time online buddies will use something else entirely. Yeah I can be a dick and say "not using that sorry", multiple apps never bothered me that much. Android is definitely weaker for not having some clear choices from the start tho, BBM and iMessages were both big selling points for their respective platforms. b_freeman I do...mostly. I'll use Facebook Messenger but have never had a desire to link my phone number to my account so I haven't tried SMS through it yet. As far as everything else goes everyone​ I know has text messaging through whatever carrier they use so SMS fallback has always seemed a must. I don't want to have to think about which app I need to use to talk to someone. tim242 The new GV app is terrible. It allows me to pick from my Google contacts, but doesn't shpw the name or picture in the threads. Still no VOIP. They added the ability tp delete a conversation, but not by long pressing. They are so ridiculous. Picaso86 VOIP is my biggest pet-peeve with the "new" Google Voice app. I need to be able to call over my data since I'm using my GV as my main number. Radio East PDX But see, if you just install "Hangouts Dialer," you can use VOIP!* * void where prohibited tim242 I know, but I am talking about the all new GV app. Orlando aka Pixel XL GAYYYYYY Kevin Davis I've never gotten the big deal with all this bullshit. Whatever carrier you were own, there is no problem sending SMS, MMS, or making all the voice calls that you want. What is the big deal with all these disparate messaging apps? rockstarr27 We should have a poll of what popular product google will abandon next year. Impulse_Vigil What are the front runners? G+? Tasks? (doesn't ever seem to get any love, much less an app, it's like the calendar's redheaded stepchild) Earth the app? Radio East PDX G+ isn't popular. What's left of it has long needed a trip behind the woodshed. brian. What is going on? DragoCubed Why does Google do this? *Sigh* TheDrunkenClam Hangouts used to also have a widget that was phenomenal. For some reason, Google is hell-bent on killing off their best messaging app yet. Just absolute stupidity. It is also the one app they had with the best name recognition. Just when Hangouts was starting to catch on, they decide to cripple and kill it. humulos Oh FFS BC Eh, I usually send SMS using the default messaging app on my phone and use Allo/FB Messenger for everything else. Though it's good to know what Google's plans are for Hangouts, I just find myself not caring as Hangouts has been dead to me for a while. Sir_Brizz They really need to state their plans for Fi. They are really leaving us hanging with this and it's pretty stupid and annoying. Grey How do people use Messaging apps? Here is how I use mine - get notification, open notification, reply, home button. Do you people live in your Messaging app? I don't see the benefit to having a single spot for your communications. And I don't understand what makes SMS so special - people talking about moving all your communication to Facebook - so you already have to use Facebook for some communication, why does SMS need to be in Hangouts? Every separate messaging system should be its own app. b_freeman I only use Facebook once in a blue moon, for people I don't have a phone number on. I could probably count on one hand how often I've used it in the last year. I use SMS everyday. I like things simple. I don't want to have to think about which app I need to use when I want to text someone, I also don't want a bunch of hardly used apps on my phone. Grey If you use SMS everyday then you're likely happy to have a SMS app. b_freeman I want an SMS app with iMessage capabilities like sync across all devices without a Bluetooth connection to my phone like some desktop apps. Eric Jones You don't ever send new messages, only replies? I have no idea what anyone uses, so being able to have SMS and hangouts in one app is much more convenient. I also like to have my SMS messages available on my phone, and through the browser. It's much more convenient. It wouldn't matter as much if Allo or Messages actually had a web interface. Grey But it sends either SMS or Hangouts and you don't know which they are using so how is that helpful? Eric Jones Because it's saved in my phone with their name on it.... I don't have to pay attention once it's been entered. JG I like having SMS in Hangouts for the simplicity. All of my messages are in one place. I don't need to open various apps to keep conversations going. It also helps to keep the phone a little tidier.. One less app in the ever growing app drawer or on the home screen. And granted, its only a few megabytes, but one app rather than two means I save a little storage. And for those less versed in technology (like my mother) it means you only have to learn one app. No need to stress over remembering if the person uses Hangouts or SMS - just find the conversation thread already started... Rod I guess most people message a lot nowadays. Friend groups, etc. James Maccioli Hate to say it.. Samsung still owns the carriers based off Android sales. So RCS will take off when Samsung is ready to roll out their RCS cloud platform and carriers will comply. It's supposed to be compliant to UP RCS so hope that means Pixel/Nexus users will benefit too.. DoctorRabbitfoot From what I understand of RCS, it shouldn't matter if carriers go Samsung or Google's RCS. They both support the same "universal profile". Yes, Samsung has huge market share, but from my understanding, that part of RCS should be seamless and ultimately invisible to the end user. Just need commitments from Verizon who has been silent on the matter. And of course, Apple will probably never comply (or at least not for 2 years...when they invent the iMessage for everyone lol) James Maccioli I'm guessing TMo goes with Samsung's platform being they were the only US carrier listed on Samsung's release statement. AT&T and Verizon will probably sit back and see who will fork out the most money. A lot of data to be had by these cloud platforms cabbieBot I am posting in these here comments so that when the due diligence of digital archeology is performed someone with real eyes will realize real lies. I am here. This is a time capsule. In the year 2017, Google finally let the shoe drop and closed the loop on the original lie: "Voice is the future of Hangouts". #meta Eric Jones As soon as I read this, I immediately contacted Project Fi support. They said: "That change will not affect Project Fi users." I suspect that this only applies to G-Suite customers, and not to the general hangouts app. Edited to add quotation marks. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman The "improvements" to the Voice app are mostly skin deep. I switched back for a week and went screaming back to Hangouts. Missing so many basic functions. Radio East PDX I've been a Voice user for years and the new Voice app is half-baked as fuck. If you use the web app and need to change a setting, there's literally a "switch to legacy Google Voice" because they didn't put 90% of the settings, and half of everything else, in the new app. It looks nicer, that's about it. Maybe Google could, I don't know, try finishing products before shipping them? Carson Saldanha Just a sign guys that Google's gonna have some more messaging announcements at Google I/O Gabriel Macys Yeah, TWO MORE messaging apps. Rob H. Yea good move when they can't even include SMS support in Allo. This just gives me a reason no not want to support Android going forward. I do not want to use multiple apps for messaging. Edward Palomares Jr Way too many too choose from and not even including who your manufacture is Google needs to get ahold of this,I've never seen anything like this before.Google needs 1 sms including wifi only just like iMessages..The manufacturer company's need to rejoice and make 1 sms or Google needs to just have 1 ship with phones..Such a hassle I want to use Allo but people won't change from Samsung sms Max Johnson Hate to say this, but this seems a lot like what Apple would do, I wonder if that's what Google is going for now. Nathan J Why should Google cover texting when so many apps do it better? Google should just buy Textra. IIRC that was the best one when I last used an Android phone. That and one other. You have no shortage of choices. No one really needs IM anymore. iMessage was such a big deal when texting plans were a thing. Now that all the major carriers just have unlimited SMS/MMS, why bother? Rich content? Okay, that's fair, but it's not essential. Texting is for text, and anything else, I just use Facebook Messenger or Telegram, but I could live without both. TechNoBull Oh man....I hope Textra does not sell out to Goople.....then the app would change and die. Textra saved me from all this Goople messenger BS. JD You make it sound like Google would make Textra Better. Look at the history of Google, they don't make the things they buy better. They Gut them, leave them a useless husk of what they used to be, dying in the gutter and then implement what was once great; really half assed in to 6 different really really bad Google Products. Then they shut those products down when it seems like the silverlining is coming and roll out 6 more half assed products to replace 1 half ass product. They use an exponential half-assing algorithm for product development. Cam Lawrence This was the right step. Hangouts has been a mess for a while. Even when it was fully functional and got the material update it was super buggy and slow and video never worked right for me. At one point I stopped getting notifications completely and couldn't ever fix it. Allo and Duo both have promise. I wish they'd give Allo SMS, but if they continue to add features (web, integration w/duo, backup, etc) then it will be a legit option. They're on the right trajectory and they just have to be patient and put time, effort and features into both apps, while streamlining everything better. tim242 Google employee spotted. ccccc https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/edcb9f4bafa1958d1cdf972c9ad669bdf661e6cb6c16c08c9723253770b6e6b4.png this should be included with any announcement of google products Jayson Stephenson They are removing a standard, not adding one. I fail to see how this applies to this article. JG For a brief moment, I had an admittedly very unlikely (near 0.00% possible) thought... Maybe they're shutting down Hangouts SMS so they can transition it to Allo SMS... But... Google wouldn't have any involvement with sending SMSs (except for Project Fi customers) so its not cause they'll be re-purposing the servers from one chat app to the other... I know htey see it as a step backwards for some reason, but I would still like to see Google add SMS to Allo, at least as a fall back. When I send a new message, have the app quickly check the registered users list. If I'm sending the message to another Allo user, it sends via Allo. If that person isn't an Allo user (or there isn't a data connection) send it via carrier SMS. That way, the message is automatically sent via the method with the most encryption. SMS is clear text, while Allo messages are at least in transit encrypted. boop The problem is that iMessage works because of how iOS works. The SMS fallback solves 100% of edge cases for both parties regardless of their device--you literally cannot send an iMessage to a device that isn't configured to have everything work perfectly. SMS fallback in Allo solves few edge cases, does nothing for most and may even cause issues. There are a lot more variables and configuration falls in the user's lap--not only is there no guarantee that everything would work out neatly, it's likely that it wouldn't. It would add unnecessary complication to the development process to ultimately accomplish nothing. James Woods WhatsApp! This SMS integration thing, is strictly an American thing, and a very lame one. If you are on Android, WhatsApp should be the first app you download like everyone else in the world. SMS, is only for talking to iPhone ppl. Gabriel Macys this is why imessenger beats the shit out of Google, who has six different apps to do the job of one. If their main competitor can make one app for all messaging forms, what is preventing one of the largest programming companies in the world from doing it Rod Last I saw, Facetime was a separate app from iMessage. JD Well yes but the integration to jump to it is 2 presses away and the video calling works much better than Hangouts. I just wish They would fix hangouts. Rod Hangouts is gonna be phased put. The new contender is Duo. JD Sadly I know. I just hoped they would have fixed Hangouts. I had hopes the video calling would have been as good as Facetime. Even Duo isn't as good as facetime, in quality and reliability. Dn Bro Last I heard it was because of some patent that apple had that prevented them from adding SMS directly into Google Allo Rod WhatsApp is terrible. Wish Telegram was the standard. Bala for gods sake just merge android messaging, messenger, hangouts ,allo, duo into one single app and bring it in the name of gtalk !!!! Alvar Lagerlof SMS support in apps is just stupid! Thanks! marcusmarcus2 I'm not impressed http://i2.cdn.turner.com/dr/hln/www/release/sites/default/files/imagecache/breaking_news_896/2012/08/10/mckayladisappointed.jpg Jay LOL sms. Rod As a non-USA resident, it's actually funny to see so many people bothering with SMS and whatnot. Lol I don't even remember the last time I sent/received a SMS. (and they're free on all carriers by now) Francesdvargas Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Wandile Tembe I really do not understand. Hangout had everything going. Why slowly shut it down. I loved the idea of using one app for voice, sms, video call and IM. DarrenSaw I'm as big a fan of Google as anyone, but their whole messaging strategy is a nonsensical mess. Michael D. Android is the most used smartphone platform. Most people using android have a google account. All of these people could automatically be using hangouts and never bother with anything else. And yet Google managed to create such a mess and make people use stupid alternatives. Excellent work Google, thanks. Matthias VW Any alternative worth looking at? Radio East PDX Signal. givitumibeybi Come on guys don't be so mean... They are most probably just trying to reduce the app size so they can have more space for "2 new sick fathers day emojis". blindexecutioner Does the voice app send messages over wifi or does it require cellular data? It's not really an option if it requires cellular. Radio East PDX It uses wifi when you're on wifi. joe huard Doesnt google voice have video chat or will they like hangouts was? 4Ui812 Don't worry folks it'll be back in a future update. It's the Google way. TechGuy22 Because why not. They gotta force you to use allo rohiggidy Google is doing this to push carrier RCS. Its a deal they made. The same deal which allowed Android Pay to be a system app and default on all Android devices. Android Messages is the solution to Androids problem not hangouts or Allo. This is an Android problem. Imessage for IOS and RCS for Android its that simple. The carriers forced google to create the google messenger app in 2014. We all know this. So why is this shocking. Allo doesnt matter. RCS aka Android messages matters [email protected] Well, I go with Signal then once and forever. Signal does everything Hangouts did before and does - and all real encrypted. So: No real loss. shaku Hangouts dead? Now I'm not sure which app is default app for SMS for my nexus Google Allo? Google messages? JD Signal? F4LL0U7 This is ridiculous. A disappointing and unnecessary change. I loved being able to do all my messaging through one app (Hangouts, G Voice texts, G Voice voicemail, carrier SMS/MMS). That was the biggest strength of Hangouts over any other app in any other ecosystem. Now for the couple of messages per month I receive via my carrier number, I have to have an entire other app installed. Moronic. Next they'll probably remove Google Voice integration. V2THE1 I'm irritated with Google over all of these messaging apps. James Bray https://68.media.tumblr.com/f8d306007614d5c2bdddd86fdfbc94e0/tumblr_nna5xeJO681t9sksvo1_400.gif Manikandan Guru Fuck you Google create812 Google Fi integration with Hangouts, and being able to send SMS/MMS from desktop is simply amazing. I haven't had but one issue with it, and use both desktop app, and phone app all day long. If they end up pulling this integration without an equivalent and/or better service to replace it, it may just be the single worst thing Google's ever done to me. Nick Man, I hope Project Fi users are unaffected. Receiving and sending texts from my desktop client of Hangouts has been a staple feature for me ever since Project Fi first started. reggjoo Hangouts, if not f** with and was just updated, with the new features that google's various other "new" Apps have, basically would be better in the long run instead of this mess that google's making. Stick with something that works, and that people, from the advanced, to the novice can use and understand. I'd rather have a all-in-one app, instead of a separate mish-mash of separate apps##, that are bloated, stay in memory, waste battery, and take space in the desktop, or app drawer. Google's a great company, but geez! Keep it simple for this! Tiuri Elvander Recently I just don't understand Google anymore. JD It's ok I'll be Removing Google Support in all of my messaging needs on May 22. headpiece747 I have always used Hangouts and nothing else because it did everything I needed SMS, Gmail integration and MMS. The thing I will miss most is getting my SMS on my desktop in Gmail an responding from there. I know there are probably apps and programs that can do all this. Now will have to research this and then show my wife and mom how to use them since I got them all on Hangouts. Rob But sms never showed up in web version or synced across devices ePoch 270 Mine did. For a long time I had an office with no cell coverage and did all my sms communication with web/chrome app. osgoodschlotter After 7 years of being a diehard Nexus user, I bought my first iPhone on Monday. Not thrilled about it, but I'm less thrilled about the GVoice, Hangouts, Allo, Duo, Messenger, Chat, Meet, fiasco. Ugh, and now this news. I almost feel like my switch is justified/vindicated. Google... what happened to you? Hangouts was THE BEST messenger, and you got convinced by iMessenger-internet-critics that it wasn't. Shame on you. Joe I did the same a few months ago. I just dont trust google to create a single messaging client that will touch imessage for a long time. I still do use mostly google apps on my iphone however. osgoodschlotter Same here... my iPhone is all Google Apps. From Chrome, to Gmail, to Google Photos, to Google Maps, to Google Analytics, to Google Keep, and everything in between. Although, I must admit --- this iMessage app is pretty damn nice. :| Zachary Dunn This is effing ridiculous and infuriating. They made an app that could handle all of my conversations, but now are stripping it for parts. Does this affect use of Hangouts web client for SMS? I'm a Fi user and can't access Google Voice. voice.google.com and google.com/voice both redirect me to project fi site which doesn't handle SMS kalehv For Fi, you can still continue using Hangouts. Fi/GV SMS in Hangouts are transported over data connection unlike other carriers. I wish I could use GV app too - Another Fi user. Chris Sanner dammit google....be glad I'm as invested in your ecosystem as I am because all this jerking me around with how I do things is getting really old. I'm already wary whenever you introduce a new product - the chances of you pulling the plug is just too high for me to be willing to invest much effort in it. oh hey, maybe that's why part of why Allo is seeing such slow adoption. that and the huge missing features. Lee For Pete's sakes just use Open Whisper System's Signal App for your SMS communications already. Just kidding use whatever you like. Personally I tried using SMS on Hangouts and it just didn't suffice for me but I could totally see the advantages of having everything in one app (ie. Google Voice messages, SMS messages, and Hangout messages). Plus the less number of apps you run on your mobile device the greater free space on your device. [A]dri[A]n Umm, WHAT? Haha Like, why? Jesus Christ Google... SyCoREAPER UPDATE for Project Fi Users only SyCoREAPER 11:30 AM I was hoping you could relay a message to another team as this directly affects my Project Fi experience. Alex11:30 AM What do you mean? SyCoREAPER 11:31 AM Hangouts ability to use SMS was crucial for my Project Fi existence and happiness. Some brain dead iphone user at Google has signed off on removing Hangouts ability to send and receive SMS SyCoREAPER 11:32 AM Hangouts was the only app that I was reliably receiving messages with on Fi Alex11:32 AM Project Fi users can still send SMS messages through Hangouts and will not be affected by these changes. selonmoi Great! I'm really looking forward to having to use two different apps for SMS messages through my Voice and carrier numbers. It makes so much sense to have Voice SMS in the same app as Hangouts messages and carrier SMS in a different app. Keep up the great work, Google. Volodesi "No changes were announced for SMS integration with Project Fi, which allows texts and calls to go through Hangouts, but I'm almost certain that it will stay (at least as long as Voice integration does)." It better! I pretty much only do my SMS messaging through Hangouts on PC via Project Fi. DirkBelig Whew! That update was exactly what I was coming here to freak out about as a Project Fi user who has both Hangouts and SMS-only contacts and used his PC and Nexus 6P to communicate with them. tyb82 UNBELIEVABLE Thomas It's time to wait and see what apple will make this year. Google is getting more and more retarded. Insight Spinner Once upon a time Google tested a tool that revolutionized work and personal communications... Then they killed it. Oh wait... We're not taking about Wave? Craig Kendall Tonight, my Nexus 5x running on 7.1 (I'm in the beta program) on Google Fi prompted me to select an app other than Hangouts to send/receive SMS. I was so disappointed. Back to the Android Messages app for SMS and Hangouts for... well, hangouts. So sad. Oh, and I got prompted to do an OTA update to the latest 7.1.2 relase... just under 26mb download and installation completed fairly quickly. Good bye unified message app :( Travis Halfman How do you get that warning to go away? I use my GV number for texting, so I shouldn't be affected, yet I can't seem to remove this warning!

Google Assistant's new shopping list is live, here's how it works Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/10 7:00pm PDTApr 10, 2017 60 Plus 1 on G+ 110 Share on Facebook 80 Share on Twitter Total Shares250 Applications Google News When Google Assistant was first introduced, you could ask it to add items to your personal shopping list. This would create a note called 'Google Assistant shopping list' in Google Keep, and you could easily manage your list from the Keep app (or web app). It makes sense that your shopping list would be in the same app as your notes, right? Apparently not to Google, because two days ago, a support article was updated to say the shopping list is moving out of Keep. Why? Because the new list ties into Google Express, so you can order what you need in fewer steps. That doesn't make the change any less stupid, but that's the reason.    When you ask Assistant to add something to your list, it is now added to the Google Express shopping list. You can actually have multiple shopping lists, and set any of them as the default. You can also share lists with other Google accounts, and they can easily add or remove items (which was a bit buggy with Keep lists). You might notice that some items (like the Vitamin Water in the above screenshot) have a tiny umbrella icon. When you tap it, it will link you to the product on Google Express. I guess that's useful? But there are some major problems with this implementation too. Unless you have the Google Express app installed, your shopping list is opened in a Chrome Custom Tab. Google could have easily added this to the Google app, but they didn't. One of my favorite aspects of the Keep list was being able to check items off with my watch (through the Android Wear Keep app). Even if you have the Express app installed, there's no way to access the list from Android Wear. In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep. So in summary, the new shopping list implementation is two steps forward, one step back. Feel free to vent your frustration in the comments below.

Stupid move. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's my main problem with this. I used the shopping list for non-online purchases, while this clearly oriented for online shopping. Todd Johnson Agreed... So I can go grocery shopping and tick stuff off! Marilyndivey Google is paying $97 per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !ft223c: On monday I got a great new mclaren f1 from having earned $12778 this last four weeks.. 3 to 5 hours of work a day... Weekly paychecks... Bonus opportunities...Its the most-financialy rewarding I've had.. It sounds unbelievable but you wont forgive yourself if you don’t check it !ft223c: ➽➽ ➽➽➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs663TopSociety/GetPaid$97/Hour... ★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫★✫★★✫:::!ft223c:....,..... Chris Sanner It's okay. I'm plenty ticked off. Tenley H Yes I mainly use it for grocery shopping. Now in Express, you can't drag & drop to rearrange list items. And there's no "delete all checked items", so once I'm done shopping I need to go in and individually delete each item. Big step back not forward... Teja Common, Its just an option. You can ignore it completely but removing keep integration is something we need to worry about. akshay7394 That's his point, though. Removing keep integration made it much harder to use for anybody that uses this primarily for grocery (read: *offline*) shopping javier rodriguez I vow here and now to Never purchase an item from Google Express... Unless they add YouTube red to the stupid yearly charge. whispy_snippet Never even heard of Google Express because it's not actually available in Australia. So now my Google Assistant shopping list in Keep has been gimped because... no reason at all. Todd Johnson That's what I thought when I was reading this article... What the F@&% is Google Express, look it up and yeah good work Google, change a feature that people use to something that people don't use... They are releasing the Google Home in the UK and it doesn't look like Google Express is available there? So what, UK users won't be able to use the feature? I bought a Google Home about 1.5weeks ago and am waiting for it to arrive. Yay! Upon reading the below comments, I suppose we could name a list as Coles list or Woolies List... But that is such a stupid work around! EDIT: And it's a monthly subscription!!!! "Google Express membership is $10/month or $95/year after your trial." - https://www.google.com/express/u/0/about Alex To be honest, the only difference for those of us without Express is that it opens up the shopping list in Chrome instead of Keep. That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. It's a weird move to tie it to this app/service that isn't even available in the region that they just launched Home in, though. I don't really follow why, if they were going to do anything, they didn't just make it a part of the Google Home app itself. All they've done is remove one bodge of tying it to another app/service and changed it to another bodge of tying it to another app/service - except this app can't even be downloaded here... akshay7394 > That's a bit disadvantageous, but I'm also the only person I know that even knows Keep exists, let alone uses it, so nothing will significantly change. I strongly disagree. What about offline-syncing? This current implementation always opens a chrome custom tab. I, for example, would always use it such that I'd note what I needed and then, later, refer to Keep (which has it sync'd offline) to see and check-off what I need and bought. Alvar Lagerlof It is possible till make offline websites. But they haven't Alex I'd assume the app previously opened Keep up in a browser too if you didn't have it installed (which would seem to be more common than not, from my anecdotal experience) - so for a lot of people it won't be any different. It's surprising that they wouldn't use Chrome's offline ability though. Has anyone actually tested it to find out? xxTheGoDxx Google Keep has 100 to 500 million users... tabguy2 Since that's the "only difference" what you're saying is that I'll still be able to see the list on my Android Wear watch? demarcmj FWIW, the price is competitive with Amazon Prime. That doesn't solve the availability issue of course. Cory S Prime offers a whole lot more than shipping. Express doesn't even scratch the surface of product availability, or benefits. If they tossed in Red, and Play Music, it be somewhat comparable...but even then. demarcmj Some people may find the overnight or sometimes same day delivery outweighs or at least balances the difference in number of products. Plus, you can get groceries from this, which Amazon charges extra for and doesn't even have competitive prices on. I'd say for the shipping aspect at least, the services both have pros and cons and which one is "better" would depend on the needs of the person. I'll give you the fact that Prime has a bunch of other services bundled in with it, but I suspect that a large percentage of people don't even use those. Cory S Express doesn't offer any perishable good on the grocery front...So it's of limited use there. Amazon doesn't charge extra for prime now which includes far more in the grocery selection area. It just has a minimum purchase price of 20 dollars. However, it does have a tip suggestion (which is optional) which I find annoying. PAY YOUR DRIVERS AMAZON. demarcmj All true... although Prime Now is only available in a small number of major cities. My point in comparing it to prime was simply directed at Todd Johnson's incredulity that "it's a monthly subscription!!!!" (four exclamation points). Of course it's a monthly subscription! bekifft Do yourself a favor and return it / cancel the order while you can. Jon Edge I would demand my money back. Oh wait... whispy_snippet Ha, well played. xxTheGoDxx Nor in Germany, nor anywhere else outside the US. OK Google, WTF? h4rr4r You know how hard it is to make services work upside down? It takes time. MatchstickMan Great, now my shopping list isn't easily accessible by the Keep widget on one of my home screens and I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up! Thanks, Google! rh I just tell Google to remind me next ti e I'm at a Walmart to get bread coffee razors and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk, then when I pull into said parking lot I get a text reminder of what I need,..boom done and done Hayden Pearce > "and if I think of other stuff I tell Google again to remind me to get shaving cream ,surgery and milk" "OK, Google. Remind me to get surgery." rh :) MatchstickMan That's a nice workaround, but obviously not ideal... Cory S Meh, those location based reminders seem to work 1 out of 5 times for me, and in this case it isn't that useful if it did work. If I am at the store I don't need to be reminded I have a list...I need a good list app that ideally is shareable and syncs with the person shopping with me. Teja "Okay Google, show me my shopping list" should work though. Anyways I also prefer Keep integration as the list can be a shared list. MatchstickMan Ah shit, using voice assistant? That's actually a pretty good point, I'll keep that in mind. Teja Damn! you're good at sarcasm. I just gave you an alternative for "I now have to open Home, click the sidebar menu, then select shopping list and wait for the Chrome tab to load up!" I do agree that a Google Keep widget is a simpler way to access the list rather than a voice command. Especially when you have people around, as it would be awkward to talk to your phone. :P MatchstickMan Haha! I really didn't mean for it to come off as maliciously sarcastic as I'm now reading it. I sincerely never considered it! Teja Haha. Its sounded like that to me. Anyways thanks for the clarification :P nside1 The Google app (Google search box widget) still allows me to add items to my Google keep shopping list, will that change? Corbin Davenport No idea. Nicolas Finn From the article: "In addition, adding items to the shopping list through Google Now still adds them to Keep." David Hyman Hopefully this evolves quickly into something great. Adding a widget and launcher shortcuts should make getting there very easy. And if this allows me to better manage the items on my list I'm all in. I really want to be able to ask is peanut butter on my list and have assistant say "yes" instead of just reading me my entire list Grey So "hope all the lost functionality is restored"? David Hyman Yep, pretty much all of us can hope for at this point dylan-m Of course, not living in the United States, I don't have the Google Express app. (Not that most people do anyway). So I get the dumb website instead. First thing I notice is you can add other lists. Interesting. And yet if I say "add foo to my to do list" it adds to a new list in Google Keep anyway. So apparently this feature only applies to lists with names like "shopping list." Brilliant, Google. Top notch interface design, as ever. Lateef Alabi-Oki I heard Google services killed the first born children of the Google Assistant team. That's why they don't like integrating with Google services. It's personal for them. Booyabobby I rather the list stay on Keep. supersanborn The original clunky approach of being unable to use an existing keep shopping lift has been made clunkier. Guess I'll keep not using this feature. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I used Keep because it was really useful for grocery shopping in the usual supermarket. Grey Nope you have to buy from Google Express. Also, not telling you what Google Express is. newtonfb God dammit. I'm going to get slammed with messages tomorrow from friends and family asking what's going on and why did they change it....And I have no answer for them. I really do hate Google when they do shit like this. Already give us the option to keep using Keep. bozzykid I guess Google is really desperate to push Google Express that they don't care how terrible it makes Google Assistant. Great job Google! Nick I never understood why it was in keep in the first place so this makes more sense. pfmiller Because Keep is meant for keeping notes and lists. Seems pretty obvious to me. Who on Earth would think to go to the Google Home app for their shopping list? Paul_Werner Meh, I'll stick to Flipp for my shopping list/coupons/grocery store maps Hypnotoad I don't think I've been this pissed with Google since Allo... What the hell!? I don't want to use Google Express, I never signed up for it and I don't have the app, please put my shopping list back in Google keep!!! I can add to my keep shopping list via Google now, but not the assistant, what the hell is wrong with this!? Sir_Brizz Two steps sideways, two steps back. Seth Merritt Should be one step forward, two steps back. Hexlattice It's like it's not even forward at all... One step to the side, one fall down a cliff. m-p{3} If I can't use Google Keep to manage that list on a desktop and more importantly make it shared with a relative living in the same HOME, then Google fucked up. ngwoo I love it when something called an "assistant" stops providing assistance. This is probably the stupidest change Google ever made - at least let us choose which list to use. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Being an Android Site you guys should be used to Google going 2 steps forward and 1 step back. It's called Job Security. Marty McWong Just as an aside, are many Nexus 5X/6P owners are still waiting for Assistant to roll out? I've yet to receive it, and if it makes a difference I'm on 7.1.2 (via the beta), no root and with an apparently up to date (7.6.08...) Play Store... Grey Check your settings Marty McWong Oh, re-reading the original AP article (http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/03/02/google-assistant-coming-android-6-0-devices/) I see they mention checking language settings... Mine is set to English UK, so that's probably it (I'll check after work), thanks! Grey "Can't we just add Google Express support to Keep?" "You're fired." create812 Get your logic out of here! Kevin Sword relevant CoffeeZombie I like Keep. I have a shared shopping list on Keep with my wife. We can both add things to it and take things off that we've bought. We both have access to it at the store. I could use it from my watch while at the store, which was always nice. Google Now knew how to add items to this shared list, too. It was super convenient. "Oh, we're out of milk! Okay, Google, add milk to my shopping list." Done! Then Assistant came. I tried adding an item to the shopping list...and it created a new Google Assistant shopping list in Keep. WTF? I already have a shopping list, that's what I want to use. So, basically, I guess this doesn't affect me at this point because I've already had my nice, voice-activated shopping list taken away from me. I'll just stick with manually adding things in Keep and remembering back in 2004 when Google was cool... Rob Using Voice Search (Google Now) you can still add items to Keep! Abhimanyu Seth Since I found wunderlist, never looked at another app for shopping lists! Jose Romero More renewed focus on Google Express. This gives me a little bit more hope that Google might one day make a "Google Prime" that at least includes Google Express, Google Movies, and Google Music in the yearly subscription cost. Wynnded Keep app just got an update, lol. James Briano "OK, Google, add an iPhone to my shopping list." Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ No kidding. I'm getting more and more tempted to switch. Indefinite Implosion As someone with a work iPhone and only a Nexus 4 that has no SIM and little battery, don't. I miss Android. There's so many things about Android that I miss and have no good replacement for (such as Nine mail for Exchange). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ My kids have iPhones and I think they're terrific. I'd be happy with one, only I really like the S Pen too much to switch. But if Google pisses me off enough, I will switch. JD Do it you'll feel better, way less frustrated. Portzblitz You CAN'T use Google Express in about 5,292 US cities, sooo.. Is the wisdom of this intentionally hidden from us, or does this really, truly do no one- including Google- any good? b_boogey_xl *rabble rabble rabble* this one change ruins everything. how will I go on with life, my shopping list is ruined… *rabble rabble rabble* 🙄 disqus_3Gy5bmHRAv Yet another example of Google's haphazard policies towards apps. Android has become a complete frustration. The apps work differently on different devices, an app can be killed off at any minute based on a whim and important apps do not get enough attention because of Google's philosophy: Try everything, master nothing. Teja I need an option to add tasks to a to do list in keep through Google Assistant. Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher R.I.P. shopping with my watch :-( http://i.imgur.com/RuHrQnK.jpg There is still a way, much more complicated: 1. Make sure NOT to install Google Express 2. Open shopping list on the phone 3. Select all → Copy 4. Open Google Keep 5. Create new list 6. Paste 7. Remove extra line spacing → Now you can still use your watch in the store. Thank you Google. DragoCubed It makes total sense for a shopping list to be in keep. Google is trying to make itself a mess. I shouldn't be used to this Google, I shouldn't be afraid to recommend a Google messaging app. James Bray I am in the UK, and I'm not able to download the Google Express App, so I need to use the website. This wouldn't be the end of the world if I could get any mobile service in my local supermarket! With this change, they effectively just removed this feature from me entirely. I only set it up on the 6th because that's when the Home came out! Annoyed! Bubble Widgets + Wear Launcher See my other comment, you can still copy/paste the list to Keep Tamil Arasan A new assistant for me making things simple!!! Stefan Weißhampel It's a stupid move, especially for international users who simply use the US assistant because it is a few steps ahead of the several international versions. I'm not going to order eggs from the US. Empraim can the new shopping list give me location based notifications like Keep could? It was the best feature that my phone would buzz, giving me my shopping list as I entered the supermarket Filipe Santos They make a move thinking on everyone but in the end Google Express only exist on a very very few countries.... Filipe Santos Ok Google stop being an asshole and release Google assistant for everyone myssi How about they had updated Google Keep to have a little Google Express badge on any list item buyable from express while person in supported country and zip area?? Now even on saying "Create a list" on Google Assitant makes a Google Express list -___- Chicachica Wow what a load of crap, they took an awesome feature and instead of improving it, made it much worse. I sent feedback in the apps. Hopefully when enough people bitch like that they will change it back... Jason Pagliaro Sent detailed feedback as well. Unlikely that we'll see any change but worth a shot. Crossstick Ten thumbs down. It was perfect as a Keep interface. Now we have to manually enter items in a Keep shopping list. Brilliant, Google. Albert R I think you got that reversed: this is one step forward, two steps back. Albert R Just like killing of reader, the Hangouts chrome extension, and when they stopped using xmpp for chat. They really need better product direction/someone with common sense. makapav You're giving them too much credit - they actually lack any product direction. David Dalrymple This was not a well - thought decision. I hope Google rethinks this decision. bdbplatano Google is the dumbest smart company out there Martin Send your ANGRY thoughts to Google from the Assistant's FEEDBACK :-))) Let them know at least how much they SUCK... :-))) P.S: Don't expect change, it's not like Google ever gives a sh*t about their users... They are just dumb and ignorant most of the time :) makapav Feedback? I have up on it years ago. All that Hangouts feedback went to shit. They came up with Allo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Obvious attempt to get you to shop using Google Express instead of Amazon. SavageJeep and... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And it won't work. All this will do is piss off people who used Keep for shopping lists. SavageJeep I use Express. I use Amazon. Ordering stuff off my list makes sense. That is their intent and yes it is a business decision. EDIT: spelling Bodah My biggest complaint is that you can no longer reorder the list. In my usage, I would add items throughout the week, and then reorder the list based on the layout of the store before I left. That way I wouldn't be going from one end of the store to the other because I happened to add grapes at the end of the week. demarcmj You realize that's not an "umbrella icon" right? Graham Newman I was already disliking the way that assistant added reminders were not added to keep. But im a new convert from iOS. I thought keep was great at keeping reminders gathered in one place rather than spread all over my calendar but I just need to try to get used to it. I don't like the cal app much. Metal_Link Disappointed for the same reason as the author... Can't see my list on my watch. Ugh. Navarr Barnier two forward, one back? This is more like one forward two back. Aaron Dishman https://giphy.com/gifs/superstore-lauren-ash-26ueYRXkmpTVsB7K8 Kakairo It looks like I can share the list if I view it in a web browser, but not when I view it in Google Express. The hell? This was one of our most used features in the house, it will take a lot of getting used to. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The Google giveth and the Google taketh away. Blessed be the name of the Google. (This change is a transparent attempt to compete with Amazon.) create812 What is Google Express? Why can't I see my list on my watch? Why can't I check items off? How can my SO and I collaborate on the same shopping list? Oh no Google WHAT! is you doing? Roberto Virga "... have a tiny umbrella icon" From "don't be evil" to "resident evil": Google has now become Umbrella Corp. :D JD I can imagine the Google Lunch room now. You got different cliques sitting at different tables. None of them are allowed to sit in different cliques, you sit with your own and that's it. You got the G-Home Table, The Android Table, Android Wear table etc, G-Apps. Each one planning how to shank the other like in a prison. Then you have the guys who are in charge of Adopting Material design in to G-Apps walking around outside like giant chickens pecking at the ground crowing randomly at passerbys. Roy So they're basically removing the two things that I love about using keep for this: Android Wear Sharing the list with my wife (her phone has yet to get google assistant and neither of us can get the Google Express app). Good job Google. It must be nice to be able to consistently ignore and piss off your users because we're not really your customers, your advertisers are. Well, I hope one day you realize that your products will move to greener pastures when a company comes around that can do what you do but doesn't see us as widgets to be sold to advertisers, but as people that are the foundation of your income. Advertisers won't pay you a dime if you have no one to show their ads to! Cecil Hardwood Why are you guys surprised or disappointed ? This is Google. Look at messaging and reminders. Those are all over the place too. Google is becoming more and more incompetent. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome sucks now. It used to be my favorite browser. Unfortunately, there's no competition anymore. Edge sucks more. Firefox works great but is slow as fark. Opera is great, but it's based on Chrome. Merf This is as bad as it sounded. Vons Records Good move, Google. Now I'm back to having zero reasons to interact with the assistant. Except for telling it to shut up when it overhears me setting up the backup phone I use for flashing ROMs. R.J. Great, no widget for Express as well, so my shopping list isn't viewable with all my other notes on my home screen. Glich damit i use a extra home screen of my phone as one big keep wigget for my shopiing list. o well so much for that David Lloyd Thomas Sucks because Google Express isn't available in the UK! No way of accessing the list without adding something to it 😕😕 Jon Edge Maybe this has already been posted...I didn't read all the comments. I'm not saying this will solve everyone's issues, but it's at least a work around I can live with. Once the list is launched, you can pin it to your homescreen. That makes it easily accessible, As a matter of fact, it's one step shorter than accessing through Keep (unless you keep that list open all the time). Just now, I copied the address of that Chrome Tab and emailed that to myself. I launched that link on Chrome on my desktop and now I have that bookmarked in my Bookmarks Bar. Pretty easy access to my list on mobile and desktop. I can live with that. Who cares if they have integrated this new list with Google Express. Use it or don't. That really shouldn't be an issue for anyone. I'll bet this is only temporary anyway and that eventually this finds its way into the Google Home app (or somewhere else). LondonLeedsFan Is Google Express their attempt at Prime then? I wouldn't know as don't think it's in the UK. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yes. They want to compete with Amazon Prime because you can order stuff with the Amazon Echo. h4rr4r I don't understand the issue here. Just use keep, who the heck wants to yell at their phone? surethom No express in the UK & cellular signel In supermarkets is very bad so shopping list DOES NOT work in UK as it uses a web link, we NEED an offline sync version. xxTheGoDxx So, summarize: Google relies now on app not available outside of the US Express doesn't work on Android Wear, nor tablets from what I have read. You can instead open your shopping list in Chrome, which means you won't have access to it if the page / app reloads or you miss click unless you have a working data connection in your local grocery store / super market. Good job guys! BTW, when does your next totally useless messaging app launch? And have you ever thought about moving the ability to take selfies into Google Keep instead of the camera app? That would be so cool. thereasoner Perhaps Wear support is coming shortly? Learjet Bad decision to make Keep lose a huge hunk of it's capability just to promote a niche service that few people can access or use. This was not well thought out. Learjet Call it a "To Do List" in Keep. Problem solved. Realspear There goes the incentive to not use Evernote. derp_cookies The Hangouts team must be working on Keep & Google Assistant John Ventura This change really stinks. I don't stay logged into Chrome. The shopping list is one of the few things I used the assistant for with the Pixel phone. Dumb move Google. Tom Harriss My wife and I used the shopping lists from Google Home as our favorite feature of the device, and we both had Google Keep installed using the widget to display the shopping list on our home screens. Now when we want to see the lists, we have to click on Google Home, Click on the menu bar, click on "Shopping Lists" then wait while it opens a browser window, and view a list that shows about 1/2 the items at one time that the Keep widget did. This is very disappointing! Google needs to get its act together! If you add features without warning people, that is OK, but if you remove key features for no reason with no choices from users, you are being a very stupid software company! usnmustanger While this change may be "two steps forward, one step back" for the 4 people that actually use Google Express to buy stuff, for the rest of us (the overwhelming majority of Home users), this is most definitely 3 steps back. This may very well be the straw that breaks the camels back and makes me move to Amazon's platform. Also, how about a poll on AP asking who actually likes the change? Tenley H This is a pain for a number of reasons... the biggest one is I can't drag & drop to re-arrange my shopping list. I use it for groceries and organize everything by where it is in the store so I work my way down the list as I go through the store. So now if I add an item at one end of the store, an item at the other end of the store, then later need to add an item at the first end of the store it's just a mess!

Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by five million people. The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes — rich data on how people use a product — with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it? This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word of mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion (all figures US). Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients that it needs to compete with the giants. Last fall, Microsoft announced a direct Slack rival called Teams, to be given free to all 85 million users of its Office 365. At the same time, Facebook made its work collaboration tool, Workplace, widely available free. Atlassian, a smaller company, has signed big customers, too. As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology's largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams. Microsoft already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls. There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But chief executive Stewart Butterfield said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple's beating IBM in personal computing, Google's beating Microsoft in search and Facebook's crushing Google in social networks.           Slack is the product of Butterfield's second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005. In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people co-operated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack. Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has five million daily users, up from four million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable. Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome video conferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in "channels," typically organized around a few well-defined tasks. "The overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue" with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 1,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities. Collaboration software like Slack is not new. Google's Wave, which started in 2009 and shut down in 2012, was supposed to replace email with a messaging tool, but conversations were too hard to follow and track. Atlassian, an Australian software company, released a team collaboration platform in 2004 and acquired Slack's nearest startup rival, HipChat, in 2012. But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify.   Slack modelled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called "raccooning," it signifies, "Please take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic." In Slack's office in Vancouver, designers think about things like colour choice, layout and Slack's sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer's peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behaviour. "Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software," Slack wrote in an open letter to Microsoft that ran as a full-page ad in November in The New York Times.                             The battle between Slack and its rivals is essentially over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google. Slack wants to be in that pantheon — as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world's virtual conference room and water cooler. Slack's name — an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge — underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors. "Companies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship," said Sean Ryan, head of partnerships at Facebook's Workplace. "The No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated." "We're trying to build empathy at scale," Butterfield said. Slack's office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like "set out the towels" as they create new user features.   Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users' well-being. "There are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer," Butterfield said. "You really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we'll lose them." New York Times | Latest News Local  What’s in it for me?

Hint: It’s not a state Polis: Leave marijuana regulation to the states, Mr. Trump Google and Facebook are facing new competition to their online business models after President Donald Trump signed a bill putting internet service providers on a path to being able to monetize online users the same way these technology giants do. Next up is the threatened unwinding of the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules, which could put these companies in a double bind, because they could soon have to pay internet service providers a metered rate to move their content to customers’ screens. Google and Facebook will argue — as they did during our fight on net neutrality in 2015 — that ISPs should not be able to prioritize and price the flow of online content. The problem is that they make the exact opposite argument in their role as distributors of news content crucial to our democracy. The two digital giants increase or reduce users’ exposure to news content based on whether publishers — such as The Wall Street Journal or The Indianapolis Star — agree to play by their rules. Those rules are crafted to maximize the flow of advertising revenue, not quality content. Proponents of net neutrality, including Google and Facebook, persuaded the Federal Communications Commission to treat ISPs as “common carriers,” akin to traditional telephone companies. Under decades-old law, such entities are subject to high levels of government regulation on price, access and other consumer issues, all in the name of the public good. Because of the elevated levels of regulation, ISPs aren’t permitted to favor any content, regardless of consumer demand. Now that Ajit Pai — who has said that net neutrality’s “days are numbered” — has become chairman of the FCC, many think the agency will help ISPs reclaim the ability to set their own rules and “toggle” content based on revenue opportunity. News outlets, as creators of high-quality (and expensive) news content, like a level playing field and have supported net neutrality. But it would be hypocritical for Google and Facebook to be the faces of this fight, given their business models. The digital giants have become central to how millions of Americans consume their news, and as these companies rely on consumers’ ever-increasing appetites for news to capture their audiences, the business terms they dictate put intense stress on news industry economics. For example, Google requires publishers to offer “First Click Free” content, lest they be punished — with demoted content that doesn’t abide by the rules in search results. Facebook’s “Instant Articles” allows articles to load faster in user news feeds, even with the newly announced changes and trials, but doesn’t allow a simple or direct way to subscribe to a publication. Meanwhile, both companies pressure newsrooms’ bottom lines by soaking up online ad revenue. A study by Digital Content Next, a publishing trade group, found that major publishers with large digital operations earned only about 14 percent of their total revenue in the first half of last year from distribution platforms — and most of that was from YouTube. Smaller news publishers get peanuts. This debate — as well as the spread of fake news and questions about digital companies’ responsibility in weeding out false content — seems to be leading the tech giants into an increasingly fraught political landscape. Media reporter Michael Wolff observed that the Trump administration and Republican-controlled Congress are creating a “uniquely dangerous moment” for the digital industry as its “customers and employees demand that companies swear ever-more anti-Trump oaths.” Google and Facebook understand the burgeoning vulnerability in their positions. Each has teams to think through its relationships with news content providers. Facebook brought on former CNN anchor Campbell Brown to “help news organizations and journalists work more closely and more effectively with Facebook.” Although welcome, such outreach won’t be enough. Newsrooms have always cooperated with Facebook — so much so that they have co-opted their economic models. What’s really needed is a fair and sustainable split on the advertising income earned off breaking news and good reporting, not just more happy talk about the importance of journalism. As the net neutrality issue heats up again, Facebook’s and Google’s conflicting positions won’t go unnoticed. These companies argue that their content shouldn’t be prioritized based on revenue-driven decisions by ISPs, yet they are doing the same thing to news organizations. It’s an inconsistency that even ardent defenders of net neutrality will be unable to resolve. Something’s got to give.

Google’s Play Store is the largest app store on Android, but to put it on a phone, a manufacturer must abide by Google’s terms. The search engine giant has often used the Play Store as leverage to stop manufacturers from changing the default search engine on an Android device or bundling competing apps. In August last year, Russian authorities slapped a 438 million ruble ($6.75m) fine on Google, concluding that the company was “forcing its partners to feature its services”. The anti-trust case was originally filed by Yandex, who claimed that Google violated Russia’s competition rules. Google will still have to pay that fine, but in an out-of-court settlement with the Federal Antimonopoly Service of the Russian Federation, it has agreed to loosen its hold on Android. The terms of the agreement state that Google will no longer demand exclusivity for its applications on Android devices in Russia, and will not restrict manufacturers from pre-installing competing search engines or applications. Google will also drop its requirement of being the only search engine that comes pre-installed on Android devices, and will no longer enforce any existing agreements where manufacturers had agreed to do so. According to FAS, Google will also have to develop a “Chrome widget” that will replace the standard Google search widget on the Android home screen. This widget will prompt users with a “choice screen,” where they can select between Yandex, Google, or any other search engine who may sign a commercial agreement with Google for inclusion on this list. The term for this agreement is six years and nine months; Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh wrote a blog post thanking Russia’s FAS and Google: I am thankful to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for applying the law in a manner that effectively and efficiently restores competition to the market for the benefit of Russian users. I also want to thank Google, not only for their cooperation, but also for recognizing the value of openness. We have always thought Google plays a constructive role in the Russian market. Competition breeds innovation. It’s our desire to participate in a market where users can choose the best services available. In a statement, a Google spokesperson confirmed the settlement: We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia’s competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android. The deal also has wider implications beyond Russia, setting a precedent for cases around the world where governments and companies have complained that Google is abusing its dominant position. Google is battling against similar anti-trust cases in the EU, where BT recently took the search giant’s side.

Normangee Star Finance Market Industry Companies People Contacts About Our staff Contacts Terms of use Privacy Russia, Google reach $7.8 million settlement on Android case 17.04.2017 Madeline Patrick 0 Comment Google has reached a settlement with Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) agency in the antitrust case the Russian search rival Yandex had originally filed, claiming Google had violated local competition rules. Google is to pay all fines imposed by FAS. Russian officials and Google have reached an agreement to settle a two-year-old case against Google for requiring the pre-installation of some of its apps on mobile devices using the Android system. In time, FAS imposed additional fines against Google, amounting to almost 1 million rubles in total. Under the settlement, Google can not stop smartphone makers from pre-installing competing search engine apps on their devices. Google will also develop a new widget for Chrome that will allow buyers of new devices to choose their default search engine, FAS said. “The commercial agreement with Yandex, which was approved by the FAS, provides additional opportunities for the promotion of the Yandex search service in the Chrome browser, thus ending the dispute regarding the distribution of Google services on Android-devices”, Google explains. The deal also makes it possible for other applications to be pre-installed on Android devices in Russian Federation. The settlement, announced Monday, ends a almost two-year investigation by FAS into Google’s control of the Android operating system. ← Bank of America Corp (BAC) Scheduled to Post Quarterly Earnings on Tuesday Major newspapers in Serbia hit stands with same front pages → Recent Posts President Erdogan hails win, opposition call for recount in Turkey referendum Police urge man who posted video of murder to turn self in EVENT CANCELLED: Underwater egg hunt set for Saturday Manhunt underway for Steve Stephens who livestreamed homicide in Cleveland Huge Alexis Sanchez Contract Could Put Arsenal ‘In Trouble’- Arsene Wenger Copyright © 2017 Normangee Star.

The evolution of (and solution to) ransomware Video Hands-On with the Galaxy S6 Edge+ In Android, apps aren’t supposed to be able to interfere with the normal behavior of other apps or the device itself. But ransomware is notorious for taking over other apps and encrypting data, and it can even block the uninstall command. It’s been a long-standing problem for Google’s Android mobile operating system. “Ransomware does everything opposite of what the Android security model says apps should do,” says Android security team malware analyst Elena Kovakina. Google is tackling the ransomware problem on Android by beefing up app protections, deprecating certain APIs, and removing functionality, she says. Google has made antimalware improvements in the current Android Nougat, and more are slated for the forthcoming Android O. [ The 10 best features in Android O (so far). | InfoWorld’s Mobile Security Deep Dive. Download it today in your choice of PDF or ePub editions! | Keep up on key mobile developments and insights with the Mobile Tech Report newsletter. ] Ransomware isn’t as big of a threat on mobile devices as it has been on the desktop, but it does exist. Kovakina notes that Google tracked 30 Android ransomware families in the wild and collected 50,000 samples to learn how the malware behaved, what kind of API calls it abused, and what operating system processes it targeted. Android ransomware variants tend to target older operating system versions; Cyber.Police, for example, exploited Android Ice Cream Sandwich, Jelly Bean, and KitKat devices a year ago. The malware locked up the devices’ home screens and demanded Apple iTunes gift cards in exchange for the decryption key to unlock the phones. Victims of mobile ransomware have a guaranteed recovery method that’s not available to desktop victims: the factory reset. Users who regularly back up files and important settings minimize data loss as a result of the malware encrypting the data or from a device reset. The Android security team has not yet encountered any ransomware samples capable of encrypting Google’s cloud backup, Kovakina says, and “we haven’t yet seen ransomware that can survive factory reset.” Google’s past actions: Deprecate, remove functionality In the past, Google tackled the ransomware problem by deprecating API calls used by the malware. For example, DeviceAdmin, which asks the user to grant the app administrator privileges, was being abused by 70 percent of ransomware to gain elevated privileges on the affected device. DeviceAdmin is typically used by security apps and mobile device management tools to get administrator privileges. Potentially harmful apps or malware would repeatedly display the DeviceAdmin prompt, in hopes of annoying the user into granting the app administrator privileges, essentially creating a denial-of-service condition against the user interface. The security team addressed this particular issue by changing the DeviceAdmin prompt in Android Nougat to include an obvious option to uninstall the app engaging in this kind of behavior. In another tactic, malware that popped up activity windows as persistent overlays while other apps were running were abusing the getRunningTasks method in the Activity Manager, which lets apps find out what other tasks are running on Android. This method was deprecated in API level 21, and as of Android Lollipop, it’s no longer available to third-party apps. Mobile developers who previously used getRunningTasks should now use oom_score, which requires going through the proc/ directory to find running apps. The hidepid function in Android Nougat controls who gets to use the information in the directory. The security model in Android Nougat was also changed, so apps now need granular access to music, docs, and photos to reduce potential damage from encryption. New defenses coming in Android O The developer preview of Android O was released March 21, and the API is “getting a complete overhaul,” Kovakina says. To control what kind of windows can be displayed above other apps, apps using the O SDK will no longer be allowed to use the window types TYPE_PHONE, TYPE_PRIORITY_PHONE, TYPE_SYSTEM_ALERT, TYPE_SYSTEM_OVERLAY, or TYPE_SYSTEM_ERROR. Instead, developers will have to use the new window type TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY. Apps using older SDK versions can still use those window types, but their windows will be z-ordered below the new TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY windows. An ongoing low-priority notification is displayed in the window for all apps using the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, regardless of whether it’s using the new window type or one of the older ones.  All alert windows will be z-ordered below critical system windows like the lockscreen or the status bar. This means users will always be able to switch away from the alert windows. Google will keep tinkering There is a bit of a cat-and-mouse game being played. Many of the system improvements seen in latest versions of Android were inspired by a type of malware that successfully executed on a device. Malware creators will look for new tricks as Google addresses their current ones. Google’s aim is to make it more difficult and costlier for attackers to build mobile malware. Kovakina acknowledges that users don’t always have the latest version, which is why Google has beefed up its Verify Apps tool’s ability to detect ransomware in the Google Play Store. Instead of warning of ransomware, Verify Apps now blocks suspected ransomware apps. Related: Malware Android Security Mobile Fahmida Y.

The settlement came with a fine as Google was made to pay $7.8 million to the Russian antimonopoly body. The search engine giant will also open up its Android operating system to other search engines in Russia. Google will also not continue to prevent other companies’ apps from coming preinstalled. The agreement also means Google search will no longer enjoy the monopoly of being the only search engine on Android. Implementation of the settlement’s terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications. We managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices. The settlement’s execution will have a positive effect on the market as a whole, while giving developers additional options for promoting their products,” – Igor Artemiev, Head of the FAS Russia said on Monday. Two years ago, Yandex also referred to as Russia’s version of Google search engine urged authorities in that country to open an antitrust probe against the American search giant for possibly violating the Russian antitrust law. This came on the heels of antitrust probe of Google by the European Commission for similar worries raised by other competitors in the market, who express fear over the search engine’s dominance of the market. Competitors are worried that Google’s influence in the search engine market may not create a level playing field for all. Yandex, amongst other reasons urged FAS to stop the bundling of Google’s operating system with apps on mobile devices. Yandex claimed that Google was “using its dominant position to promote its search and services,” said its chief executive Arkady Volozh. He further said: “the user should be king” of choosing best applications.” Google’s continued growth and dominance of the market in Russia is attributed to the popularity of its Android devices according to analysts. Yandex, according to WSJ, is the most installed operating system on 86% of all mobile devices being sold in Russia, and this gives Google the edge. The petition filed by Yandex got FAS to carry out investigation into alleged monopoly by Google. The outcome of the investigation was what led FAS to impose a fine $6.7 million on the search engine giant at the time. Google was fined $6.75 million by the FAS for violating its antitrust rules on mobile phones and tablets—a ruling that was issued in 2015. The FAS had issued Google a one-month ultimatum last October to get rid of apps from phones—an order in which the company failed to comply with. Google, however, insisted that its reason for not complying with the order was based on how revenue generated from ads from the services it renders cover costs of providing its OS at no cost. Google is also being investigated by the European Commission for violating its antitrust regulation on competition. Last year, Margarethe Vestager, the European Commission’s antitrust commissioner said the antitrust body was “closely” monitoring Google’s contract with carriers and mobile manufacturers. Vestager’s concern was aimed at requirements Google places on its partners to have devices pre-installed with its apps. “Our concern is that, by requiring phone makers and operators to pre-load a set of Google apps, rather than letting them decide for themselves which apps to load, Google might have cut off one of the main ways that new apps can reach customers,” she said.

"Nevada is rapidly becoming a technology and innovation hub by attracting exciting new startups and some of the world’s best names. "I am excited by the prospects that come with this size of purchase from this type of company," Sandoval said. "As with all businesses, the state stands ready as a willing and friendly partner in the development of this site." Google joins Tesla and Switch Supernap as high-profile tech tenants among the more than 100 companies that are associated with the expansive site east of Reno-Sparks. 0 Join the Discussion: Check this out for a full explanation of our conversion to the LiveFyre commenting system and instructions on how to sign up for an account.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 31 Plus 1 on G+ 104 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares206 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. Scott Breitbach How is '60s surf music going to help a ghost problem? Scott Breitbach Or were they the '60s R&B guys? kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Đức Thành I guess you missed the part where I said 6 smart home devices weren't any where near enough. Bring me 16 and we're talking. :D Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? SavageJeep Oh, god. People are buying none of these cutting edge technological products. Are they poor or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library. Paul Quinn I can access a single song, an album, any of my playlists, or a Google Music Playlist. I can access music from my library or from Play Music's entire catalog. I am subscribed to Google Play Music. It's possible you are seeing this if you do not have a subscription. However, you should be able to access Google's curated lists. Michael I do have the subscription. I find this really odd. Can you verify you are able to play a song that exists only in your library and not available from Play Music? How did you ask for it to be played? I have a song in my library called Alligator.MP3 as well as many others and she cannot play it. There is an entire thread on this feature not being available so I would really appreciate it if you can double check. Thanks https://productforums.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/googlehome/zC9dUi3FUsk/3W6KPacnAgAJ Paul Quinn I stand corrected! It is difficult to find songs only in my library and not in GP's library but I found a couple and it will not play them on the Home. That link in the product forum has an answer that says it should work. Am I reading that wrong? It's marked as "Best Answer." Michael Well, it should work if/when Google supports it. The bad thing is they are completely mum on the subject and won't really commit on it. People who report it are being given the old "we'll send your feedback to to the developers​.". Every other Android device works as we expect it to but not Home. It will only play your playlists and that doesn't depend on the subscription. Julie Ankrom I'm seeing a niche service here, where you buy one or more "friends" and they respond to you via a particular Google Home. You can say, "Max, what do you think of the Reds this season?" or even "Everyone, what are you doing today?" and get responses. Going somewhere? Take your Google Home "friend" with you. Google home "friend parties"! Watch TV shows or movies with your "friends". A stay at home job for the "friends" and a whole new industry. Anthony DeRobertis Well, if you've got a Opera Ghost haunting your house, you'd best keep box five empty. I hear the chandeliers will start falling on you if you don't ☺. Odd it doesn't work—it seems to mostly work (in a not so great way) with assistant on a phone (normally, I ask the phone to text someone, and Google Home interrupts and announces it can't text yet—thanks, Google). It works with Echos, though. I have a bunch of Echos and Echo Dots, and (ever since the update that added it), I've never had multiple ones respond. It's not always the closest one that responds (especially if the closest one has a bunch of background noise nearby), but never more than one. I don't even have all the Echos on the same access point (though they're all on the same network). Google Home seems better at answering random questions than Echo, I just wish Google were as good as Amazon at making a product actually work (and that's not asking for much). Google Home has a lot more false activations than the Echos, too (though I think the Echos have now erred too far on that side, and sometimes I have to yell at them to activate them.) F4LL0U7 Could you avoid all of that (and save hundreds of dollars) by saying "OK Google" to your phone or your watch, if you have a smart watch?

Forums Join   Charter Runs Ads Mocking Google Fiber Struggles by Karl Bode Monday Apr 17 2017 16:10 EDT Large incumbent ISPs have begun taking full advantage of Google Fiber's recent missteps. Last fall Google Fiber announced that the company would be firing its CEO, shifting around some staff, and putting some existing fiber builds on hold. The announcements came as numerous leaks suggested Google execs were growing tired of the slow pace, high cost, and relatively low uptake of the company's existing fiber offerings -- and were pondering a shift to wireless. But Google Fiber hasn't exactly been helping its case by repeatedly pretending nothing's really wrong. For example, while Google Fiber repeatedly claimed its existing ongoing fiber builds wouldn't be impacted, users in Kansas City have complained that their installs are being cancelled after nearly two years of waiting. While we know it's because Google Fiber executives don't really appear to know what the next step is while they wait for ongoing wireless trials to bear fruit, the company's non-answers have been frustrating for waiting customers. Incumbent ISPs, many of which were forced to ramp up their own broadband deployments and lower their prices in Google Fiber markets, are arguably thrilled by the company's recent struggles. And now Charter Communications is running ads in Kansas City highlighting how Google Fiber has "abandoned" these would-be customers (see ad, above left). The ads are quick to point out how Kansas City was selected way back in 2011 as the first Google Fiber city, and how six years later the company still hasn't delivered on its promises to many area locals. Of course Charter, which has yet to offer speeds faster than 100 Mbps in many markets, has had problems of its own lately. Many of the company's customers are saying they're seeing higher prices and even worse support in the wake of Charter's $79 billion acquisition of Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. As such, running from the failed promises of Google Fiber to the often failed delivery of Charter may not be much of a "solution" for these impacted customers, especially if they're looking for next-generation gigabit speeds (which Charter doesn't even provide). While there's likely not much Google Fiber can do to speed up its next-gen wireless experiments, it's becoming clear the company needs to do a significantly better job at convincing consumers that its entire vision isn't unraveling before their eyes. tags: competition · business · alternatives · bandwidth · content · consumers · Google · Charter · Google Fiber · gigabit News Jump »Charter Runs Ads Mocking Google Fiber StrugglesGoogle Fiber Revamps San Antonio Network After ComplaintsMonday Morning Links 'Nobody's Got to Use the Internet,' Says Rep. on Privacy VoteISPs Gave 8X More Cash to Politician That Axed FCC Privacy RuleT-Mobile Hopes $8 Billion Spectrum Buy Helps It Topple VerizonNetworking 101: HomePNAComcast Will Soon be Free of NBC Merger ConditionsWeekend Open Thread!Friday Morning Links----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Most recommended from 22 comments tshirt Premium Member join:2004-07-11 Snohomish, WA124.8 11.9 tshirt Premium Member Yesterday 4:38 pm On the other hand...

Scroll Staff Published Yesterday · 05:45 am.   Pixabay/Creative Commons licence Yesterday · 05:45 am.   Scroll Staff Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Share Tweet Email Reddit Print Sex determination laws versus free speech The Supreme Court last week asked search engines like Google, Yahoo and Microsoft to ban all advertisements for sex determination tests. However, the court also observed that while there should be a restriction on such ads, a general ban on all online content pertaining to sex determination was dangerous and would amount to curtailing a person’s fundamental right to know. The court was deliberating on a PIL by activist Sabu George seeking a complete ban on all online searches related to pre-natal sex determination on the grounds that such tests are illegal under Indian law. The Pre-Conception Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (Prohibition of Sex Selection) Act, of 1994 prohibits sale of sex determination kits or their promotion by way of advertisements. In February, the court had asked search engines like Google and Yahoo to implement mechanisms to identify and block content relating to pre-natal sex determination. The companies had opposed the directive and free speech activists have also pointed out that it could lead to censorship of content on the Internet by private parties. On Tuesday last week the court free speech consideration against the sex-determination laws. “Prenatal sex determination ads is an offence,” a three-judge Bench led by Justice Dipak Misra observed, according to a report in The Hindu. “But a general prohibitory order against all online information pertaining to sex determination is dangerous. We will be curtailing the right to know under Article 19 (1) (a) of the Constitution.” On Thursday, the court heard the matter again and passed and asked the search engines to prohibit advertisements relating to sex-determination tests but did not impose a complete ban on all such searches. NPPA issues notices to hospitals The National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority has started issuing notices to hospitals for not complying with its new guidelines on coronary stents. In early February the drug pricing regulator brought stents under price control and capped the price of the devices at Rs 7,260 for bare metal stents and Rs 29,600 for drug-eluting stents. Between February 14 to March 15, the NPPA has found violations of this price cap in as many 40 health institutions. In a notification on Friday, the NPPA announced that it had issued show cause notices to the managements of hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions to recover the money they made by overcharging cardiac patients for stents. The regulator has also sent pre-prosecution notices under The Essential Commodities Act, 1955 to institutions in violation of its February order. Meanwhile, advocate Birender Sangwan has filed PILs at the Delhi High Court against 18 hospitals in Delhi, Mumbai and Pune for overcharging cardiac stents. Sangwan’s earlier PIL had led to the NPPA slashing of prices of cardiac stents by about 85% in February. The Maharashtra Food and Drug Administration had stepped up its vigilance as a part of its larger plan to detect overpricing of stents after the NPPA received complaints about stents being sold at higher prices at KEM Hospital, Lilavati Hospital and a few hospitals in Pune and Nashik. Status update of complaints of overcharging against hospitals on cardiac stent prices (as on 29/3/2017) https://t.co/06OypfN2RU— NPPAindia (@nppa_india) March 30, 2017 Indian Medical Association against West Bengal law The Indian Medical Association has decided to move court questioning the validity of a new law passed by the West Bengal government to regulate clinical establishments. The Clinical Establishments (Registration, Regulation and Transparency) Act, 2017 seeks to address medical negligence by allowing fines on erring doctors and also imprisonment for certain violations. The Indian Medical Association has, however, been protesting what it calls the “criminalisation of doctors”. The association’s president KK Aggarwal said that the body’s legal cell was looking into the possibility of opposing the unconstitutional provisions of the Act, which include the fines imposed on top of the penalties imposed by the Consumer Protection Act and the exemption of government hospitals from the purview of the Act. Aggarwal said that these provisions are unfair and cannot make for universally acceptable law that seeks to prevent medical negligence. The association is also planning to hold political protests and observe “National IMA Black Day” on April 27. We welcome your comments at letters@scroll.in.

After catching up on email, she connects with her colleagues to discuss, exchange notes and crunch numbers coming in from across India and the world. Shreya who works out of the café most of the time, is employed with an MNC and is a ‘remote worker’. At her company headquarters, there are many who defy the stereotype of a big company workforce - the marketing professional who by necessity is a ‘meeting-hopper’ on the office campus or those who have no fixed desks and are often found hobnobbing with their colleagues in the corridors for work. There are also the typical deskbound knowledge workers. These represent a new breed of professionals in India. Gone are the days when an employee was bound to a desk and the timings of the workplace – the new set of professionals thrive on flexibility which leads to better creativity and productivity as well as work-life balance. There is one common thread to all of them – technology, tailored to their work styles, which delivers on speed and ease of interactions. Several influential industry studies and economists have predicted that digital technologies have been as impactful as the Industrial Revolution in shaping the way people work. India is at the forefront of this change because of the lack of legacy barriers, a fast-growing economy and young workers. Five factors are enabling the birth of this new workforce: Smart is the way forward According to the Future Workforce Study conducted by Dell, three in five working Indians surveyed said that they were likely to quit their job if their work technology did not meet their standards. Everyone knows the frustration caused by slow or broken technology – in fact 41% of the working Indians surveyed identified this as the biggest waste of time at work. A ‘Smart workplace’ translates into fast, efficient and anytime-anywhere access to data, applications and other resources. Technology adoption is thus a major factor in an employee’s choice of place of work. Openness to new technologies While young professionals want their companies to get the basics right, they are also open to new technologies like Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality and Artificial Intelligence. The Dell study clearly reflects this trend — 93% of Indians surveyed are willing to use Augmented/Virtual Reality at work and 90% say Artificial Intelligence would make their jobs easier. The use of these technologies is no longer just a novelty project at firms. For example, ThysenKrupp, the elevator manufacturer uses VR to help its maintenance technician visualize an elevator repair job before he reaches the site. In India, startups such as vPhrase and Fluid AI are evolving AI solutions in the field of data processing and predictive analysis. Desire for flexibility  A majority of Indians surveyed rate freedom to bring their own devices (laptops, tablets, smartphones etc.) to work very highly. This should not be surprising, personal devices are usually highly customized to an individual’s requirements and help increase their productivity. For example, some may prefer a high-performance system while others may prioritize portability over anything else. Half the working Indians surveyed also feel that the flexibility of work location enhances productivity and enables better work-life balance. Work-life balance is fast emerging as one of the top drivers of workplace happiness for employees and initiatives aimed at it are finding their way to the priority list of business leaders. Maintaining close collaboration  While flexible working is here to stay, there is great value in collaborating in person in the office. When people work face to face, they can pick up verbal and body language cues, respond to each other better and build connections. Thus, companies are trying to implement technology that boosts seamless collaboration, even when teams are working remotely. Work place collaboration tools like Slack and Trello help employees keep in touch and manage projects from different locations. The usage of Skype has also become common. Companies like Dell are also working on hi-tech tools such as devices which boost connectivity in the most remote locations and responsive videos screens which make people across geographies feel like they are interacting face to face. Rise of Data Security  All these trends involve a massive amount of data being stored and exchanged online. With this comes the inevitable anxiety around data security. Apart from more data being online, security threats have also evolved to become sophisticated cyber-attacks which traditional security systems cannot handle. The Dell study shows that about 74% of those surveyed ranked data security measures as their number one priority. This level of concern about data security has made the new Indian workforce very willing to consider new solutions such as biometric authentication and advanced encryption in work systems. Technology is at the core of change, whether in the context of an enterprise as a whole, the workforce or the individual employee. Dell, in their study of working professionals, identified five distinct personas — the Remote Workers, the On-The-Go Workers, the Desk-centric Workers, the Corridor Warriors and the Specialized Workers. Dell has developed a range of laptops in the Dell Latitude series to suit each of these personas and match their requirements in terms of ease, speed and power. To know more about the ‘types of professionals’ and how the Dell Latitude laptops serve each, see here.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Alphabet Inc.’s stock may have underperformed many of its peers over the past year, but analysts at Credit Suisse say that is set to change. While Facebook’s FB, +1.46%   stock has increased 29% in the past year and Amazon’s AMZN, +1.96% has rocketed 44%, Google parent Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.78% GOOG, +1.65%  shares are up just 10%. But that underperformance relative to its big-cap rivals could soon change as YouTube and Google Cloud take up a larger piece of its total revenue pie. Read also: Alphabet downgraded on threat from Amazon On Monday, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju reiterated an outperform rating and $1,100 12-month price target on the stock. That target, which is among the most bullish on Alphabet’s stock, would catapult Alphabet’s market capitalization to $757 billion, above Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.55%  valuation. Apple’s market cap is $745 billion, though RBC separately predicted on Monday that it’d grow to $824 billion within the year. Shares of Alphabet soared 1.8% to close at $855.13 on Monday. They’ve increased 3.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the S&P 500. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all outperformed over same time period, gaining 11%, 18% and 10.5%, respectively. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $982.26, according to a FactSet survey. In a note to clients released Monday morning, Credit Suisse increased its cloud revenue estimate, added in additional revenue Google is expected to make from the newly-announced YouTube TV streaming service and forecast a larger-than-expected contribution from Google’s non-search business, including Google Cloud and Google Play. See also: YouTube TV promises 50 major broadcast, cable channels for $35 a month Among the problem areas are larger investments to enhance its cloud services business, which have weighed on profit growth and margins. Another worry that has dampened investor sentiment has been the deceleration of Google’s established search business, though Ju said that has caused investors to overlook some of the fast-growing aspects of Google’s business, such as the cloud. Mobile Ads Fuel Facebook Revenue Boost(2:29) Advertising gains helped Facebook drive 30 percent more revenue per user in the fourth quarter, ahead of an anticipated slowdown in growth later this year. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. Photo: Bloomberg News YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud, while often are overshadowed by Google Search, are expected to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years, according to Credit Suisse. Last quarter, Google’s web sites raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, comprising 85% of total sales. Also Read: YouTube to require 10,000 views before videos can get ads In its last earnings report, Google attributed much of its 22% year-over-year increase in quarterly revenues to mobile search and YouTube.

The settlement ends a two-year fight with Russian antitrust regulators. The Russian FAS agency in 2015 found Google was violating competition laws by including its own search tool on the operating system, reports Reuters. ADVERTISEMENT Google would preload its own apps, including the search engine, on phones running Android. Russian users didn't have the option of changing to a different search engine on those phones. Now, under the terms of the settlement, the Android operating system will no longer exclusively have Google apps preinstalled in Russia, and users will be able to pick their default search engines, according to the FAS. The $7.8 million fine is roughly 9 percent of Google's 2014 revenue in Russia. The decision will give an opportunity for the Russian search engine Yandex NV to increase its own market share in mobile search. Yandex had originally brought the complaint against Google. The settlement also comes as Google fights similar antitrust allegations from the European Union over its mobile operating system. The Mountain View, Calif.-based company also faces probes from EU competition regulators over its adwords program and shopping search. Google has vigorously defended itself against the allegations, saying that it faces significant competition in Europe. Google has argued that the EU's analysis unfairly excludes Apple as a competitor. Google also insists its practices benefit consumers.   View the discussion thread.

Blue Link Agent for the Google Assistant debuts with the 2018 Hyundai Sonata models. The announcement was made during the 2017 New York International Auto Show. The Hyundai Blue Link Agent for the Google Assistant allows control of various functions of a Hyundai vehicle with simple voice commands. These voice commands can include 'Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start my car and set the temperature to 82 degrees', 'Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to send the address of the Empire State Building to my car Sonata', and 'Ok Google, ask Blue Link to unlock my vehicle'. 2018 Hyundai Sonata To make these voice features available to even more Hyundai car owners, Blue Link Connected Care, Remote and Guidance packages are now free for three years on all 2018 Hyundai models and the 2017 IONIQ lineup. Google Home is a voice-activated speaker powered by the Google Assistant that can provide real-time answers, activate streaming music services, smart home devices, and now, cars. Android Wear or Apple Watch Blue Link brings seamless connectivity directly into Hyundai cars with technologies including Remote Start with Climate Control, Destination Search powered by Google, Remote Door Lock / Unlock, Car Finder, Enhanced Roadside Assistance, and Stolen Vehicle Recovery. Blue Link services can be easily accessed from the buttons on the rearview mirror and center stack, the web or via the Blue Link owners' smartphone app. In addition to the action on the Google Assistant, some of these features can also be controlled via the latest Android Wear and Apple Watch smartwatch offerings. Hyundai electric vehicle with Google Assistant To send commands to the Hyundai Vehicles via the Google Assistant on Google Home, engineers developed a way to link a customer's Blue Link Account with the Google Assistant voice activated services. Once a customer has successfully linked his or her account, Remote Service commands will only be sent to Hyundai vehicles after the Google Assistant prompts owners for their Blue Link Personal Identification Number (PIN). Blue Link action on Google Home demonstration features include: Sending a destination to the car's navigation system, remote horn/lights, start and stop charging of Hyundai electric and plug-in vehicles, remote start with climate control, remote lock and unlock.    Previous  2017 Hyundai IONIQ models with remote service    News by brand:Hyundai    News by category:Android Auto    News by brand and category:Hyundai Android Auto Latest Hyundai announcements 2017 Hyundai IONIQ models with remote service Hyundai mobile phones   Latest news headlines 2018 Hyundai Sonata with Google Assistant 2017 Hyundai IONIQ models with remote service Why you should buy a QLED Smart TV New Gear smartwatch apps Garmin premium GPS sports watch Samsung mobile handsets deliver premium sound Samsung Smart TVs on display at 2017 QLED Forum Panasonic Lumix TZ90 zoom camera Samsung 2017 TV promotion videos Nintendo Switch best-selling game system QLED International Forum 2017 What makes QLED TVs better Sony gains ground in Full-Frame DSLR camera market New Gear smartwatch faces OnePlus 5 gets premium specs       5G Accessories Android Galaxy iPhone Camera Mobile phones Rumors Premium Smartphones Smartwatches Tablets TV   CES CeBIT IFA Photokina PMA

Action Alerts PLUS Action Alerts OPTIONS Daily Swing Trade Income Seeker Quant Ratings Real Money Real Money Pro Stocks Under $10 Top Stocks Trifecta Stocks Real Money Pro Portfolio Chairman's Club Compare All Google's Android Settlement With Russian Regulators Bodes Well for Its future Eric Jhonsa Apr 17, 2017 4:42 PM EDT Of the dozens of acquisitions Alphabet/Google (GOOGL) has made over its history, none -- not even its $1.6 billion 2006 purchase of YouTube -- arguably tops its $50 million purchase of a mobile software developer called Android in 2005 in terms of either financial payoff or long-term strategic value. Not only did the deal help Google eventually possess the most widely-used mobile OS in an era where a smartphone is the main computing device for hundreds of millions of people, it allowed the company's well-monetized services to be baked into a majority of the world's phones, and typically at a low cost to Google. But this very lucrative business model has come under fire over the last couple of years, as regulators in Washington, Brussels and Moscow probe complaints from disgruntled rivals. If the settlement that Google just struck with Russian regulators is a sign of things to come, the probes will hurt Android's profitability to Google a bit, but won't do massive damage. Seventeen months after Russia's antitrust watchdog ruled that Google is abusing its mobile market position by requiring that phones running Google Android pre-install the company's apps and services, Google has agreed to stop demanding its offerings be exclusively pre-installed on Android phones sold in Russia, and pay a modest $7.8 million fine. The company will also replace the Google Search widget that appears on Android home screens with a Chrome browser widget that lets Russian users select their default Chrome search engine. Russian search firm Yandex (YNDX) , whose local market share has been gradually dropping thanks to Google's strong mobile position, was up 6.7% today in New York. Though research firm LiveInternet estimates Yandex has a 55% Russian search share to Google's 40%, Yandex claims it has only a 38% share on Google Android. However, Alphabet's shares rose 1.8% today, amid a 0.9% gain for the Nasdaq. A bullish Credit Suisse note seems to be helping, but so might the specifics of the Russian settlement. While Google is no longer allowed to prevent a mobile OEM such as Samsung  (SSNLF) or Huawei from pre-installing rival third-party apps/services on their Android phones, it isn't prevented (from all indications) from continuing to require that its own apps/services be pre-installed. Google has defended such requirements with the solid argument that it incurs R&D, intellectual property and other costs to support Android, and with the OS given away for free, app/service bundling is the only way it can recoup its expenses. This means Google's very profitable Search app should still be pre-installed. As will other monetized apps such as YouTube, Maps, Gmail and of course Google Play. Mobile search and YouTube ad growth led Google's paid ad clicks/views to rise 36% annually in the fourth quarter. Moreover, while Google's new Chrome widget will make it easier for Russian consumers to use Yandex and other rival search engines, it won't allow a rival offering to be Chrome's default search engine out of the box either. And should Google agree to provide a similar tool for U.S. and EU consumers, one has to assume most of them will choose Google as their default engine, given its dominant search share in both regions. The fact Google Search can also now be accessed on Android phones by saying "OK, Google" or pressing and holding the home button doesn't hurt either. One negative side-effect to losing the right to demand Google Search exclusivity is that Google may have to give OEMs a larger ad revenue cut to have a Google Search widget appear on a phone's main home screen. As it is, mobile revenue-sharing deals -- including one with Apple (AAPL) to make Google the default search engine for the Safari browser on iOS devices -- led Google's traffic acquisition costs to grow to 10% of the ad revenue recorded on Google's own sites in the fourth quarter from 8% a year earlier.

By JenniferBooton Reporter Alphabet Inc.’s stock may have underperformed many of its peers over the past year, but analysts at Credit Suisse say that is set to change. While Facebook’s FB, +1.46%   stock has increased 29% in the past year and Amazon’s AMZN, +1.96% has rocketed 44%, Google parent Alphabet’s GOOGL, +1.78% GOOG, +1.65%  shares are up just 10%. But that underperformance relative to its big-cap rivals could soon change as YouTube and Google Cloud take up a larger piece of its total revenue pie. Read also: Alphabet downgraded on threat from Amazon On Monday, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Ju reiterated an outperform rating and $1,100 12-month price target on the stock. That target, which is among the most bullish on Alphabet’s stock, would catapult Alphabet’s market capitalization to $757 billion, above Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.55%  valuation. Apple’s market cap is $745 billion, though RBC separately predicted on Monday that it’d grow to $824 billion within the year. Shares of Alphabet soared 1.8% to close at $855.13 on Monday. They’ve increased 3.3% in the past three months, virtually in-line with the S&P 500. Amazon, Apple and Facebook have all outperformed over same time period, gaining 11%, 18% and 10.5%, respectively. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average price target is $982.26, according to a FactSet survey. In a note to clients released Monday morning, Credit Suisse increased its cloud revenue estimate, added in additional revenue Google is expected to make from the newly-announced YouTube TV streaming service and forecast a larger-than-expected contribution from Google’s non-search business, including Google Cloud and Google Play. See also: YouTube TV promises 50 major broadcast, cable channels for $35 a month Among the problem areas are larger investments to enhance its cloud services business, which have weighed on profit growth and margins. Another worry that has dampened investor sentiment has been the deceleration of Google’s established search business, though Ju said that has caused investors to overlook some of the fast-growing aspects of Google’s business, such as the cloud. Mobile Ads Fuel Facebook Revenue Boost(2:29) Advertising gains helped Facebook drive 30 percent more revenue per user in the fourth quarter, ahead of an anticipated slowdown in growth later this year. WSJ's Lee Hawkins explains. Photo: Bloomberg News YouTube, Google Play and Google Cloud, while often are overshadowed by Google Search, are expected to make up one-third of Alphabet’s total revenue within three years, according to Credit Suisse. Last quarter, Google’s web sites raked in nearly $18 billion in revenue, comprising 85% of total sales.

The latest has the Android client adopt a bottom bar in line with many of Google’s other Material apps… Nintendo Switch Like Google Photos and Play Newsstand, YouTube now uses black icons with text labels underneath on a white background. In fact, there are very few hints of red with both the action and navigation bar switching to the lighter color scheme. The only hint of color I noticed, so far, was a circular notification when there are new videos to watch in the Subscriptions tab. This redesign gets rid of the dedicated FAB used to upload videos and moves it to the action bar. To its right is a search icon, as well as your new profile page. Interestingly, that page slides up as a separate panel from the bottom of the screen. The Home, Trending, Subscriptions, and Shared sections remain completely identical to the existing app, but there is a new Library tab that features quick links to history, watch later, and all your playlists. Unlike with tabs, you can no longer swipe between the different sections of the app. Picture-in-Picture remains the same, as does scrolling through the various feeds of videos. It looks slightly weird how the PiP rests just above the bottom bar. It’s not clear when this design will rollout to all users.   Abner Li @technacity Is interested in the minutiae of Google and Alphabet.

The setting creates an ideal night-time experience by turning the glaringly light surfaces of YouTube’s interface dark—and you can activate it with a few simple steps, too! This tutorial details enabling and using YouTube’s Dark Mode in Chrome, Safari and other browsers, even if you currently don’t have the Material Design overhaul. Before we get to it, make sure that you’re running Chrome 57 or later. To check the version number of your copy of Chrome, choose About Google Chrome from the browser’s Chrome menu. How to enable Dark Mode on YouTube if you have Material Design If you already have YouTube’s Material Design, you can turn on Dark Mode right from the drop-down menu that appears when you click your profile image on YouTube. Dark Mode is a click away if you have YouTube’s Material Design. See our tutorial to learn how to enable YouTube’s Material Design (it’s rolling out gradually), which lets you toggle Dark Mode from your profile menu in Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Opera and other browsers. Cannot get Material Design? Follow the steps below to turn Dark Mode on in Google Chrome 57 or later (hat tip goes to a resourceful Redditor who first detailed this trick). How to enable YouTube’s Dark Mode if you lack Material Design For that, you’ll need to use the Chrome browser until Dark Mode and Material Design have been officially rolled out to all users of YouTube on desktop. 1) Launch Chrome on your computer and be sure to log in with your account via YouTube’s Worldwide (US) interface at www.youtube.com/?gl=US. 2) Open Chrome’s developer tools: Mac: Press Command (⌘)—Option (⌥)—I on the keyboard. Windows: Press either F12 or Control—Shift—I on the keyboard. 3) Click the Console tab near the top of the developer tools window. 4) Paste the following line into the console, then hit Enter: document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE; path=/" If that doesn’t work, try the following: text: document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE" HINT: Paste the command exactly as you see it. Some publications incorrectly used curly quotes in place of single/normal ones, rendering the command useless. 5) Close the developer tools and reload the YouTube webpage. 6) Click your profile image in the top-right corner of the interface, select a Dark Mode item, then toggle the switch Activate Dark Mode at the bottom of the menu. Kill all the lights and watch your favorite YouTube clips in night-time mode! Dark Mode is available across all YouTube sections, including the homepage and the dedicated channel pages, sans Creator Studio which continues to use the white theme. To kill Dark Mode, just toggle that switch in your YouTube profile menu to the OFF position (if that doesn’t work, clear the cookies in your browser settings). The command for activating Dark Mode without Material Design works in Firefox, too, but keep in mind that Mozilla recommends against changing the root path attribute as that leaves you open to hijacking attacks. TIP: Download the Chrome extension “Magic Actions for YouTube” on Chrome Web Store which adds a handy switch for toggling day and night viewing modes. Another Chrome extension, “Dark Reader”, also creates a night-time environment on YouTube. To reiterate: if you have Material Design, you should be able to toggle YouTube’s Dark Mode in Chrome, as well as in Safari, Firefox and other non-Google browsers. As you’re seeing above, I was able to select Dark Mode in Safari from my profile menu on YouTube without resorting to any trickery, and it worked like a charm. Have you tried YouTube’s night-time mode yet? If so, do you use it for watching videos at night?

Born three years ago, with roots in a failed video game, the messaging software is now used by five million people. The company behind it, Slack Technologies, found success by combining something that Silicon Valley fetishizes — rich data on how people use a product — with something it often overlooks: How do people actually feel while using it? This combination produced an unlikely hit that, when it became available in 2014, grew mostly by word of mouth, which is unusual for corporate software. Last year, the privately held company was valued at nearly $4 billion (all figures US). Now Slack faces a significant new challenge. It has become big enough to draw a competitive response from giants like Microsoft, but not big enough to have the roster of large corporate clients that it needs to compete with the giants. Last fall, Microsoft announced a direct Slack rival called Teams, to be given free to all 85 million users of its Office 365. At the same time, Facebook made its work collaboration tool, Workplace, widely available free. Atlassian, a smaller company, has signed big customers, too. As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology's largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams. Microsoft already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls. There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But chief executive Stewart Butterfield said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Apple's beating IBM in personal computing, Google's beating Microsoft in search and Facebook's crushing Google in social networks.           Slack is the product of Butterfield's second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, Game Neverending, had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005. In 2011, he introduced another game, Glitch, in which people co-operated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack. Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has five million daily users, up from four million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable. Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome video conferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in "channels," typically organized around a few well-defined tasks. "The overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue" with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 1,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities. Collaboration software like Slack is not new. Google's Wave, which started in 2009 and shut down in 2012, was supposed to replace email with a messaging tool, but conversations were too hard to follow and track. Atlassian, an Australian software company, released a team collaboration platform in 2004 and acquired Slack's nearest startup rival, HipChat, in 2012. But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify.   Slack modelled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called "raccooning," it signifies, "Please take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic." In Slack's office in Vancouver, designers think about things like colour choice, layout and Slack's sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer's peace of mind. Back at San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behaviour. "Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software," Slack wrote in an open letter to Microsoft that ran as a full-page ad in November in The New York Times.                             The battle between Slack and its rivals is essentially over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google. Slack wants to be in that pantheon — as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world's virtual conference room and water cooler. Slack's name — an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge — underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors. "Companies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship," said Sean Ryan, head of partnerships at Facebook's Workplace. "The No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated." "We're trying to build empathy at scale," Butterfield said. Slack's office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like "set out the towels" as they create new user features.   Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users' well-being. "There are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer," Butterfield said. "You really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we'll lose them."

At the same time, Facebook made its work collaboration tool, Workplace, widely available for free. Atlassian, a smaller company, has signed big customers, too. As a result, Slack, which built up momentum as a lovable underdog, must fend off some of technology’s largest and fiercest competitors if it wants to be more than a niche tool for small businesses and teams. Microsoft already offers ways for employees to collaborate. And while its offerings have not been viral hits, they have offered boring but important features that big companies demand, like strong data security and regulatory compliance controls. There is no illusion within Slack that success is certain. But Stewart Butterfield, the chief executive, said small tech companies with new ideas had long defeated larger rivals that tried to copy them. Think of Google beating Microsoft in search and Facebook crushing Google in social networks. One advantage Slack has is focus, Butterfield maintains. Microsoft, for example, has Slack-like products including Yammer, SharePoint, Skype for Business and now Teams. The executives who run those businesses within Microsoft must “compete for budget and mind share and attention,” he said, providing an opening for Slack to gain users while Microsoft managers wage internal wars. Microsoft said users would embrace Teams because it had strong encryption and global support and worked seamlessly with software they already used, like Excel. “We think customers value coherence,” said Bryan Goode, general manager of Office 365 at Microsoft. Slack is the product of Butterfield’s second failed attempt to make a video game. His first, “Game Neverending,” had a photo-sharing feature that became more popular than the game. It became Flickr, which was sold to Yahoo for $25 million in 2005. In 2011, he introduced another game, “Glitch,” in which people cooperated to build a shared world. (Misbehaving players got a timeout.) At its height, the game was costing the company $500,000 a month and bringing in $30,000, so Butterfield shuttered it in late 2012. A few employees stayed on to build out the messaging platform that Glitch engineers had used to talk among themselves. That project became Slack. Slack was officially introduced in February 2014 and today has 5 million daily users, up from 4 million in October. Most users are on a free version, but about 1.5 million pay Slack $6.50 to $12.50 a month for features like message storage and search. The 800-person company is on track to generate more than $200 million in revenue this year, but it is not profitable. Initially popular with small teams of software engineers who wanted to work remotely without cumbersome videoconferences or email, Slack was not designed for big companies. Users chat in “channels,” typically organized around a few well-defined tasks. “The overhead of working among different offices becomes less of an issue” with Slack, said Nick Coronges, chief technology officer at R/GA, a 1,000-person design and marketing agency with offices in several cities. Collaboration software like Slack is not new. Google’s Wave, which started in 2009 and shut down in 2012, was supposed to replace email with a messaging tool, but conversations were too hard to follow and track. Atlassian, an Australian software company, released a team collaboration platform in 2004 and acquired Slack’s nearest startup rival, HipChat, in 2012. But Slack has focused on making a product that people love, a strategy that is more common among consumer companies like Apple, Snap and Spotify. Slack modeled itself after consumer messaging apps that let users communicate with GIFs, stickers and emojis. One Slack emoji is a cartoon raccoon with its palms pressed in respectful greeting. Called “raccooning,” it signifies, “Please take this conversation someplace else. You are getting off topic.” In Slack’s office in Vancouver, British Columbia, designers think about things like color choice, layout and Slack’s sign-in greeting, and how they might affect a customer’s peace of mind. Back at the San Francisco headquarters, data jockeys pore over the kinds of signals that tech companies normally study, like time spent with the product and whether moving a button elicits a change in behavior. “Building a product that allows for significant improvements in how people communicate requires a degree of thoughtfulness and craftsmanship that is not common in the development of enterprise software,” Slack wrote in an open letter to Microsoft that ran as a full-page ad in November in the New York Times. Unlike some Silicon Valley companies, Slack believes humans are as important as robots. All executives, including Butterfield, have fielded the 6,000 customer support calls and 2,800 Twitter messages that come in each week. The average turnaround time for a help request is under an hour. “I get worried if I see customer satisfaction scores dip below 97 percent,” said Ali Rayl, Slack’s head of customer experience. If Slack can dovetail seamlessly with how people behave, feel like second nature to use and strongly appeal to employees, taking it away could become “like taking off your astronaut helmet in space,” Butterfield said. When it began, Slack had fewer features than its rivals had, but that wasn’t seen as a problem at first. Tens of thousands of small teams were creating accounts, some even paying, without much prompting. Smaller customers still account for more than half of Slack’s revenue. But Slack knew it would always be a niche product without basic features like “threading,” a standard email and chat room feature that groups together replies to a message, and an easier sign-in process. Originally each team required its own sign-in, even if an employee worked on many teams in the same organization. As competition heated up, Slack started to elicit feedback from companies like Capital One. The bank’s teams wanted to log in at one place and get access to all of their Slack rooms. They wanted each channel to allow more people, and they wanted to customize features, like file sharing, to comply with regulations. Slack made those changes, and employees “latched on,” said Jennifer Manry, vice president for workforce technology at Capital One, “an indication that it was filling a critical need.” At the end of January, Butterfield unveiled Enterprise Grid. Aimed at companies and governments, it can manage the conversations of up to 500,000 employees at once. IBM, Jet.com, NASA and Home Depot have all used the product. But Slack has not taken over. Capital One still uses collaboration tools from Microsoft and Atlassian. Facebook and smaller companies like Asana share customers with Slack, too. Microsoft Teams is available in 181 markets around the world in 19 languages. Slack is available only in English, wherever the app can be downloaded. The battle between Slack and its rivals is essentially over who will make the next piece of workplace software that no one can live without. Many businesses, large and small, depend on Excel from Microsoft, Photoshop from Adobe and Gmail from Google. Slack wants to be in that pantheon — as the place where people collaborate and hang out online, the world’s virtual conference room and water cooler. Slack’s name — an acronym for Searchable Log of All Conversation and Knowledge — underscores its big ambition. But to become a Microsoft-size success it needs workers to choose Slack over its competitors. “Companies want their employees to collaborate more, because better collaboration reduces the need to jump ship,” said Sean Ryan, head of partnerships at Facebook’s Workplace. “The No. 1 reason people leave their jobs is they feel isolated.” “We’re trying to build empathy at scale,” Butterfield said. Slack’s office walls are covered with customer feedback, and soothing French pop music is piped into the restrooms. Company engineers say being a good designer is like being a good host, and they use shorthand like “set out the towels” as they create new user features. “I’ve been building software for 15 years, and I’ve become more attuned to how the average person will interact with and experience software in the last 18 months here than in the prior 13 years,” said April Underwood, who joined Slack as vice president of product in 2015. Whether this approach translates into profits for Slack depends largely on how fast the company can expand into more countries and whether employees at big companies push their information technology departments to pay for it. That would necessitate an unusual level of devotion to a piece of workplace software, which is why Slack says it is so devoted to its users’ well-being. “There are people who will die, get divorced, have children with cancer,” Butterfield said. “You really have to put yourself in their frames of mind. If we preoccupy these people for a minute longer than we have to, we’ll lose them.” Katie Benner is a New York Times writer.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Network The Broadband Battle Is On in Kansas City, Mo. AT&T, Comcast, Consolidated Communications and Spectrum (formerly Time Warner) only sped up their service after Google Fiber came to town. They all insist it was customer demand, not Google, that prodded them. by Scott Canon, The Kansas City Star / April 17, 2017 Shutterstock (TNS) -- Time Warner Cable is dead. Long live Time Warner, er, Spectrum. Where not long ago Google Fiber was the new cool kid in Kansas City, bringing to town a high-tech cachet and the promise of broadband to burn, now it’s the focus of ridicule in a Spectrum ad campaign. “Abandoned by Google,” screams the headline in full-page newspaper ads running this month. “Kansas City residents have Fiber accounts canceled.” RELATEDPortland's Google Fiber Launch DelayedGoogle Fiber Delays San Jose RolloutGoogle Pulls Plans for Fiber Expansion We’ve got a cable war in Kansas City. The stakes only figure to go up. The old Time Warner Cable was long loathed by customers as a semi-monopoly that charged too much, broke down too often and delivered internet that was too damn slow. Now, swallowed by fellow cable giant Charter, it offers a friendly face under the new Spectrum brand and paints Google as the big guy who just doesn’t care. To some extent, Google Fiber had it coming. It took small deposits from customers who waited for years — often passing up discounts from the competition in the meantime — and then told them this spring that it wouldn’t hook them up to its speedy fiber-optic lines any time soon. Those customers (“too bad they couldn’t keep up with their end of the bargain,” one said this week on a Google forum) got a raw deal. But Spectrum only sped up its service after Google Fiber came to town. Ditto AT&T, Comcast and Consolidated Communications. They all insist it was customer demand, not Google, that prodded them. Whatever. Much has happened in the nearly five years since Google Fiber started selling service here. It’s all about the bundle. These telecoms and cable companies want to be your sole connection to digital content. They know that the company’s skim from selling packages of phone, internet and video is bigger than selling you just one of those things. AT&T bundles in cell service — particularly valuable because the company understands you’re less likely to switch to somebody else when everything’s conveniently combined and discounted in a single utility bill. Customer turnover is the bane of wireless carriers. Just ask Sprint. Comcast is getting into the cellphone business. Google’s Project Fi (although not bundled with Google Fiber) will sell it to you. Analysts assume that within a few years, any company peddling a cable subscription will offer cell service. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump signed legislation this month that killed privacy rules demanding your consent to collect and sell web browsing history and everything else that moves over your internet connection. That gives your cable company even greater data-mining power than outfits like Facebook and Google, companies that have made billions tracking us. The chance to wire your home or apartment has never looked more lucrative. The war is on. Your info-utility bill is the prize. ©2017 The Kansas City Star (Kansas City, Mo.)

The router system operates on a mesh network which allows you to maintain stronger connectivity across your house, increasing coverage even in dead spots. And now, an FCC filing from Google has been spotted (via) which appears to detail a new Google Wifi version that strangely seems to be lacking a particular feature Related: Best wi-fi extenders A different model number to the existing Google Wifi device tells us this is indeed an updated version of the system, and it seems the newer update will see Google do away with support for the ZigBee IoT protocol. Yes, the new version appears to be missing one of the wireless bands (the 2.405-2.475 GHz) that would previously have been used for the ZigBee support. ZigBee is an open wireless technology for smart home devices and has been competing with other similar technologiess to become the standard for all smart home products. It's controlled by the ZigBee Alliance, which is made up of Intel, Philips, Samsung, and Qualcomm, with Philips’ Hue smart bulbs using the wireless technology. And while it looks like Google has dropped support for ZigBee, the company has had a good relationship with the alliance in recent months, so it seems likely we'll see the standard integrated into another of Google's products. Google included ZigBee support in the OnHub and the current version of Google Wifi, but it's never actually turned the functionality on, so it's not a huge loss, and could possibly mean we'll see ZigBee support crop up on a future version of Google Home. At this point, there's no official word from the company on what it's plans are, so for now nothing's been confirmed. But it seems Google has some sort of plan which is likely to become clearer in the near future so stay tuned.

The complaint, originally filed a few years back by Russian search engine provider Yandex, accused Google of abusing its dominance in the marketplace by requiring that certain apps be pre-loaded on Android devices sold in Russia. Google also prohibited rival search engines and other applications from being installed on devices. As per the agreement, Google will halt the aforementioned requirements. Alexei Dotsenko, FAS deputy head, told Reuters that Google will also develop a tool that’ll allow users to select their own default search engine on Android devices. Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, said implementation of the settlement’s terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications, adding that they managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices. The FAS in 2016 handed down a 438 million rubles ($7.8 million) fine which Google is still required to pay. The fine equates to nine percent of Google’s revenue in Russia in 2014 (plus inflation). Google confirmed the agreement with Reuters, saying that it met the interests of all parties involved. Shares in Yandex are trading up more than seven percent on the New York Stock Exchange as of writing.

The deputy head of the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), Alexei Dotsenko, announced the news today, confirming the deal. While Google has reportedly said in response that the interests of both parties have been satisfied, further corroborating that a deal has indeed been reached. As part of the settlement, Google will not be able to insist on the exclusivity of its own apps on Android devices in Russia. In addition, Google will not be able to demand that other competing search engines and apps cannot be installed. Furthermore, the giant tech company must offer a tool that will enable users to select the default search engine of their own choice on Android-based smartphones and tablets. The Russian company Yandex, who is likely to be one of the big beneficiaries of this deal (as it often referred to as the ‘Google of Russia’), saw its Nasdaq-listed shares rise in early trading. Offering similar services to Google in Russia, Yandex has faced difficulties increasing its mobile search market share in the country. The long-standing disagreement began several years ago when the initial claims by Yandex surfaced, with Yandex claiming that the demand for pre-installation of Google’s own apps on Android-run devices was unfair. Stating that device manufacturers wanting to install the Google Play Store also had to pre-install other Google services, as well as setting Google as the default search engine. At the same time, the Russian multinational tech company complained that Google had blocked long-standing partners such as Explay, Fly, and Prestigion from installing Yandex software on their devices. Back in 2015, the FSA backed Yandex by agreeing that Google’s demands were an abuse of the company’s standing in the market. The earlier verdict was then upheld and in August last year, Google was handed a $7.8 million fine. The FAS says this fine still stands despite the new settlement being reached. According to the details, an agreed time period of six years and nine months applies to the settlement.

Since then, Google has updated its browser and made its own claims about prolonged battery life. However, it seems like Microsoft is not in the mood to ease up on its punches as the company has now claimed that the Windows 10 Creators Update has also brought along improved battery life to its browser, which puts it ahead of its competitors. As the Redmond-based company approached the matter last time around, it has again released a video of the comparison test between Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and Mozilla Firefox. In the video test, Microsoft says that three identical devices were made to run the same video but on different browsers. According to the results shared by the company, Mozilla Firefox ran out of juice first and provided a battery life of 7 hours 4 minutes. While Chrome managed to fare well in comparison with Firefox and gave a battery life of 9 hours and 17 minutes, it couldn't manage to catch up to Microsoft's Edge, which offered a battery life of 12 hours and 31 minutes in the comparison test.   The company further explained its methodology in a blog post, "According to our tests on the Windows 10 Creators Update - based on an open-source test which simulates typical browsing activities across multiple tabs - Microsoft Edge uses up to 31 percent less power than Google Chrome, and up to 44 percent less than Mozilla Firefox." Interestingly, the company has added that their tests are open, transparent, and reproducible. Microsoft says that it doesn't want to just show off the capabilities of its browsers but "also want to be a part of a constructive dialogue that improves the entire Web." The company has shared the methodology documents in order for the competition to check out their claims. Microsoft has definitely made a strong claim with its statement and we will have to wait and see how Chrome tackles these claims from the company going forward. As battery life is a huge concern for many users, this is definitely not a category where Google's browser would like to admit defeat.

Normangee Star Finance Market Industry Companies People Contacts About Our staff Contacts Terms of use Privacy Samsung Galaxy S8 won’t get Bixby Voice features from the day one 17.04.2017 Madeline Patrick 0 Comment It joins Apple’s Siri, Amazon’s Alexa, Google’s Google Assistant and Microsoft’s Cortana. For now, Bixby Voice will only be available at launch in Samsung’s home market of South Korea. Samsung said Bixby will focus on letting people control mobile apps with spoken directives. At the time of unveiling the Galaxy S8, Samsung promised that the full version of Bixby will be ready for prime time use when the device will go on sale. Those who have pre-ordered the Samsung Galaxy S8 ready for its worldwide launch on April 21st will be able to take advantage of Bixby’s augmented reality camera feature – dubbed Bixby Vision. Sriram Thodla, senior director of services and new business at Samsung, speaks about the new voice agent named “Bixby” that is featured on the new Samsung Galaxy S8 during a launch event, March 29, 2017, in New York City. This puts it a month at least past the Galaxy S8’s release, which will leave the phone without one of its main features, and little use for the dedicated hardware button on the side of the device. It even integrated a camera function which allows Bixby users to recognize prominent buildings, tourist destinations, and other famous places easily. Also coming at launch is the Bixby Home feed as well as Bixby Reminder. While there is no more the Samsung logo on the top of the phone, the fingerprint reader has been shifted to the back which doesn’t feel too bad because the S8 and S8 Plus makes it feels awkward because you have to reach for. The new smartphones have been proving a hit with Australians, with Samsung reporting they are selling more than the troubled predecessor Galaxy 7 by a rate of “double-digit percentage points”. When the company launched its new digital assistant, it included features like image recognition and location awareness. Set to hit United Kingdom stores on April 28, the Galaxy S8 will hit wannabe owners for a lofty £689. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus are backed up by a 3000mAh and 3500mAh battery respectively. A Samsung representative gave the details and it is stated that the digital assistant will be in the German language in the Q4 of this year. ← Tesla’s Elon Musk says company’s semi truck coming in September An idea to improve the US Supreme Court → Recent Posts President Erdogan hails win, opposition call for recount in Turkey referendum Police urge man who posted video of murder to turn self in EVENT CANCELLED: Underwater egg hunt set for Saturday Manhunt underway for Steve Stephens who livestreamed homicide in Cleveland Huge Alexis Sanchez Contract Could Put Arsenal ‘In Trouble’- Arsene Wenger Copyright © 2017 Normangee Star.

The resource is slated to be similar to LinkedIn, as it will serve as a professional environment in which job-seekers post their job history, while recruiters seek potential candidates on the site. However, Google Hire is already creating plenty of concern among people as the tool may be more thorough than some expect, unveiling the entire job history and all the companies a particular person worked for. The resource could result in entire, uncensored background checks with more information than many would like to offer up, including their YouTube history due to the fact that the YouTube channels you sign up to are all available to Google. Google Hire would mainly be a site to post ads for jobs, while also seeking potential candidates for those jobs. However, Google has not revealed much more than these elements of the tool. The resource is especially worrisome as we live in a time where less and less of our privacy seems to actually be private as many people have access to intricate details of our personal lives, including our browsing history. For now, Google Hire can only be accessed by those who have been explicitly invited by the company to join the professional recruitment tool and its services. GOOG stock is up 1.3% Monday, while GOOGL shares rose 1.4%.

The law of unintended consequences is once again rearing it’s ugly head: Google, Apple, Amazon and others now make virtual assitants that respond to commands, and recordings can trigger them. Burger King found out how, via a radio commercial, it could get Google’s attention. It produced an ad designed to trigger Google Home to advertise the Whopper. The ad featured a Burger King employee saying, “OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?” The Google Home device would then read the Wikipedia definition of a Whopper. The trigger stopped working a few hours after the ad launched. Then Burger King upped its game a bit, even after complaints from those living with a Google Assistant, and released an altered version of the ad to evade the block by Google. I turned to Slashdot, and discovered some readers were incredulous. How could Burger King DO SUCH A THING??  But there were a few more that saw opportunity. One wag said to use “Hey Google, deposit $20,000 into <routing number><checking account>. I want to try this with Siri, Amazon, and more.” Virtual assistants lack security controls Here are the facts: These audio servants can do many things for their users, but the stopgaps on them aren’t very good or even well-rehearsed. Could you DOX someone by playing subliminal orders for Papa John’s Pizzas on a pirate radio station that’s tuned in? What other fiendish commands will these accept without blushing?  How low of an audio level will the device accept audio input? Whisper level? Subliminally? What’s to say a mean MP3 doesn’t have something nasty embedded just below the threshhold of hearing? Who rates this stuff for its sensitivity? Can these devices pass some sort of Turing Test where a random number of faux requests are rejected?  + Also on Network World: TV news anchor triggers Alexa to attempt ordering dollhouses + Do we port this logic to automotive software so that a song playing on the radio that suddenly screams, “Siri, drive off that cliff” as its lyrics doesn’t cause a hard left turn to a fiery death? Is there going to be an “Are you sure?” followed by the song pausing, then screaming “YES!!!!” So, is the result, suicide by MP3? I ponder this. In my personal opinion, those deploying virtual assistants are asking for a lot of trouble. Not only do recordings become the crux of litigation, but the safety and security guards are all but missing. There is no regimen, no test, no standard among devices where they react in identical ways. Some users are leading the pack, trying to either get subpoenas or reject subpoenas about conversations that were ostensibly overheard by an audio robot. Will purchasing records or other searches become the context of insurance company litigation? Time will tell. Until then, I cannot believe that these open audio gateways aren’t becoming the crux of immense amounts of big data-style analytics.  Siri, Alexa, Cortana, Google Assistant know everything Piles upon piles of keywords. Siri can know the shows users are watching, the songs they’re playing, who they’re calling, and perhaps also the content of text messages, MMS, even the fact that certain photos were uploaded and attached to messages, and so forth. Google makes no pretense about the fact that non-commercial users of gmail have the entire contents of their messages scanned, ostensibly to help Google Ad Words. It’s an empire of data collection. And while everyone proudly states they won’t sell data to third parties, I personally have a tough time believing they haven’t already succumbed to bending their use to stretch it to the very edge of that meaning, and perhaps beyond. Who’s going to audit this? Who’s going to step up and say: We audited their vast storage piles and found that nothing could be touched. Do they ever wear this on their sleeves—hey, we survived an audit because we want you to trust us! Yeah. Point me to that URL. We’re only at the leading edge of digital assistant hacks.

File System Restrictions Sandboxing enforces file system write and read restrictions for XUL based add-on content (frame and process) scripts.

Windows Platform Specifics Windows Source Code Overview The core of the Windows sandbox is Google's chromium sandbox. Relative to the root of mozilla-central, the sandbox exists at: security/sandbox The chromium sandbox is based on the chromium base libraries (Google's code) which are located at: security/sandbox/chromium/base There is also partial/shim code to get the base code compiling with our SDK build settings or to limit the base code by reducing dependencies at: security/sandbox/chromium-shim/base The chromium Windows sandbox itself (Google's code) is located at: security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win Processes Overview There are 2 processes when dealing with a sandboxed application: The broker: The parent process that starts sandboxed children The target: The child process that is sandboxed Both processes make use of the chromium sandbox library, but they make use of it indirectly through 2 libraries (Mozilla code). This indirect use of the library is due to header conflicts with the ipc layer where it has a different, much older, non compatible, copy of the chromium base library (bug 925471): For the broker, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker For the target, ./security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxtarget Key source code locations The sandboxed target process lowers its own privileges after initialization via these calls: Content process GMP process NPAPI process Level descriptions header: http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/chromium/sandbox/win/src/security_level.h The call that starts the sandboxed process in Firefox is: https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/rev/918df3a0bc1c/ipc/glue/GeckoChildProcessHost.cpp#1030 All of the code that sets policies can be found here: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/security/sandbox/win/src/sandboxbroker/sandboxBroker.cpp OSX The OSX sandbox is based on the TrustedBSD MAC Framework. It is undocumented and considered private by Apple. Mozilla OSX Sandbox Ruleset wiki page OSX Sandbox OSX sandbox policy language Linux Seccomp stands for secure computing mode. It's a simple sandboxing tool in the Linux kernel, available since Linux version 2.6.12. When enabling seccomp, the process enters a "secure mode" where a very small number of system calls are available (exit(), read(), write(), sigreturn()). Writing code to work in this environment is difficult; for example, dynamic memory allocation (using brk() or mmap(), either directly or to implement malloc()) is not possible. Seccomp-BPF is a more recent extension to seccomp, which allows filtering system calls with BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) programs. Most of our Linux user base have systems that support seccomp-bpf. These filters can be used to allow or deny an arbitrary set of system calls, as well as filter on system call arguments (numeric values only; pointer arguments can't be dereferenced). Additionally, instead of simply terminating the process, the filter can raise a signal, which allows the signal handler to simulate the effect of a disallowed system call (or simply gather more information on the failure for debugging purposes). Seccomp-bpf is available since Linux version 3.5 and is usable on the ARM architecture since Linux version 3.10. Several backports are available for earlier kernel versions. For limitations that apply to the semantics of system calls (e.g., “can this process access the filesystem”, not “can this process use system call #83”) we require unprivileged user namespaces, which a large majority of desktop users don't support. Specifically: chroot()ing into a deleted directory to revoke FS access, and namespace unsharing for networking, SysV IPC if possible, and process IDs. seccomp-bpf filtering rules for various processes Bug Lists Windows Content Process sbwc1 low integrity sandbox support Roll out level 1 sandbox policy to release.

But privilege escalation via kernel vulnerabilities is relatively common, so we also use the seccomp-bpf system call filter to reduce the attack surface that a compromised content process can directly access.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 294 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares508 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Google Earth is a virtual globe that allows users to trawl satellite images of the planet's surface. It uses image resolutions that range between 15m to 15cm. One can search any area on the earth through Google Earth. It is assumed that the new version of Google Earth would replace its Google Maps app. A dramatically revamped version of Google Earth could bring in more functionality from Google Maps, including traffic reports and local listings. In coordination with commercial cargo provider Orbital ATK and launch service major United Launch Alliance (ULA), Nasa is set to broadcast the world's first live 360-degree stream of a rocket launch on 18 April. The live 360-degree stream of the cargo resupply mission lift-off to the International Space Station may be viewed on the Nasa Television YouTube channel starting 10 minutes prior to lift off, the US space agency said. Orbital ATK's Cygnus spacecraft will launch on a ULA Atlas V rocket carrying more than 3,447 kg of science research, crew supplies and hardware to the orbiting laboratory. Tata Consultancy Services is to announce its quarterly numbers for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, on Tuesday. The company reported a 10.9 per cent growth in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, growing to ₹6,778 crore from ₹6,110 crore in the same period last year due to rapid growth in digital revenues. Movable and immovable properties of eight defunct emu companies in the district are to be auctioned by the Erode Revenue Officer on April 18, under directions of TNPID (Tamil Nadu Protection of Interests of Depositors) Court, Coimbatore. Auction of land, two and four-wheelers and office furniture of the following companies will be carried out at 3 p.m.: Greenlife Farms and Poultry, Queen Emu Farms Private Ltd, Suvi Emu Farms (India) Pvt Ltd, Susi Emu Farms India Pvt Ltd, and Sakthi Emu Farms based in Perundurai; Queen Emu Farms, Coimbatore; N.S.Agro Farm and Hatchery, Gobichettipalayam; and Ram Country Chicks, Kavindapadi. A release said that earnest money deposit had to be made by prospective bidders through demand draft of Rs. 25,000 each for land and four-wheelers and Rs 10,000 each for two-wheelers and office furniture, taken in a nationalised bank in the name of ‘Competent Authority and District Revenue Officer, Erode’. BJP’s Tamil Nadu unit is to stage state-wide protests outside retail liquor outlets in the state on April 18. The party’s state President Tamilisai Sounderrajan said the protest would be “apolitical” and involve like-minded people who are against liquor, including common citizens. Protests have erupted in various parts of Tamil Nadu over relocation of liquor shops that were closed following a Supreme Court order banning their presence within 500 metres from a highway. People, especially women, and anti-liquor activists have been protesting against relocation of such shops.

After all, you’re probably not going to pay tens or hundreds of thousands over asking if you think prices are going to pop anytime soon. So it’s worth noting that Canada has seen a massive spike in people searching for “housing bubble” on Google. Here is Google Trends’ chart of searches for “Toronto housing bubble” going back 13 years. Notice anything different lately? That spike probably has everything to do with the news coming out of Toronto’s housing market lately. The average house price in the metro area jumped 33 per cent in the past year, and in March it sat at $1.21 million for a detached home and $518,879 for a condo. Data like that prompted Bank of Montreal’s chief economist, Doug Porter, to declare it’s time to “stop with the pretense” and admit Toronto has a housing bubble. Google search history shows it’s when things get this feverish in the market that some people begin to lose faith. Here’s the chart for “housing bubble” searches in the U.S. going back to 2004. There is a sudden spike in the first half of 2005, as price growth reached a fever pitch. By 2007-2008, prices were falling rapidly in most major U.S. markets, and interest in the search term was waning. In other words, U.S. house prices tracked Google searches for “housing bubble” through the peak and decline of the bubble. Of course, there is more to a housing market than what people are Googling. There are mortgage rates, the employment situation and wage growth, not to mention — these days — foreign buyers and speculators. But other signs are also pointing to the possibility that the big bubble is headed for a pop. Like in the U.S. before its bubble burst, the economy's dependence on housing construction has reached an all-time high; household debt has hit an all-time high; the number of housing markets seeing rapid price growth has hit an all-time high; the quality of mortgages being issued is on the decline; and at least one major private mortgage lender is in trouble over its lending practices. That’s not to say Canada is destined to fall off the same economic cliff as the U.S. did a decade ago. But if you’re about to put a massive offer on a house you can barely afford, you may want to think twice — and search for “housing bubble” in Google. Follow The Huffington Post Canada on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Also on HuffPost: Close  What Toronto's Average House Price Will Buy You Around The World of   Located on a lush, narrow street that looks like a Caribbean jungle, this four-bedroom, three-bath house in ritzy Coconut Grove proves the average Toronto homeowner could live like a monarch in south Florida. The listing asks US$1.2 million (C$1.61 million). This seven-bedroom, seven-bath behemoth is located in Naperville, the U.S. Midwest’s richest municipality, about a 40-minute drive from downtown Chicago. For Toronto money, you can live like a Chicago one-percenter. The listing asks US$1.15 million (C$1.54 million). This five-bedroom, four-bath house in Provence comes with a separate caretaker’s home that includes three apartments, as well as a separate warehouse. But forget all that, look at the view. The listing asks 1.1 million euro (C$1.56 million). This terraced house, as it’s known in England, is located on an elegant street in the lively and ethnically diverse Brixton area of south London. Want to be north of the Thames? It’ll cost ya. But this place is within walking distance of two tube stations, so at 950,000 pounds (C$1.57 million), it’s nothing short of a London bargain. This house is located in one of Asia’s top vacation destinations, has views of lush rolling hills and the ocean, and offers nearly 3,800 sq. ft. of living space. Not a bad trade-in for a retired Torontonian. The listing asks 45 million Thai baht (C$1.74 million). OK, so there are still places in the world where housing is more expensive than Toronto. Central Paris is one of them, and here the average Toronto house price will get you a one-bedroom apartment. Granted, this place is in a completely renovated 18th-century building next to the Place de Furstenberg. The listing asks one million euro (C$1.42 million). Manhattan is another place that is still more expensive than Toronto (though the same cannot be said for New York as a whole anymore), but here the average Toronto house price will at least get you into a really good location. This apartment on Central Park South is steps from Columbus Circle and is walking distance to Times Square. The listing asks US$1.25 million (C$1.67 million). The world’s least affordable housing market will not get you much for your Toronto dollars. For the equivalent of around C$1.5 million, you can get apartment in the 350 sq. ft. to 500 sq. ft. range. So yes, things could be worse than they are in Toronto. Let’s just hope Toronto’s housing bubble never reaches Hong Kong proportions.  Share  Tweet  ✖ Advertisement Share this ✖ close Current Slide More: Housing bubble business video housing bubble canada housing bubble toronto toronto housing bubble canada housing bubble Real Estate housing canada toronto house prices House Prices video Suggest a correction   Click here to view Conversations Conversations Suggested For You FOLLOW HUFFPOST Email Email Address Please check the checkbox to indicate your consent Options HuffPost Daily Brief Business Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Make Sure Google Has Your Correct Work and Home Address By Eric Ravenscraft on April 17th, 2017 For years, Google has used your home or work address to tell you how long your commute will be, find restaurants nearby, and show you local weather. Usually, you shouldn’t have to tweak this but if you move, or if Google guesses your address incorrectly, you can change it. Here’s how. Google remembers two key addresses for you: home and work. If you’ve never set these, Google will try to guess the locations based on where you go and how often you’re there (if you have given Google permission to track your location, of course). These two addresses are shared across all Google products tied to your account, so if you change it once in one product, it should update anywhere. We’ll cover a few ways to change your address, but you can use whichever one is most convenient for you. RELATED ARTICLE How to Set Up Google Home Also, if you own a Google Home, there’s a third “device address” that you may want to set if your Google Home is not at your regular home address. Skip to the end of the article for more on that. Update Your Address With Google Assistant If you have an Android phone running 6.0 or higher, you can update your addresses with Google Assistant. First, open Assistant by long-pressing your phone’s home button. Then tap the menu button in the top-right corner and choose Settings.   Scroll down and tap “Personal info.” At the top of the screen, tap “Home &  work locations.” Here, you’ll see your home and work addresses. Tap the one you want to correct. As you type in your address, Google will provide suggestions that match addresses from Google Maps. Choose your address from the suggestions and tap “OK.” Once you’re done with one address, repeat the last couple steps to change the other one if you need to. Open Google Maps to Change Your Addresses On the Web If you don’t have an Android phone—or if it’s easier to change your address at a computer—you can do so in Google Maps. First, head to Google Maps on the web, and click the menu icon in the top-left corner. In the left-hand menu that appears, click “Your places.” You’ll see an entry for Home and Work. If you haven’t entered an address, click on either one to fill it in. If you have entered an address and want to change it, click the gray X icon to the right to clear the address, then set a new one. You can also search for “home” or “work” in Google Maps to find your saved addresses. Edit Your Home, Work, and Device Address With Google Home As we mentioned earlier, Google Home has its own special third type of address called “device address.” If you have a Google Home but it’s not at your home address, you can set the device address separately. You can also use the Google Home app to change your address the same way you do on Android. First, open the Google Home app and tap the menu icon in the top left corner. Then, tap “More settings.”   Scroll down and you’ll see an item in the list named “Device address.” Use this to set a separate address for your Google Home. This address will then be used when looking up information about places nearby, local weather, and anything else for which Google Home might need your address. Scroll a little further down and you can tap on “Personal info” to change your home and work addresses. This takes you to the same place we showed you in the Android section above. To change your Google Home’s address, tap “Device address.” Once again, Google will give you suggestions as you enter your address. Pick the closest match from the list and tap OK. If you ever need to change your Google Home’s device address, you’ll need to do it here. If you need to change your home or work address, however, you can do it in any of the many, many places Google allows you to change them.

The team, Facebook Artificial Intelligence Research — known internally as FAIR — is focused on a singular goal: to create computers with intelligence on par with humans. While still far from its finish line, the group is making the sort of progress few believed possible at the turn of the decade. Its AI programs are drawing pictures almost indistinguishable from those by human artists and taking quizzes on subject matter culled from Wikipedia. They’re playing advanced video games like Starcraft. Slowly, they’re getting smarter. And someday, they could change Facebook from something that facilitates interaction between friends into something that could be your friend. For these reasons and others, FAIR isn’t your typical Facebook team. Its members do not work directly on the $410 billion company’s collection of mega popular products: Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Facebook proper. Its ultimate goal is likely decades off, and may never be reached. And it’s led not by your typical polished Silicon Valley overachiever but by Yann LeCun, a 56-year-old academic who’s experienced real failure in his life and managed to come back. His once-rejected theories about artificial intelligence are today considered world-class, and his vindication is Facebook’s bounty. “Your interaction with the digital world, your phone, your computer, is going to be transformed,” LeCun told BuzzFeed News of what may be. FAIR is improving computers’ ability to see, hear, and communicate on their own, and its findings now permeate Facebook’s products, touching everything from the News Feed ranking to cameras and photo filters. And Facebook is investing, big time — not simply because artificial intelligence is interesting, but because it’s necessary. In all corners of tech today, companies are competing on the basis of their AI. Uber’s AI-powered autonomous cars are core to its ride-hailing strategy. Google’s AI-reliant Google Home smart speaker is answering queries users once typed in the search bar (and, long before that, looked up in the encyclopedia). Amazon is building convenience stores with artificially intelligent cashiers in an effort to crack the $674 billion edible grocery market. And at Facebook, AI is everywhere. Its AI-powered photo filters, for instance, are helping it fend off a challenge from Snapchat. Its AI’s ability to look at pictures, see what’s inside them, and decide what to show you in its feeds is helping the company provide a compelling experience that keeps you coming back. And similar technology is monitoring harassing, terroristic, and pornographic content and flagging it for removal. “The experiences people have on the whole family of Facebook products depend critically on AI,” said Joaquin Candela, the head of Facebook’s Applied Machine Learning group, or AML, which puts research into action on the platform itself. “Today, Facebook could not exist without AI. Period.” As the field becomes more advanced, Facebook will rely on LeCun and his team to help it stay ahead of competitors, new or current, who are likely to embrace the science. After years of criticism and marginalization, LeCun finally has it all: 80 researchers, the backing of Facebook’s vast financial resources, and mainstream faith in his work. All he has to do now is deliver.

Sight From an early age, LeCun believed he could get computers to see. Facial recognition and image detection may be standard today, but when LeCun was a university student in Paris in the early 1980s, computers were effectively blind, unable to make sense of anything within images or to figure out what was appearing inside their cameras’ lenses. It was in college that LeCun came across an approach to the field that had remained largely unexplored since the 1960s, but that he thought could potentially “allow machines to learn many tasks, including perception.” The approach, called an artificial neural network, takes systems of small, interconnected sensors and has them break down content like images into tiny parts, then identify patterns and decide what they're seeing based on their collective inputs. After reading the arguments against neural nets — namely that they were hard to train and not particularly powerful— LeCun decided to press ahead anyway, pursuing a PhD where he’d focus on them despite the doubts. “I just didn't believe it,” he said of the criticism. Hard times in the artificial intelligence field occur with such frequency and intensity that they have their own special name: AI Winter. These periods come about largely when researchers’ results don’t live up to their boasts, making it seem like the science doesn’t work, causing funding and interest to dry up as a result, and technological progress along with it. LeCun has seen his fair share of AI Winter. After settling into an AI research job at Bell Labs in the mid ‘90s, internal strife at AT&T caused his team there to come apart just as it was rolling out check-reading ATMs — neural-net-powered technology that’s still in use today — right as LeCun believed it was making clear progress. “The whole project was disbanded essentially on the day that it was becoming really successful,” LeCun said. “This was really depressing.” At the same time, other methods were gaining favor with mainstream researchers. These methods would later fall back out of favor, but their rise was enough to push neural nets — and LeCun, their longtime champion — to the margins of the field. In the early 2000s, other academics wouldn’t even allow him to present his papers at their conferences. “The computer-vision community basically rejected him,” Geoff Hinton, a neural net pioneer who’s currently an engineering fellow at Google and a professor at the University of Toronto, told BuzzFeed News. “The view was that he was carrying on doing things that had been promising in the ‘80s but he should have got over it by now,” Hinton explained. “That’s not the view anymore,” he added. View this post on Facebook facebook.com Other neural net researchers encountered similar problems at the time. Yoshua Bengio, a professor at the University of Montreal and head of Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms, had a hard time finding grad students willing to work with him. “I had to twist the arms of my students to work in this area because they were scared of not having a job when they would finish their PhD,” he told BuzzFeed News. In 2003, LeCun laid the foundation for his redemption. That year, he joined New York University’s faculty and also got together with Hinton and Bengio in a largely informal coalition to revive neural nets. “We started what I've been calling the Deep Learning Conspiracy,” LeCun said with a smile. “The computer vision community basically rejected him.” Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share The Deep Learning Conspiracy played a critical role in the field, mostly by virtue of sticking to its belief that of instead building individual, specialized neural nets for each type of object you wanted to detect, you could use the same template to build one neural that could detect image, video, and speech. So instead of building one neural net to detect penguins and another for cats, you could build a single neural net that could detect both, and tell the difference. These new neural nets could also be modified for other tasks, such as looking at audio waves to detect the patterns of speech. The Conspiracy’s research was buoyed by two important outside factors: Increases in computing power, which helped its neural nets work fast enough to be practical, and an exponential increase in available data (pictures, text, etc.) created thanks to the widespread adoption of the internet, which could be churned through the networks to make them smarter. The result eventually became a nimble, fast, accurate approach that opened up new possibilities for the field. With the fundamentals set in place by LeCun and his compatriots, computer vision exploded in the early 2010s. Computers began recognizing objects in images, then in videos, and then live in the camera. Now, you can point a camera at a basketball and AI can understand what it’s looking at. LeCun quickly went from guy on the sidelines to a leader in the field. “It went from nobody working on it to everybody working on it within a year,” LeCun said. “It's just insane — it's completely insane.” In December 2013, LeCun joined Facebook, an ideal environment for someone interested in applying AI research to photos. Facebook’s platform is packed with billions of images, giving LeCun and his researchers a big broad canvas to implement new ideas. FAIR regularly collaborates with AML, to put its research into action on Facebook proper. The two groups build new systems that make the advances available across the company. AML is using FAIR’s research to help determine what content is shown to you in the News Feed, to translate content inside Facebook; it's also deploying it inside Facebook’s camera to create special effects that react to your motion.

Thought Teaching computers to see is an elemental step toward teaching them how the world works. Humans understand how the world operates because we watch scenarios repeated over and over, and develop an understanding of how they’ll play out. When a car comes speeding down a road we’re standing in, for instance, we predict it might hit us, so we get out of the way. When it gets dark, we predict flipping a light switch will make it light again, so we flip it. FAIR is trying to teach computers to predict outcomes, just like humans do, using a similar method. The team, LeCun explained, is showing its AI lots of related videos, then pausing them at a certain point, and asking the machine to predict what happens next. If you repeatedly show an AI system videos of water bottles being turned over people's heads, for instance, it could potentially predict the action will get someone wet. “The essence of intelligence, to some extent, is the ability to predict,” LeCun explained. “If you can predict what's going to happen as a consequence of your actions then you can plan. You can plan a sequence of actions that will reach a particular goal.” Teaching artificial intelligence to predict is one of the most vexing challenges in the field today, largely because there are many situations in which multiple possible outcomes are theoretically correct. “The essence of intelligence, to some extent, is the ability to predict.” Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Imagine, LeCun said, holding a pen vertically above a table and letting go. If you ask a computer where the pen will be in one second, there is no correct answer — the machine knows the pen will fall, but it can’t know exactly where it will land. So you need to tell the system that there are multiple correct answers “and that what actually occurs is but one representative of a whole set of alternatives. That’s the problem of learning to predict under uncertainty.” Helping AI understand and embrace uncertainty is part of an AI discipline called “unsupervised learning,” currently the field’s cutting edge. When AI has observed enough to know how the world works and predict what’s going to happen next, it can start thinking a bit more like humans, gaining a kind of common sense, which, LeCun believes, is key to making machines more intelligent. LeCun and his researchers allow that it will most likely take years before AI will fully appreciate the gray areas, but they’re confident they’ll get it there. “It’ll happen,” said Larry Zitnick, a research manager who works under LeCun. “But I would say that’s more of the 10-year horizon-ish.” Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Facebook: zuck Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin A still from Zuckerberg's "Jarvis" video. Speech Back in December, Mark Zuckerberg published a splashy video demoing his “AI butler,” Jarvis. Coded by the Facebook founder himself, Jarvis made Zuckerberg toast, allowed his parents into his house after recognizing their faces, and even taught his baby daughter, Max, a lesson in Mandarin. Jarvis was cool. But to LeCun, it was nothing special. “It’s mostly scripted, and it’s relatively simple, and the intelligence is kind of shallow, in a way,” LeCun said. His sights are set higher. Jarvis was cool. But to LeCun, it was nothing special. Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share LeCun wants to build assistants, but ones that really understand what you tell them. "Machines that can hold a conversation,” he said. “Machines that can plan ahead. Machines you don't get annoyed at because they are stupid.” There’s no blueprint for that, but FAIR is working on what may be the building blocks. Giving AI a rudimentary understanding of the world and training it to predict what might happen within it is one component. So is teaching it to read and write, which FAIR is using neural nets for, too. To a computer, an image is an array of numbers — but a spoken sentence can also be represented as an array of numbers, as can text. Thus, people like LeCun can use neural networks architectures to identify the object in images, the words in spoken sentences, or the topics in text. AI still can’t comprehend words the way it comprehends images, but LeCun already has a vision for what the ultimate Jarvis might look like. His ideal assistant will possess common sense and an ability to communicate with other assistants. If you want to go to a concert with a friend, for instance, you’d tell your assistants to coordinate, and they would compare your musical tastes, calendars, and available acts to suggest something that works. “The machine has to come up with some sort of representation of the state of the world,” LeCun said, describing the challenge. “People can’t be in two places at the same time, people can’t go from New York to San Francisco in a certain number of hours, factor in the cost of traveling — there’s a lot of things you have to know to organize someone’s life.” Facebook is currently experimenting with a simple version of these digital assistant called M, being run by its Messenger team and relying on some FAIR research. Facebook Messenger recently released “M suggestions,” where M chimes into conversations in moments it thinks it can help. When someone asks “Where are you?” for instance, M can pop into the conversation and give you the option to share your location with a tap. It’s likely the company will expand this functionality into more advanced uses. M is one application of Facebook’s efforts use AI to understand meaning, but the company is considering other uses for the technology. It may even put it to work in an effort to break down barriers it was recently accused of helping put up. Even before the 2016 election drew attention to polarization and fake news on Facebook, Y-Lan Boureau, a member of LeCun’s team, was working to use AI to create more constructive conversations on Facebook. Boureau, who studied neurology as well as AI, decided to pursue this project after spending a summer watching her friends fight on Facebook with little interest in hearing opposing views. “If we could better understand what drives people in terms of their state of mind,” Boureau explained, “and how opinions are formed and how they get ossified and crystallized, and how you can end up with two people being unable to talk to each other, this would be a very good thing.” Boureau wants to create a world where we see as many opinions as we can handle — up until the point at which we start tuning them out. AI can help with this by mapping out patterns in text, understanding where something goes off the rails and potentially figure out a way to alter the conversation flow to stem the bad turn. “If we knew more about that learning process and how these beliefs get in people’s heads from the data then it might be easier to understand how to get more constructive conversations in general,” Boureau said. In the aftermath of the 2016 election, LeCun publicly suggested Facebook had the technical capabilities to use AI to filter out fake news. Some saw his statement as a solution to a problem many blamed for the widespread polarization in the US, but LeCun said that the task was best left to third parties, instead of machines capable of introducing bias. “There’s a role AI can play there, but it’s a very difficult product design issue rather than a technological issue,” he said. “You don’t want to lead people into particular opinions. You kind of want to be neutral in that respect.” Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Share On email Share On email Share On link Share On link Share This Link Courtesy Facebook Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Share On pinterest Pin Examples of FAIR's SharpMark. Reality Hype cycles can be dangerous for the AI field, as LeCun knows well. And today, it certainly seems like we’re in one. In the first quarter of 2013, six companies mentioned AI on earnings calls. In the first quarter of 2017, 244 did, according to Bloomberg. LeCun is careful to couch his statements when discussing the future. “This is still very far from where we want it to be,” he’ll say. “The stuff doesn't work nearly as well as we'd like it to,” he’ll caveat. Indeed, as LeCun cautions, AI is still far from reaching human level intelligence, or General AI as it's known. Hype cycles can be dangerous for the AI field, as LeCun knows well. Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Share On facebook Share On facebook Share Share On twitter Share On twitter Share Still, sometimes LeCun can’t restrain his enthusiasm. He’s particularly excited about adversarial training, a relatively new form of AI research that could help solve the prediction and uncertainty challenges facing the field today. Adversarial training pits two AI systems against each other in an attempt to get them to teach themselves about the real world. In one FAIR experiment, for instance, a researcher has one AI system draw pictures in an attempt to trick another into guessing they were drawn by humans. The first uses feedback from the second to learn to draw better. At a conference earlier this year, LeCun showed something even more advanced: One AI's attempt to convince a second AI that a few frames of a video it created part of a video the second AI had already viewed. Adversarial training, LeCun said, “is the best, coolest idea in machine learning in the last 10 or 20 years.” And so LeCun will keep playing around with adversarial training, once again pushing the field to its boundaries. He’s come a long way from the man who couldn’t even get his ideas heard 20 years ago. Though LeCun will be the first one to tell you the work is far from over, and that the success is far from his alone, he’s not one to let the moment pass without a small bit of appreciation. “I can't say it feels bad,” he said. “It feels great.”● Alex Kantrowitz is a senior technology reporter for BuzzFeed News and is based in San Francisco.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. Both USB-C ports will charge the computer. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user.

It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   2 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

It’s also causing problems for some Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, and Pixel XL users. The Android 7.1.2 Nougat update is out of beta and it’s rolling out to Nexus and Pixel users around the world. As expected, the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update brings more than just bug fixes and security patches. The latest version of Nougat also comes with some useful fingerprint gestures for the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P. That’s the good news. The bad news is that Android 7.1.2 Nougat problems are popping up for Pixel and Nexus users. The Android 7.1.2 Nougat update went through a pretty lengthy beta but problems have, unsurprisingly, slipped through the cracks. Today we want to take a look at the Android 7.1.2 Nougat problems plaguing owners of the Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, and Nexus Player. We’ll also take a brief look at some of the Android 7.1.2 problems impacting the Pixel, Pixel XL, and Pixel C. Our roundup covers the initial batch of Android 7.1.2 issues and it also provides some tips and remedies we think could come in handy if and when you do run into an issue with the brand new version of Android Nougat. Prepare for Android 7.1.2 Nougat Android 7.1.2 and it changes are certainly tempting, particularly for those of you dealing with Android Nougat problems. While you might be tempted to install the Android 7.1.2 update the second it arrives on your device, we recommend doing some prep work. It could go a long way toward preventing Android 7.1.2 issues. It’s impossible to predict how Android 7.1.2 Nougat will fare on your device. This is precisely why you should do some prep work before you install it. This way, you’ll be prepared if and when you do run into something. We recently put together a step-by-step guide that will take you through the pre-installation process we used. If you don’t have a lot of time to prepare you’ll want to make sure all of your important files/data are backed up before making the move to Android 7.1.2. Android 7.1.2 Problems Google’s Nexus forums (and Pixel forums) are filling up with complaints about the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update. @googlenexus @GoogleUK @Google @Android why no mention pls of Nexus6P battery drain in 7.1.2 change log? Really poor way to treat customers! — Pete (@PETEW68) April 4, 2017 Current battery life/ drain on #nexus6p on #android 7.1.2. clearly someone wants us to jump to pixel ugh. It's unbearable @googlenexus pic.twitter.com/dQXw6H0Ukl — Husain Alnaqi (@ExeNaqi) April 6, 2017 So Android 7.1.2 fixed my Pixels bluetooth issues but now it randomly reboots and turns on 'do not disturb'. Anyone else? — Rama or Ben? (@DigitalRama) April 6, 2017 Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P users are reporting boot loops, installation problems, issues with the fingerprint sensor, camera problems, various problems with Bluetooth, charging problems, problems typing, abnormal battery drain, and cellular data issues. Pixel users are running into similar problems. Pixel and Pixel XL owners are noticing battery drain, issues with Bluetooth with Wi-Fi, installation problems, problems with the microphone, various issues with sound, issues with Google Assistant, and issues with the fingerprint sensor. We expect the complaints to pickup as the OTA picks up speed and more people decide to make the jump from older versions of Android Nougat to Android 7.1.2. So far, most of these Android 7.1.2 issues appear to be isolated. Outside of the issues with the fingerprint sensor, we haven’t seen any reports of widespread bugs or issues though that could certainly change down the road. There’s no guarantee you’ll encounter one of these issues on your device but the potential for problems should motivate you to prepare your smartphone or tablet for your Android 7.1.2 Nougat update. Where to Find Android 7.1.2 Feedback As we push away from the Android 7.1.2 update’s release you’ll want to keep an eye on Android 7.1.2 feedback. This feedback will alert you to potential benefits of Android 7.1.2 and it’ll also make you aware of issues plaguing the operating system. Thankfully, we’re already seeing Android 7.1.2 Nougat users post feedback on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. We’ve also put together our impressions of the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update. They include a quick look at its performance. (Quick note: We aren’t seeing the fingerprint issues other Nexus 5X owners are seeing on Android 7.1.2.) We’re also seeing useful feedback emerge on Google’s Pixel Help Forums, Google’s Nexus Help forums, XDA-Developers, YouTube, and Android-centric forums like Android Central Forums. Short-term feedback is useful but you’ll also want to make sure you dig into long-term feedback from Android 7.1.2 users, especially if you’re using an older device like the Nexus 6P or Nexus 5X. How to Fix Nexus Android 7.1.2 Problems If you’ve run into trouble with Android 7.1.2 Nougat, don’t panic. There’s a good chance you’ll be able to fix your issue from the comfort of your computer chair or couch. We’ve put together a list of fixes for the most common Nexus Android Nougat issues. If you don’t know where to turn, it’s a great starting point. If you’re dealing with an Android 7.1.2 fingerprint issue on your Pixel or Nexus, try flashing the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update. It appears these fingerprint sensor issues are more prevalent on devices running the OTA version of Android 7.1.2. We’ve also put together another guide that will show you how to fix Nexus Android Nougat battery life problems. If your battery doesn’t return to normal after a couple of days with Android 7.1.2 on board, take a look there. If you can’t find what you’re looking, take a peek at Google’s official Nexus Help Forums or Google’s Pixel Help forums. You might also try XDA-Developers. We also recommend getting familiar with the downgrade process. Downgrading back to an older version of Android Nougat could help your device’s performance. If you’re unfamiliar with the downgrade process for Nexus devices, take a look at this guide courtesy of the Nexus Help Forums. What’s Next If you’re in need of a fix you can’t rely on Google. Google hasn’t confirmed Android 7.1.3 or Android 7.2 so there’s a chance Android 7.1.2 will serve as the last version of Nougat. The company will continue to roll out its monthly security updates to Nexus and Pixel devices but there’s no guarantee those will help your performance. Google’s also confirmed Android O, its next mobile operating system, with a beta release. The Android O beta is currently limited to a few Nexus and Pixel devices. The company will almost certainly outline the Android O update at Google I/O in late May but don’t expect a final version of the software to arrive next month. That’s almost certainly being saved for later this year. If you run into an Nexus or Pixel Android 7.1.2 problem you’re probably on your own for a few more weeks. At least. 9 Things to Do Before Installing the Nexus Android 7.1.2 Update Get Familiar with Android 7.1.2 Nougat   1 / 9 One of the first things you'll want to do before installing Android 7.1.2 Nougat is to get familiar with the update. Blindly installing Android 7.1.2 Nougat on your device is a bad idea, particularly for novice Android users. If you haven't been following the Developer Preview, now would be a great time to get acquainted with Android 7.1.2 and its various changes. Some are big and obvious. Others are much smaller and harder to locate.  We've put together a guide that will walk you through Android 7.1.2 Nougat versus Android Nougat and Android Marshmallow. You can also get a feel for the changes here in this Android 7.1.2 Nougat release roundup. It's in your benefit to dig into the update prior to installing it. This way, you won't be caught off guard by any of the changes.    1 / 9 Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

The settlement puts an end to a two-year dispute brought by Russian search engine Yandex to break Google’s hold on pre-installed apps and search engines that are allowed to operate on Android handsets and tablets. Read: Android Antitrust: Google’s Big Problem In Europe Could Result In $7.5B Fine Yandex’s complaint was taken up by Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), which "issued a prescription to Google in order to require the company to remove anti-competitive restrictions from its agreements with manufacturers." In practice, that prescription will prevent Google from restricting third-party companies from pre-installing apps on Android devices. It also will deter Google giving its own services “preferential treatment” by littering the home screen with its own apps. Finally, the agreement will get rid of Google’s monopoly as the default search engine on the device. To achieve this newfound openness on the Android platform, Google will develop a “choice window” for its Chrome browser that will provide users in Russia the ability to change the default search engine. The company will also develop a new search widget that will allow users to perform searches on the device outside the browser while still using third-party search engines. In addition to the changes, which Google will have 60 days to implement after the agreement is finalized, the company will also have to pony up $7.85 million in fines for violating Russian antitrust laws. Read: Donald Trump Spam: Google Wins Case Against Pro-Trump Russian Spam Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh praised the agreement. “Under the terms of the settlement, 55 million Russian Android users will be offered a choice of search engines on their mobile devices,” he wrote in a blog post. Google still has a number of outstanding antitrust cases over its perceived monopoly on Android devices, including one brought against the company by the European Commission that could result in $7.5 billion in fines.

TP-Link Deco M5 router review: This mesh network comes with a side of... Video LiFi’s blazingly fast connectivity uses LEDs We only looked at the first iteration of Google Wifi, the company’s mesh networking set-up, a few months ago and already it looks like version two is in the works. A Google filing recently spotted at the FCC describes a new dual-band router, possibly an update to the company’s Google Wifi. Mentioned in this article Google Wifi  TechHive rating $125.99MSRP $129.00View on Amazon PDFs included with the filing mention a model number AC-1304—compared to the current model, which is NLS-1304-25. The most notable change, as first spotted by Android Police, is that this router apparently is not equipped with a ZigBee radio. Google filed an RF exposure evaluation report for a 2.4GHz wireless LAN, a 5.0GHz wireless LAN, and Bluetooth LE, but nothing for a ZigBee radio. Ian Paul/IDG The suspected Google Wifi label spotted at the FCC. ZigBee is an open, low-power wireless technology for smart home products. It’s controlled by the ZigBee Alliance, which includes Intel, Philips, Samsung, and Qualcomm as member companies. Philips’ Hue smart bulbs are one of the most popular ZigBee products. ZigBee has been chasing the dream of being the unifying IoT application layer for years but is only one of several standards vying for that title. Why this matters: Google and ZigBee have become increasingly cozy over the past few years, announcing at CES 2017 plans for the ZigBee Alliance to certify devices that use the Google-developed Thread protocol for networking. It wouldn’t make sense for Google to back away from ZigBee now. What might be happening instead is that Google is working to incorporate ZigBee into some other home networking product—perhaps a new Google Home that also functions as a smart home hub. But that is pure speculation on our part. To comment on this article and other TechHive content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

The bug has been fixed on Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer and Safari but it still affects the current Chrome browser, version 57.0.2987, and the current version of Firefox, 52.0.2. Read: Google Fact Check Helps Identify Fake News, Now Available In Search The exploit was reported to Chrome and Firefox Jan. 20 and was fixed in Google Chrome Canary on March 24. Google will include the fix in Chrome 58, which should be available to everyone by April 25, Zheng said. The bug exploits Punycode, which makes it possible to register domains with foreign characters. It converts an individual domain label to an alternative format using only ASCII characters (i.e. xn--s7y.co would be 短.co in Chinese browsers). With the flaw, phishers can register fake domains that look identical to a real website. For example, a safe proof-of-concept by Zheng seems to direct users to apple.com, but it’s actually www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com. Another proof of concept was demonstrated by Wordfence, which shows their epic.com domain was actually https://xn--e1awd7f.com/, however, it shows up in Chrome and Firefox as epic.com. Read: What Is Google AutoDraw? Web-Based Tool Can Turn Everyone Into A Designer Google posted an update about Chrome Monday, saying it regularly rolls out security updates for users although it did not specifically mention the bug. “Chrome automatically updates behind the scenes every six weeks to ensure that you always have the latest security features and fixes,” the company said in a statement. “And if we find an important security bug, we push out a fix within 24 hours — no update from you required.” On the other hand, Mozilla is undecided on whether to fix the bug. Wordfence recommends the following steps for Firefox users: In your Firefox location bar, type about:config. Do a search for punycode. You should see a parameter titled: network.IDN_show_punycode Change the value from false to true.

They had plenty of spirit and were pretty well organised in the main but I’m struggling to remember a Premier League side so one-dimensional – punt into the box, nod down, hope for the best: that was the plan. And on this occasion it wasn’t enough, for all Arsenal’s defensive frailties. Alexis Sanchez gives his shirt to a young fan after the game.

(Photo : Google/YouTube) Google Pixel 2 will launch in 2H 2017 and the specs have become the talk in town. Google's premium flagship is about to get major revamps as the screen will sport an OLED display, the optics will pack more pixels and the USB C port will reportedly be added in the phone. With Google reportedly signing a mega contract with LG display for OLED panel supply, it can be argued that the next Pixel phone will get a different display technology. The $880 strategic investment is a pretty impressive figure and that should give a strong hint to the fans, what kind of smartphone, the Google Pixel 2 will be. The Pixel phone is touted as the best camera phone. When the Google Pixel 2 comes out this year, the company will still make the optics as the hottest selling point. Google could be equipping the device with a better video recording ability and much revamped lens, The Quint reported.   With the iPhone 7 Plus sporting dual-lens camera, Google could consider the module for its upcoming Pixel 2. A few Pixel users claimed to have audio problem with their phones and it is plausible that Google will make a few tweaks to prevent the issue from happening to its successor. Additionally, Google could be switching to USB type C port as this is one of the golden rules in today's smartphone, Forbes reported. Another decent benefit to expect from Google Pixel 2 is the dust and water resistant chassis. It would be a great feature addition for the handset if it is IP68 certified. HTC might still supply the manpower for Google to manufacture the Pixel 2 and many fans hope that it will be a refined smartphone - more than just a successor. What is more important is that the rumored OLED display will make the Google Pixel 2 visually stunning. It will have a similar design to the current Samsung Galaxy S series. However, all of the specifications are to be taken with a grain of salt until the official revealing in August confirms everything.     Tags google pixel 2, google pixel 2 release date, Google Pixel 2 Specs, google pixel 2 oled display © 2017 University Herald, All rights reserved.

Newsletters Site Log In Advisor Insights Log In Microsoft to Release Google Chromebook Rival in May By Donna Fuscaldo | April 17, 2017 — 11:32 AM EDT Share Microsoft (MSFT) is gearing up to take on Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG) Google Chromebook, with reports surfacing that it will roll out a low-cost laptop in May. According to a report in Venture Beat, the new laptop is expected to do more than its Surface tablet but not have all the bells and whistles of its Surface Book, which is aimed at the corporate market. The laptop, which will run on Windows 10 Cloud instead of the Windows 10 operating system, will be able to support apps that are in the Windows Store and that is all. Targeting Education The aim is to create device that is simple and secure, geared toward the education market — the same strategy Google pursued with the Chromebook. Google had a home run with the Chromebook, which has found its way into schools around the country. (See also, Why Google Chromebooks Are a Hit in Schools.) Venture Beat noted the device’s rumored name is the CloudBook and that it is expected to launch next month at the company’s education-focused hardware and software event. At the same time, Google has been busy adding more features to its device. For instance, users can now run Android apps on Chromebooks, and there is far more choice now that convertible and detachable versions of the Chromebook have entered the marketplace. PC Market Struggles Microsoft’s move towards a cheap, bare-bones, cloud-based laptop comes at a time when the PC market around the globe is struggling. According to market research firm IDC, worldwide shipments of traditional PCs—desktops, notebooks and workstations—saw a slight uptick of just 0.6% during the first quarter, to 60.3 million units shipped, essentially flat from a year ago. This marks the first time since 2012 shipments actual rose in the first quarter. (See also, Worldwide PC Shipments Struggle in Q1.) PC shipments in the U.S. were hit particularly hard, with IDC reporting a slight decline compared to last year. Slumping sales of notebook PCs were to blame for the pain in the first quarter, said IDC. The business PC market was strong during the same three months, thanks largely to the growth of Google’s Chromebook shipments. Overall in the U.S., PC shipments during the first quarter came in at 13.3 million units.

Follow Lynsey Related City Talk IDA Ireland Talk Why cybersecurity needs more attention from business leaders Google and Russian authorities have settled a two-year dispute (Source: Getty) Lynsey Barber A long running battle between Google and Russian authorities over the Android operating system used on many popular smartphones has finally been settled. The two-year dispute has now been settled out of court after Russia's Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) concluded in 2015 that the tech giant abused its market dominance by forcing phone makers to have Google apps on their devices. Read more: Google will trump Amazon in the battle for your home The settlement included Google agreeing that it remove any restrictions in agreements with manufacturers in the country and must let third party applications, including search engines, appear. The Google search bar will be replaced with a Chrome widget and Russian search engines will be able to appear on the screen. That includes Yandex, the Russian internet firm and Google rival which first brought the complaint, which today welcomed the agreement as "an important day for Russian consumers". "Now millions of Russian Android users will be offered a choice of search engines on their mobile devices. I am thankful to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for applying the law in a manner that effectively and efficiently restores competition to the market for the benefit of Russian users, as competition always breeds innovation," said Yandex chief executive Arkady Volozh. The deal also includes a fine of 439m rouble (£6.2m) for Google, first handed down in late 2016. “Implementation of the settlement’s terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications," said FAS head Igor Artemiev. "We managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices. The settlement’s execution will have a positive effect on the market as a whole, while giving developers additional options for promoting their products,” he said. Read more: Google isn't innocent, but neither are advertisers Google faces a similar tussle with regulators in the EU, where competition chief Margrethe Vestager believes it broke competition rules. She last year claimed Google required other smartphone makers to pre-install its search and browser apps and that it also stopped them from selling devices running on competing operating systems and claims that they were handed "financial incentives" by Google to put only Google's search on devices. Google hit back at the charges, arguing it is the most "open, flexible, and differentiated of the mobile computing platforms".

Login Search Google reaches out-of-court deal with Russia in Android case April 17, 2017, 10:52:00 AM EDT By Reuters Reuters UPDATE 1-Google reaches out-of-court deal with Russia in Android case 
(Adds details of the deal, Google comment, Yandex share price)
    MOSCOW, April 17 (Reuters) - Russian anti-monopoly watchdog
FAS and Alphabet Inc's <GOOGL.O> Google have reached an
out-of-court settlement in a dispute over the tech giant's
Android operating system, FAS said on Monday.
    Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications
on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the
pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications,
Alexei Dotsenko, FAS deputy head, told reporters.
    As part of the agreement, Google will also develop a tool
allowing users to choose a default search engine on their
Android devices.
    FAS ruled in 2015 that Google was abusing its dominance by
requiring the pre-installation of certain applications on mobile
devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia'sYandex
<YNDX.O> which has struggled to grow its share of the mobile
search market.
    In August 2016, FAS imposed a 438 million rouble ($7.8
million) fine on Google which the company still has to pay after
reaching the settlement, FAS said.
    The deal was approved by a Russian court earlier on Monday,
Dotsenko said, adding that it was for a term of six years and
nine months.
    Google confirmed the deal, saying it met the interests of
all parties.
    Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up around 6 percent in
early trade on Monday.

⌂ Contact us Money Arts&Culture Tech Research Sports Global Media Medicine U.S. Google reaches out-of-court deal with Russian Federation over Android case April 17 19:30 2017 By Kerry Garner The case was brought to the FAS in 2015 by Yandex, which is Russia's dominant search engine and offers various apps including a popular one for ordering taxis. Google is to pay all fines imposed by FAS. FAS had accused Google of abusing its monopoly position in mobile app stores serving the Android operating system. In time, FAS imposed additional fines against Google, amounting to almost 1 million rubles in total. The news of the out-of-court settlement was first reported by Reuters, and its details are also available on FAS's website. Under the settlement, Google can not stop smartphone makers from pre-installing competing search engine apps on their devices. Russian search engine provider Yandex filed the original complaint against Google. For smartphones already sold to Russian residents, Google will develop a pop-up window in the Chrome browser that allows users to change their default browser, FAS said. In addition, the agreement states that Google will develop a new Chrome widget for Android devices already being used in Russian Federation, which will replace the standard Google search widget on the home screen and allow users to see the new "choice screen" when it's launched. According to the deputy head of FAS Alexey Dotsenko, a federal court has approved the settlement and a two-year-long court battle between the watchdog and Google has finally come to an end.

Name: Subject: Message: Google won’t require its apps to be pre-loaded on Android devices in Russia [Update] Newsby John Callaham12 hours ago 37 433 12 If you buy a new Android smartphone or tablet in Russia, you may not see any of Google’s standard apps or services on those devices out of the box any more. That’s because Google has reached a settlement with the Russian Federal Anti-Monopoly Service that states, in part, that Android devices sold in that country will no longer require that they have Google’s apps like Maps, Gmail and others to be pre-installed in order for those devices to gain access to the Google Play Store. See also: How to get a refund for apps purchased from the Google Play Store December 26, 2016 According to Reuters, the agreement also allows Android products in Russia the freedom to pre-install rivals to Google’s search engine. The company has also agreed to create a tool that will allow Android device owners to set up a default search engine. The settlement agreement is the end of a dispute between Google and Russia that began in February 2015. At that time, the Russian-based Yandex search engine sent a complaint to regulators claiming that Google’s requirement of pre-installing its search and other apps to gain access to the Play Store on Android was giving it an unfair advantage in the marketplace. Later that year, the government agreed with Yandex’s arguments, and in 2016 the FAS fined Google 468 million rubles ($6.75 million) for antitrust violations. Today’s settlement covers a period of six years and nine months, which means that Google cannot make Android device companies pre-install its apps until the end of 2023. This new development could cause other countries to launch their own antitrust investigations against Google. The European Commission has already started its own look into the company’s Android requirements. Google has already countered by saying the EC’s complaints do not consider competition between Android and Apple’s iOS. However, today’s decision in Russia could open the flood gates around the world and Google might have to make many similar settlements in the future. How this will affect the Android app ecosystem, and indeed the entire Android device market as a whole, is still an open question. Update: A Google spokesperson sent over word that today’s settlement agreement does not necessarily mean that all Android smartphones in Russia will not have Google apps pre-installed; hardware partners will still have the option to do so if they choose. It also sent over this more specific statement on the settlement: We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia’s competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android.

Read all about it below: Related articles Today's channel rundown - 17 April 2017 Today's channel rundown - 16 August 2016 Today's channel rundown - 15 September 2016 Today's channel rundown - 15 April 2016 Google's Russia deal Google has reached an agreement with the Russian authorities to open up its Android system to rival search engines in Russia, Reuters reports. The move comes after a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities, which, according to the report, saw the country's competition watchdog, FAS, in 2015 declare that Google was breaking the law when it mandated that applications, such as Google's search tool, had to be pre-installed on mobile devices that use Android. The agreed-upon deal will see Google ditch its application demands on Android-based devices in Russia, as well as remove any restrictions on the pre-installation of rival search engines, Reuters said. IoT's latest malware Internet of Things (IoT) devices running Linux are at risk of a new variant of malware, according to the latest research cited by security partner LIFARS. The solution provider said that BrickerBot operates like Mirai - a malware program that targets, enlists and groups IoT devices into botnets for sweeping DDoS attacks. LIFARS notes there is one noticeable difference between the two malwares, however, which is that BrickerBot engages in PDoS - permanent denial of service attacks, which, according to the cyber security specialist, are specifically targeted at Linux/BusyBox-based IoT devices that leave their Telnet port open and exposed to the internet. Cloudera's IPO Software vendor Cloudera is pegging its share price at $12 to $14 a share in an IPO of 15 million shares, according to Seeking Alpha. By this reckoning, the Apache Hadoop-based software player will be valued at $1.79 billion, based on 128M shares outstanding expected after the offering, Seeking Alpha's figures note. The vendor has previously been valued at $4.1 billion, when in 2014 Intel snapped up a chunk of the company for $30.92 a share. The chip vendor may be on course to buy 10 percent of the forthcoming IPO, Seeking Alpha said. Apple's cars Apple Friday secured a permit for autonomous vehicle testing in California, according to various news outlets. Fox Business reported Friday that the permit was awarded by California's Department of Motor Vehicles and that it is Apple's first for autonomous cars. The outlet also noted that the permit allows Apple to test its cars on public roads. The Wall Street Journal, meanwhile, described the issuing of the permit as "the clearest sign to date of progress in [Apple's] secretive efforts to develop self-driving car technology". Apple is pitting itself against Tesla, Google, Uber and General Motors, according to Seeking Alpha. Semiconductors' revenue Worldwide semiconductor revenue is set to hit $386 billion in 2017, according to the latest research from Gartner. The analyst said that the 12.3 percent rise comes after favorable market conditions meant an increase in momentum in Q2 2016, in particular for commodity memory. This will likely be corrected, however, in 2019 by additional capacity in DRAM and NAND flash, according to Jon Erensen, research director at Gartner. "While price increases for both DRAM and NAND flash memory are raising the outlook for the overall semiconductor market, it will also put pressure on margins for system vendors of smartphones, PCs and servers," Erensen said. "Component shortages, a rising bill of materials and the prospect of having to counter by raising average selling prices will create a volatile market in 2017 and 2018."   Tweet   Facebook   LinkedIn   Google plus   Send to   Topics Channel Business Channel Rundown Google Apple Internet of Things (IoT) Semiconductor Gartner Cyber Crime Cyber security DDoS More on Channel Business Channel Business Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 14 April 2017 14 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 14 April 2017 14 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 13 April 2017 13 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 12 April 2017 12 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 11 April 2017 11 Apr Solution Provider Channel still lacking confidence in digital transformation strategies 11 Apr Channel Business Today's channel rundown - 10 April 2017 10 Apr Channel Business Channelnomics story of the month - March 2017 10 Apr More news Hybrid cloud driving solution provider demand among Oracle users As vendor builds cloud business, end users are turning to channel partners for integration help Solution Provider 17 April 2017 Today's channel rundown - 17 April 2017 Daily tech news and analysis channel partners need to know now, including Google's Russia deal, Cloudera's IPO, semiconductors' revenue and more Channel Business 17 April 2017 Entry-level today, managers tomorrow: Tapping the millennial workforce Amid an aging channel, players are seeing millennials as strategy People 17 April 2017 Editor's voice: The week's channel chatter - 14 April 2017 What's been happening this week on Channelnomics?

In addition to paying a $7.8 million fine, Google has agreed to stop preventing phone manufacturers from changing the default search engine to anything but Google. Google won’t be allowed to require any app exclusivity on new phones, nor will it be allowed to prevent other companies’ apps from coming preinstalled. This is a big win for Yandex, Russia’s top search engine While Android is an open platform, core parts of the operating system aren’t, including Google’s app store. That’s allowed Google to set strict conditions for any phone manufacturer that wants to build a phone with access to the Play Store’s millions of apps. Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service said this counted as an abuse of Google’s dominant market position, and for the past two years, it’s been investigating and suing over the company’s restrictive terms. The suit followed a complaint from Yandex, a major Russian search company, which is one of the biggest winners of this settlement. Yandex will now be able to reach agreements with phone manufacturers to have its search engine preinstalled on Android phones, which can slow Google’s expansion in Russia and bolster its own. “Competition breeds innovation.” Yandex Arkady Volozh actually put out a statement on the settlement, calling the agreement “an important day for Russian consumers.” While the message is necessarily critical of Google, Volozh takes a moment to thank his competitor “for recognizing the value of openness.” “Competition breeds innovation,” Volozh writes. “It’s our desire to participate in a market where users can choose the best services available.” Google has also agreed to soon offer a “Chrome widget” that will let Android users in Russia choose a default search engine aside from Google. Any developer that signs a “commercial agreement” with Google can be included — Yandex is the first to sign up. “We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia’s competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service, resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

The concession follows an out-of-court deal with the country's competition watchdog. In addition, Google has promised to develop a tool to make it easy for users to change their device's default search engine. Shares in Google's local Russian rival, Yandex, rose more than 7% on the news. It brings to an end a long-running battle between the US firm and Russia's competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). Google had argued the regulator had no case because manufacturers could develop their own versions of Android or pre-install other apps of their choice. But the FAS had argued that, despite its denials, Google was indeed "prohibiting" rival software to its own YouTube, Maps and Photos apps to be pre-installed alongside its own dominant version of Android. The agency became involved after Yandex filed a complaint in February 2015. Despite the nature of the settlement, Google will still have to pay a 438m rouble ($7.8; £6.2m) fine imposed after it failed to appeal the case last August. "We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia's competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android," a spokeswoman for Google told the BBC. Yandex's chief executive Arkady Volozh declared the settlement "an important day for Russian consumers". "I am thankful to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for applying the law in a manner that effectively and efficiently restores competition to the market for the benefit of Russian users, as competition always breeds innovation," he added. The EU continues to pursue similar claims against Google, saying the firm is "requiring and incentivising" Android hardware manufacturers to exclusively use its services.

Balancing Act with Heidi Stevens Life & Style Heidi Stevens My daughter went to Mexico, and all I got was a giant dose of parenting perspective Time with kid Bernd Vogel / Image Bank A spring break trip can remind moms and dads that kids need a lot more than one-on-one time with parents to thrive. A spring break trip can remind moms and dads that kids need a lot more than one-on-one time with parents to thrive. (Bernd Vogel / Image Bank) Heidi StevensContact ReporterBalancing Act I spent a lot of spring break thinking what a good mom I'd be if I only had one kid. My 11-year-old daughter went to Mexico for five days with her friend and her friend's (extremely generous, very brave) mom, which left me the bulk of the week off with just my 7-year-old son. We ran around outside. We tried Topgolf. We played Monopoly NFL. We took our time. One day my son told me his classmate had said left-handed people are stupid and he refuses to be friends with them. My son is left-handed. I suggested he could tell his classmate, "Your loss." "What's 'Your loss?'" he asked. RELATED: TRENDING LIFE & STYLE NEWS THIS HOUR I told him his classmate would be the one missing out if he goes through life refusing to be friends with left-handed people. I told him to think of all the Chicago Cubs who bat left-handed. "Which ones?" my son asked. I had no idea, obviously. I only said that because I figured he knew some. We Googled it and discovered several: Miguel Montero. Kyle Schwarber. Aroldis Chapman. (He was a Cub when they won the World Series, so we counted him.) This led us to Google famous left-handed athletes. (Babe Ruth!) Which led us to Google left-handed presidents. (Barack Obama!) Which led us to Google left-handed celebrities. (Oprah!) "So you're telling me if Kyle Schwarber, Babe Ruth, Barack Obama and Oprah showed up at his house and asked him to hang out, he'd say no?" I asked my son. We laughed and Googled some more about lefties. Partly because it was fun and interesting, but mostly because we had time. We didn't have to pause and drive my daughter to practice. I didn't have to hop up midsentence and help her find that one pair of shorts. I wasn't worried about spending more time with him than I was with her. I missed my daughter. A lot. But I was really rocking this parenting thing without her. How can I spend only-child amounts of time with children who aren't onlies? I wondered. Schedule more solo time with each kid? Quit my job? Drop not-very-subtle hints that my children are available, one at a time, to join other people's family vacations? That's when I realized my own shortsightedness. My daughter was in Mexico, creating memories that would last her, I'm quite certain, a lifetime. She'll never forget the first time she left the country without her mom. She'll never forget the time she and her friend sported Lycra mermaid tails and swam up to the poolside bar for mango smoothies — a scene captured for me via iPhone camera and transmitted cross-country via WhatsApp. She'll always know that someone else's mom thought warmly and highly enough of her to invite her on vacation. She'll always know her own mom had enough faith in her good judgment and independent spirit to let her go. Those truths will hold different meaning to her as she grows up, but they'll always be with her. Maybe they'll even shape her as she goes — into a person who takes adventures, into a person who takes risks, into a person who remembers that fun and safety can exist outside your family as well as inside it. I want those things for my kids. And they won't learn them from endless one-on-one time with me. They need each other. And alone time. And friends. And friends' parents. And teachers. And coaches. And precocious little classmates who tell them lefties are stupid. They need a lot that I can't give them, in other words. No matter how much uninterrupted time I have. "Prepare the child for the path, not the path for the child" is one of my favorite parenting sayings. I first encountered it from author Betsy Brown Braun, whose books were beacons of light for me when my kids were younger. They need to know I'm in their corner, cheering and coaxing and comforting and all those other parent jobs. But life doesn't happen in a corner. The best I can do, I decided, is savor the one-on-one times when they fall in my lap, even as I remember they're only a portion of what my kids need to flourish and grow into their big, full lives. "Roots and wings, baby," a friend commented on Facebook when I posted a photo of my daughter and me, reunited after her trip — a reference to another parenting saying I love: "There are two gifts we should give our children. One is roots; the other is wings." Our undivided attention is also lovely and important. But they don't really need it to fly. hstevens@chicagotribune.com Twitter @heidistevens13 RELATED STORIES:  In defense of opposite-sex friendships Heroic parenting isn't nearly as daunting as it sounds 'Strong Is the New Pretty' shows girls in their muddy, messy glory Vinyl is back in a big way.

Unsupported: The best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/07 11:53am PDTApr 7, 2017 40 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares168 Editorials Nexus 6 Article Contents 1 Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? 2 LineageOS 3 The Good 4 The Not So Good 5 AOSPA (Mostly Dead) 6 The Good 7 The Not So Good 8 Pure Nexus Project 9 The Good 10 The Not So Good 11 OmniROM 12 The Good 13 The Not So Good 14 Dirty Unicorns 15 The Good 16 The Not So Good 17 Etc. 18 Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus As of April 3rd, 2017 the Nexus 6/Shamu has truly reached end of life status. Although we knew it was coming, it seems it was easier to keep the buildbots running until more major changes were made. We’d like to take this time to sit back and reminisce on our fond, and large, memories of the device. Death, however, is not the end, but a new beginning. Or, at least, an excuse for those of us without upgrade fever to move ourselves over to a nice and shiny new ROM. While Google may have given up on Shamu, some devices just can’t stay down. And there are a few different flavors for your favorite fish out there. Free Willy, or what now to do with your Shamu? We all know what is dead may never die (as long as your kernel sources oblige), but I’m going to operate under the premise that we’ve all made it past denial and bargaining and into acceptance on the sad but inevitable fate of Shamu. Fortunately there are a some options for software going forward detailed below, and it's worth taking the time to sit down and consider exactly what you want and need. An important aside, this should be an informed decision. Installing any other operating systems on your Nexus device will potentially void your (probably already expired) warranty, and the process required to do so can result in a dead device if you make any significant mistakes. Additionally, the security of your device might be more easily compromised, and as a result of that potential liability a number of developers of applications (such as mobile banking apps and some games) do their best to block such devices from using their applications. As a general note you should be aware that camera support can be poor in many ROMs for many devices, as a result of missing binaries. The Nexus 6 doesn't use any closed binaries for the camera, so that's not a significant concern here, but it's worth keeping in mind if you're looking at this list for another device or decide you want to stick with a ROM you like when you move to a new one. Unlocking your bootloader, installing a ROM or custom recovery (and rooting, if that's your preference) are all things that should only be done when you understand the steps involved and the risks associated. Remember: a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. Unfortunately, as Google's base AOSP has gotten better and added more of the type of features people used to use ROMs for, fewer new basic features have been wanted by the sort of power-users that spearhead ROM development. A lot of the old projects have fallen by the wayside. LineageOS For those who haven’t followed things, LineageOS is the continuation of the popular CyanogenMod Android ROM, and that is a long and storied history in all regards. It’s been around in commercial and noncommercial forms since 2009, and although its most up-to-date releases (based on Android 7.1.1) are labeled as nightlies they are (mostly) stable. It’s basically a "stock+" ROM based on a blend of the CAF sources released by Qualcomm and Google’s AOSP (the Android Open Source Project handled by Google), but it does have a lot of extra features added in. For those hoping to hang onto their devices for a couple of years while still reaping the benefits of monthly security updates, LineageOS is probably your best bet, and my personal recommendation. Download. The Good Features At this point the LineageOS devs know pretty well what features to include and ignore. They aren't as heavy-handed as some other groups are with their changes, and most of the stuff you'll find is fairly basic. They've got their own launcher, EQ, a filesystem explorer, and basic modifications to things like notifications, battery icons, and reboot menus. Nothing too over the top. Updates LineageOS gets nightly builds (that are actually weekly builds, called nightlies), and usually gets updated to the latest released version of Android after only a short delay. Support Everyone uses LineageOS, so if you run into an issue, odds are someone else has and you'll find a solution or be more likely to get help. Device Selection Incredibly huge list of supported devices. If you decide you like LineageOS and want to use it on your next phone or tablet, it's very likely to be supported. The Not So Good Features Compared to some of the others on this list LineageOS is comparatively bare-bones, which could be a con. AOSPA (Mostly Dead) AOSPA, now mostly dead, used to go by the name Paranoid Android and has a shorter history than some of the other ROMs here. Their release schedule has also slowed down (read: stopped) quite a bit since OnePlus hired a few of the developers. As a result the latest release they have available for Shamu is fairly old, sitting at 6.0.3. For perspective it’s worth noting that 6.0 (Marshmallow) originally came out in 2015, and even then the AOSPA release didn't land until mid 2016. For the security conscious or those wanting to run the latest versions, the probable lack of future support and no regular build schedule or nightly release is a significant impediment, but AOSPA has a reputation of stability and an excellent feature set, and historically they were on the bleeding edge of interesting new features and modifications for stock Android. Maybe they will be again, someday. Download. The Good Features Pretty basic, which can be a plus for beginners. As with every ROM you'll get some nice new features, all the basics like battery icons, reboot menus, status bar/notification customization, etc. Nothing too intense. Stability They don't do nightlies, each release is intended to be stable. Themes It's got the old CyanogenMod Theme Engine, which means you've got a huge selection. Device Selection Not as expansive as LineageOS, but most Nexus and OnePlus devices are supported, as well as a handful of other easily unlocked devices. The Not So Good Probably Dead No updates in almost a year, but they could come back. Out of Date Current build is really pretty old, only 6.0.3. Features Pretty light on modifications these days, which can be a con if you decide you dig tweaks. Pure Nexus Project The Pure Nexus Project is only a few years old, but it’s become one of the most popular AOSP-based (based on Google’s open-source android code) distributions for turning phones into faux Nexus/Pixel devices, and is especially popular in regards to the Nexus 6. It is currently sitting at Android 7.1.1, and has a good record of receiving regular updates in the past. But it is worth keeping in mind that, although it's quite popular now, compared to LineageOS or AOSPA in its heyday it is a smaller project. Download. The Good Low-budget Pixel If you want one, but don't want to pay the price, you can get close. Pure Nexus takes a very Googly approach to their design, porting over a hand-full of features from Pixel devices that you won't see on many other ROMs, like Pixel-style software keys, the Pixel launcher, and pixel-stock GApps. Features In addition to the Pixel changes you also get all the regular ROM tweaks you'd expect like notification tray customization, battery icons, notification light control, etc. Themes One of the few large 7.x ROMs with current theme support via substratum. Volume Control Pre 7.x-type volume controls options. The Not So Good Device Support As the name suggests, their primary development is for Pixel/Nexus devices, although there are some unofficial builds about for others. OmniROM OmniROM is one of the older ones. Created when Cyanogen took things commercial, it historically takes the old-school CM approach to ROM building: whatever fits. They even helped pioneer early multi-window efforts. It's got an AOSP base and a lot of unique features, but it also takes a bit more of a customized kitchen-sink approach to things. That method of including every possible feature can be overwhelming if you're new to ROMs, but it does offer an unarguable degree of customization. Download. The Good Updates Nightlies! Features Want to customize the precise sensitivity of the Flick2Wake gesture? A Launcher with adjustable grids and hotwords? the OmniSwitch recents menu? If an omelet, for you, is an exercise in fitting your entire fridge inside a pan, you'll like OmniROM. And, of course, it's got all the basic changes you'd expect, too. Updates Omni sometimes sees updates faster than LineageOS, even. Device Selection OmniROM supports a good number of devices The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but OmniROM has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Dirty Unicorns Dirty Unicorns is old, originally based on AOKP (my all-time favorite historical ROM) but now usually an AOSP/CAF base. It has a slim but still solid number of supported devices, two lines of their own GAPPS packages (which is kind of insane), and its famous "Dirty-Tweaks." If you thought OmniROM had a lot going on, Dirty Unicorn takes things even further. These guys are prolific and communicative developers, and Dirty Unicorns is probably my 2nd favorite ROM these days behind LineageOS. Just like OmniROM, though, it can be overwhelming for newcomers used to sailing stock on their Shamu. Download. The Good Features Changes abound, there's a whole lot to customize. In addition to all the basics you'd expect mentioned above you've got a ton of changes, even basic device interaction methods like the nav bar present new options for things like gestures. And it inherits OmniROM's OmniSwitch option. Even more nice, navigating all the options in Dirty Unicorns isn't actually too difficult with their famous Dirty-Tweaks settings pane. Themes One of the few, if that's your thing. Substratum based. Updates It might not have nightlies, but it gets updated fairly frequently. However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS. Device Selection Most of the devices on this list are the sort of devices you want if you're into ROMs anyway. The Not So Good Not For the Faint of Heart Not necessarily a con, but Dirty Unicorns, like OmniROM, has a whole lot going on. (Or, on the plus, it has a whole lot going on.) Etc. There are plenty of other distributions available for the Nexus 6 worthy of note, like Bliss ROM's builds and Ressurection Remix, but many of them are a bit less focused on general use, less frequently updated, or unofficial and unsupported individual projects. For the truly adventurous, however, the options are there, and some have very interesting or unique features. But, be fully prepared for home-made ROMs to have weird bugs, include potential privacy concerns, or to end development at inconvenient times. Spring, Summer, Fall, Dead Nexus Shamu may have reached Autumn in Google's eyes, but it doesn't have to in our hearts. Thankfully you have some choices to make when you're finally ready to put it down and move on. Although, I don't think anyone would blame you for making eyes at a Pixel XL. Again, be sure that you're willing to handle the responsibility and risks involved. I recommend doing things the right (read: long) way. One-click solutions, auto-rooters, and toolboxes should be avoided. If learning to use CMD or bash scares you, you might be better off consigning your Shamu to his watery grave, and instead just buying a new phone. There are resources out there for collaborative help when you need it at places like XDA or reddit, but if you don't know how to pull a log or use ADB and fastboot you're not going to find a lot of sympathy. Education, as always, is key. And, frankly, ADB and fastboot aren't too difficult to learn to use. Update April 8, 2017: The story was revised, camera warnings made more specific and moved to the top, and more feature details and two more ROMs added at readers' requests.

Thanks.

They make big announcements and then leave people hanging for years just to come back with promises that they can't keep. P.S. That cover image is awesome! David Ruddock Yeah, we included it because, really, it's one of the few "proper" ROMs still out there for the N6 aside from Lineage and PNP. It's probably pretty stable and maybe some PA fans could still want some PA-specific features. Also, rare possibility somebody doesn't want to up to Nougat, I guess. Devin Rodriguez Truly a whale of a photoshop. Ryne Hager PA's future (or lack thereof) makes me sad, I hope they push some updates. Michael Weisberg Have you....used a Nexus 6 recently? Camera performance on this phone is notoriously bad, so most custom ROMs probably have BETTER camera performance than stock. Also, why would you recommend a Marshmallow ROM that isn't being developed anymore? Kenneth Porter I think he was just trying to give the lay of the land as opposed to recommending mx3 "Unsupported: the best Nexus 6 ROMs to check out in a post-update world" Devin Rodriguez It's out of date for sure, but it's still a good ROM. Jesse Lee No... no it's not, that's the point. It WAS a good ROM, on devices pre N6. What's the title of the article again.

Per the article in regards to Lineage "my personal recommendation" Ryne Hager Yeah, the camera is pretty terrible, but even so I figured if anyone used this to make a decision about another device it was worth including. Tim R. NX Camera makes it bearable again. But it will be a lovely day when I can upgrade to something with a better camera. operator207 To give a real world example of camera performance; I have PureNexus (7.1.1) on my N6. I took a picture with "auto flash" turned on, in a dark room, and the flash didn't go off. I assumed the picture would be a black nothing. It wasn't. I could see the difference between the black leather couch, the dark blue blanket and the dark brown cat laying on the blanket. It was MUCH better than I thought it would be. I could not see squat in the view finder when I took the picture, it was a black blob. Running the stock rom for the N6 (MM 6.0.1 was the last version I ran) the flash would have needed to be used, or if it hadn't, the picture would have been horrible. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I'm a big fan of OmniROM. It doesn't get the attention of some of the others, but it's been stable for me, and gets great battery life. https://forum.xda-developers.com/nexus-6/orig-development/rom-omni-rom-t2968425 Ryne Hager Omni info is up! balthazar Omni is really great. More people should check it out Marty I just use LineageOS on my N6. But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum and ask about support for any device not already listed....lol. It's an unforgivable sin and you will face wrath. 😉 Carson Saldanha Bet you've had personal experience in that, haven't you? 😂 Marty It's how I know the flavor of wrath it brings...lol keithzg But whatever you do, don't go to the LineageOS Reddit forum FTFY ;) Davin Peterson LineageOS is available several older unsupported Nexus devices such as the 2013 Nexus 7. It works well on my 2013 Nexus 7. h4rr4r There are unofficial builds for even the 2012 N7. I have one at the office that works ok. Ernie Manning Been on Pure Nexus since I found out the developer was making ROMs for it. (He was making ROMs for the Note 2 previously as well) I have tried other ROMs but keep coming back to it as it is the most stable. Carson Saldanha How close is the UI to stock? I just want a ROM that's up-to-date and stock. T4rd It's just like using a Pixel, basically. Doesn't get much more stock than that. Carson Saldanha Sweet, do you recommend it over Lineage OS? T4rd I can't personally speak towards Lineage, as I've never used it. Because the last year I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P, it hasn't given me any reason to try another ROM. Carson Saldanha Ok, thanks man. 👌 Ernie Manning I would recommend over any ROM. If you look on the XDA Developers page for it you can see it has the most users. Kyle Lyles 100% in agreement with you. Jesse Lee Ahhh... it's Pure Nexus, says it all. (Pure Pixel technically now) robert lemons jr Man where is Dirty Unicorns? Ryne Hager I'll def add Dirty Unicorns, expect it. Grojnak Yeah!! DU is the best ROM out there ddevito I love my Op3 in every way, but I do miss my Shamu's screen. I also miss how legendary it felt in my hands, it was a well designed tank. Marty I bet you had a hard time carrying it, though...as little as you are. 😋 Ryne Hager Shamu nestled so nice in the palm. But I definitely don't miss the inaccurate colors on it, way over-saturated. The OP3 has that sweet sweet sRGB calibrated mode. Jamiejkrebs Google is paying $97 per hour!

Latheryin You missed dirty unicorns which was the first to release 7.1.2 for the shamu. Also most of the bugs you mention are only in Rome based of LOS/CM. Rudresh Please share some for the N7 2013 too, pretty please! R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Some one yesterday was reporting Nexus 6 getting Android O was confirmed by Google. waloody88 i also read it, but it was from just one source. probably fake. Carson Saldanha #fakenews Suicide_Note It's not, and it wasn't. someone755 You mention Pure Nexus and RR but no Carbon or Omni. Great work, you just lost any credibility in regards to custom ROMs. marcusmarcus2 http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/frowny_face_supernatural.gif someone755 Make jokes all you want, but when you're done I'd advise you to read up on RR and PN. marcusmarcus2 I'll never be done but http://i.imgur.com/xpk30mU.gif Nate What's wrong with PN someone seems a little salty, David said the scope of the article was near stock experience... marcusmarcus2 The article even says "the options are there" with a link to a ton of different ROMs for it. Going through the list, I see Carbon and OMNI ROMs. So he covered it well enough. Alex Cruz Yeah I want to know what exactly is wrong with PN. I mean I could see the knock on RR but if we're talking about near stock experience, I don't see the beef there with PN. Not unless you're a salty mofo because you're on a zombie ROM (Carbon) Ryne Hager Omni isn't bad, but it can be a bit kitchen sink and I've had some stability issues with it in the past. However, that's a legit point, I'll add Omni in. Carson Saldanha For a new writer, you're getting quite the bit of harsh criticism. Sucks. 🤷‍♂️ Devin Rodriguez He can take it. He's a strong independent writer who don't need no comments! marcusmarcus2 That's right. Plus he seems very responsive in the comments anyway, not taking any of the comments poorly. Hey @ryne_hager:disqus https://media.tenor.co/images/d1bcd7be62c1f27d4e6978ad3cd2ab29/tenor.gif Devin Rodriguez I like you with the gifs, and all from Supernatural I just realized. marcusmarcus2 Well shucks http://i1255.photobucket.com/albums/hh640/mimajki/Feedback%20gifs%202/tumblr_m42wgjg6E11qgtbrgo7_r2_250.gif Miku is Best Vocaloid You missed "sassy". Devin Rodriguez By gum you are right! Edited! Ryne Hager No worries, that's part of how it works. And really, I should have included Omni, it was an oversight that was later supplemented. Really, I'm just happy to get to work on stuff I enjoy. Biff Wonsley Probably outside the scope of this offering, but you can also get some extra functionality & options using alternative kernels. Kyle Lyles Pure Nexus with Franco's kernel is an excellent combo. 11 hrs of decent use on my N6 Knowledgeborn Allah RIP to the Nexus 6... Kyle Lyles Nothing out there that makes me want to migrate elsewhere. I'm likely to go to an iPhone 8+ after 9 yrs with Android and 8 yrs with Palm before that.Yeah, yeah, yeah, I've heard it all... Knowledgeborn Allah Honestly, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I spent 6 years on Android, primarily with Nexus devices, and last year I bought an iPhone 7+. Now, I still like Android, and I have a Pixel XL, which is a decent device; but I'd say that getting an iPhone was one of the best decisions I've made. I'm not saying the iPhone changed my life or anything (LOL), but it's turned out to be the best smartphone I've ever purchased. There's nothing wrong with checking out other stuff, and if you like it, use it. Fanboyism is played out. Тарас Мукин PureNexus is the best choice, I think. I use it on my Xiaomi as well and I love how I don't have to deal with all the stuff like GApps, kernels, theme (I love Pixel's blue), setting up or updating. Maybe it is not the best in all the aspects, but it is easy and it works. Carson Saldanha Could you define "not the best in all the aspects"? What's the cons you've experienced? Тарас Мукин I mean some small stuff. Additional customization options are basic, some ROMs can offer bizzare levels if changing everything. Some other ROMs (or other kernels) can squeeze out more battery life. Others sacrifice all that to bring speed. And some people want some of this stuff. But it always comes with a price of stability and simplicity of installation — so I prefer PireNexus. For example my previous ROM had "snartbar" instead of regular navbar. Different animations for button pressing, gesture mode (1 button and swipes), themes for other stuff — but 1 in 10 apps didn't understand it. Telegram was just breaking on some screens with this "smartbar", and buttons weren't even pressing correctly a lot of times. Now I have simple Pixel navbar — but it freaking works. Carson Saldanha Thanks for the info man! 👌 T4rd Indeed, I've been running Pure Nexus ROM on my 6P for the last year I've had it and couldn't ask for any more in a ROM. Performance, stability, and battery life are as good, if not better than stock, and the additional tweaks and options are pretty nice. Carson Saldanha Guys, LineageOS or Pure Nexus Project? I want something that's up-to-date and as close to stock as possible, but I also want it stable. Which do you recommend for my N6? Suicide_Note Pure Nexus Trav Montana I still have mine , jumped to the 6P last October and been happy with ever since. At first tho I did miss the buig screen size but got use to the slightly smaller screen. On a side note I really wished Google would've came out with bigger Nexus 5 since that was my favorite Nexus phone til date :( iFeign I'm hoping somebody creates a ROM like Fake Nexus for the N4, which is just compiled from source and can be sideloaded like an official OTA. Devin Rodriguez ITT: People are upset about their ROM of choice not being mentioned. Alex Cruz OnePlus 3T is the best! magnamentis i'm quite sure that you did not run so many of the roms you mentioned yourself recently and none of the unmentioned. i on the other hand have used all the roms you've mentioned and a few more and can definitely not agree with almost anything in your article and that's quite rare. i really like to comment on good stuff as some of your fellow authors know but this is no seriously and thorougly elvaluated. to recommend lineage which is the base for most other custom roms means that any stable custom rom that is based on linage but has more and at times very useful features is better than lineage because it has all that lineage has + what i said. the best maintained over the last few years, most devices as well as dedicated core team that brings the base to a stable state (including add-ons) often within no time and that is clearly ResurrectionRemix and before the heads left bliss, bliss was once on par for one season. mentioning a dead (for long) rom on second position is ( won't say but nothing good comes to my mind and they failed dearly on Oneplus development as well ) however i have no fixed preference but after using dozens of roms on dozens of devices and at a very sophisticated and loaded level, including xposed and the likes before nougat, i can say that over the last 4 years i switched on device after another (currently 6 active) to RR, always keeping an eye on alternatives and cataclysm for N5 and N6 was king. Steven Murphy WTF no OmniROM mention???? jibust Another vote for OmniROM. Truly the most stable of the 7.1.1 roms. Ryne Hager Legit omission on my part, it's added. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) I'd suggest a ROM like Dirty Unicorns...you'll get Android 7.1.2 :) Ryne Hager Hey now, we've got kids here. Don't tempt them with that, they're liable to become ROM crazed monsters if you start them out on the hard stuff. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Tempt them with what ? ^^ A nice ROM ? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) DU is AOSP based btw :) Ryne Hager Did they cut the CAF inherited from OMNI? Ryne Hager Yup, looks like the switched to CAF from Omni on L, I'll correct. YaKillaCJ Lol Dirty Unicorn and Resurrection Remix are definitely on the hard end. For us who been at this a long time, we embrace cutting edge options. For the newbie, they definitely could get overwhelmed. balthazar Where is Slim btw? Alex Cruz Oh look another Zombie ROM! Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) A ROM that stole Substratum doesnt deserve a spot on the list :) balthazar oh, is that still going on? I thought things have been settled? Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Its been settled...but they still did it you know :) balthazar I don't know what they do or don't do as I don't use Slim. If everything's settled there shouldn't be any more hard feelings, you know Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Well when someone said that they stole it they denied it and said that they wrote it themselves...they are shamelss liars :) balthazar Well this sucks lol 30014 When I was a kid watching free willy, the scene this post is riffing on brought tears to my eyes. When the Michael Jackson song started playing I really felt it. keithzg I'm just going to take this opportunity to lament that the phones Google has released since have had progressively smaller displays. Hell, the Pixel XL is small enough screen-wise that if my 6P dies and I have to upgrade to it I might end up carrying a tablet around again! If only the 6 had had a fingerprint scanner where they originally intended, and the camera hadn't been so goddamn slow, I would have been sorely tempted to fork out for a replacement screen rather than just slapping a screen protector on it when it cracked and giving it to my flatmate whose Nexus 5 finally gave up the ghost (well, stopped being able to use the cellular radio, which made it just a very small wifi tablet, heh). Suicide_Note Early rumors suggest the next Pixel XL, codenamed Muskie, may be bigger than the current XL. There's also the device 'Taimen' that's bigger still, but no one knows if it's a larger display phone a'la the S8+, or if it's a new tablet. Bewear It's nice to see you guys giving custom ROMs some love :) Ryne Hager Oh my god it's a Pokemon. Bewear Well, it happens that we can install custom ROMs too. Geoff Johnson I would disagree with the camera. On phones from Samsung, LG, HTC, etc. that have their own camera software, there usually is a large difference in camera performance, but on stock Android phones like Nexus/Google, there is rarely any negative difference regarding the camera. Ryne Hager For the N6 you are exactly right. And for other devices it depends on whether they use any closed-source secret sauce to parse photos. I really just wanted to include the mention of it, since it does have an effect on devices using closed binaries, for anyone who might use this outside it's intended Shamu-related purpose. Indefinite Implosion Anyone know the best nexus-like ROM for Nexus 4 now that fake nexus has stopped being updated? DanSan Still rocking my Nexus 6… I hate to see it go but its age is definitely showing. Apps are slow as hell, camera is horrible too. Really wish they'd make a new version just like it but looks like I'm switching to the GS8+ Ryne Hager Man, have you seen the screen on that thing? 1000 nits and all those calibrated color spaces, it's super exciting. DanSan Oh hell yeah I did. I fell in love. Got to play with them the day after it was announced. Samsung rep at Best buy let me have fun before he put them on display https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/22f6785bd8af78d427f6eb1464b6114bb93a161258becc9c5becd893436fe11f.jpg Ryne Hager Man, I'd be all over one of those, but I'm a junkie for easily unlocked bootloaders. Plus, that price is painful. Grojnak You say about Dirty Unicorns: "However, expect a larger delay at major version releases compared to OmniROM or LineageOS." Well, today they released their version 11.3, based on Android 7.1.2, only 4 days after Google. Any other rom (neither your beloved Lineage) did that. tehboogieman Can I suggest doing a similar article for Hammerhead? pointman_12 pure nexus is a great rom...i was on chroma until the dev stopped supporting it...glad PN is around...will use my N6 until it dies or PN is gone...i'm cheap... JustAnotherG Meh, GZR ROMs ignored while PA is included? Tipsy, Tesla and Validus are all up to date and updated regularly, and all are full OMS, stop showing favoritism, Android Police. Char G Dn Bro a bricked device isn’t the worst case scenario, the really bad things just start there. This line is funny to me. I totally agree with it to just the other day I went to update my phone ROM and accidentally wiped internal memory along with everything else. I had never done that before. It was quite the adventure learning how to fix that one. Kyle Lyles Almost impossible to truly brick an Android. I've tried every way possible, couldn't do it. SVTCobra Really only happens to developers trying to hack around things like locked bootloaders. They do a good job of releasing relatively safe software. YaKillaCJ Oh it's possible with locked down devices. These devices tend to need backdoors just to get access to certain partitions. Power failure or the wrong command can force the need to take the device apart and/or a special cable. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) Impossible to brick a Nexus device yes....any other devices like Samsung with their Stupid Knox are easy to brick PhantomGamers I managed to brick my N6 by fastboot flashing the latest update, making sure it boots, and then locking my bootloader which then caused me to bootloop when starting. Tried everything to unbrick it, but couldn't reunlock it because it required me to toggle a setting in developer options which would have required it to boot in the first place. I guess pro tip would be to always wipe data FIRST and then confirm it boots before relocking bootloader. TomCos My N6 is almost as unusable as my N4 was after 3 years. Not sure I really understand why either.... Kyle Lyles And what makes it unusable? operator207 If it was like mine, it needed a full wipe and load of a ROM. If I had not done that, I would feel the same way. It was slow and sluggish before the wipe. I moved to PN, but I am sure if I had reloaded a stock ROM, it would have been peppy too. Also, I have heard that if you just upgrade from one major revision to the next (6.x -> 7.x) you can have slowness as well. TomCos My N6 and N4 both have an unbelievable lagg in the display. Sometimes it can take up to 10 seconds for the gui to reply to input. Same story on both devices, latest OS. Jesse Lee AOSPA... seriously? Lost credibility immediately throwing that in here at all. GZR, Nitrogen, AOSiP, Cyanide, list goes on and on before mentioning PA in the same sentence with N6. Dan Gwinn Do these alternate ROMs fully support Project Fi? Kevin Vesga Pure Nexus does afaik. Other ROMs could work too. You just need to make sure you have Project Fi and Google Connectivity Services installed as system apps. Tamil Not entirely relevant to this article, but the best custom ROM experience I got was with my Nexus 5, and the ROM was developed by psychopompos. Tried a hell lot of custom ROMs with different nexuses, but that guy was awesome, he developed a super smooth, stable ROM that even put the stock ROM into shame. Too bad that he chose a different driection. There always be different developers who do phenomenal job on building ROMs and may not get the attention they deserve. So, it is in a way crude to list out a few ROMs and get the attention only to them. I don't say those ROMs are bad, infact I'm using purenexus in my 6p, but quite a lot of users may think like these are their only options, which is not fair IMO. Anyways, talking about customs ROMs in AP, it's a good head start, may be you can start a section like ROM of the week or ROM of the month or conduct polls for favourite ROMs, that may help a few good developers to come into notice. RNTMPX It's the most beautiful Nexus phone ever build! I think that's the way a phone should looks like. A phone for MENS! Roh_Mish I remember KitKat AOSPA 4.99RC2. the most stable ROM I'd had on my nexus 4. Chris sorry. just to clarify, will Lineage roll out a stable 7.1.2 ROM for nexus 6? It's kind of hard to believe that Google rolled it out then downgraded everyone instead of supporting their device. I was looking into LiquidSmooth (maybe called LiquidDark now) awhile back but it looks like it's stopped development. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you want 7.1.2 better switch the ROM :) Anthony Marz Should have mentioned nitrogen os. I use it on my 5 yo Nexus 4 mako and aside from the hardware, my Nexus 4 is a pixel EowynCarter I don't really want to mess up with custom ROM again. I liked the 'just works' :( Is there a rim that works like the stock rom? Install, and then one click OTA? Max Johnson Lineage OS probably. But if it work anything like CyanogenMod, you'll get nightly update which you can choose to install (bad idea for stability), and once a while there will be a stable release. I haven't use Lineage OS though, I'm sure they're going to improve it over CM, but I don't plan to root or custom Rom from now on. Stock Android or "stockish" and iOS only from now. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) If you read the Article you would have know that PureNexus is pretty much stock... LineageOS is always a bad idea btw EowynCarter I did read the article, but it don't mention anything about how updates are done. Simon Schürrle (SitiSchu) They have a OTA updater app :) hkklife Google must be thrilled. The last Nexus/Pixel device with wireless charging and a man-sized screen is offically EOL. kmand I keep seeing articles about Nexus 6 and Android 8.0. For example http://www.droidreport.com/articles/5965/20170406/google-nexus-6-reportedly-eligible-for-android-8-0-update.htm It seems a little late for April fools. Is this some echoing fake news. abc Shame about Paranoid Android. Loved that ROM back in the days when Google had just ditched updates for the Galaxy Nexus.

It doesn’t look like there’s anything to note about the purchase in terms of its relation to Tesla, however, besides its physical proximity… Book a Free Smart Home Consultation w/ Amazon Services The report notes that Google plans to “eventually” build a data center on those 1,210 acres, part of the 107,000-acre Tahoe Reno Industrial Center. Google last week bought land stretching across 1,210 acres at a private industrial park east of Reno, Nev., for $29.1 million, according to people familiar with the deal and documents filed late Friday in Storey County, Nev. The Alphabet Inc. unit aims eventually to build a data center at the 107,000-acre Tahoe Reno Industrial Center, according to these people… Google paid $29.1 million for the land, the WSJ notes.

Yesterday GOOG: 837.17 13.61 Google drops Android pre-install restrictions on search engines, apps in Russia after settlement Abner Li - Apr. 17th 2017 9:08 am PT @technacity Android Russia View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Following a 2015 ruling of anti-monopoly behavior involving Android, Google has settled with Russia’s regulatory agency in an out-of-court deal. Google will allow apps and competing search engines to be pre-loaded on devices, with a new tool to select the latter. Nintendo Switch The complaint originated from rival Russian search engine Yandex, with anti-monopoly watchdog FAS imposing a 438 million rouble ($7.8 million) fine in 2016 after finding Google of abusing its market position. While Yandex framed the decision at the time as a way to “restore competition on the market,” it came as the search engine’s traffic began declining due to the popularity of Android. Google has yet to pay the monetary settlement, but this deal — which has already been approved in court — will be in effect for a period of six years and nine months. The company is dropping its demand for services exclusivity with no restrictions on the install of competing applications and search engines. As part of the latter, Google is also developing a tool that will allow users to select the default search engine. While Chrome allows users to easily change the search engine, there is no way at the system-level to have easy access to another engine.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Tuesday, 18 April 2017 | MYT 12:31 AM Google reaches RM35mil antitrust settlement with Russia Yandex, Russia’s biggest search engine, complained Google had an unfair advantage. The AFP photo shows Google’s headquarters in Mountain View, California. MOSCOW: Google on Monday agreed to pay a nearly US$8mil (RM35.2mil) fine and open its Android mobiles to competing search engines in Russia in an antitrust settlement reached after two years. The deal with Russia’s anti-monopoly service (FAS) came after Yandex, the country’s biggest search engine, complained Google had an unfair advantage by pre-loading its search engine on Android phones.  ”We are pleased to announce that we have now reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with FAS that meets the interests of all parties,” said Google in a comment emailed to AFP. For Android devices already in use in Russia, Google will work out a way for consumers to choose a default search engine after an update via a new widget that will be developed, the watchdog said. The FAS in September 2015 considered Google in breach of a competition law after the complaint by Yandex of the competitive advantage for Google on Android phones. In August 2016, FAS fined Google 438 million rubles (RM34.5mil) which was part of the settlement reached on Monday. The arbitration court in Moscow approved the deal which lasts for six years and nine months, Russian news agencies said. Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh called the settlement “an important day for Russian consumers” as “millions of Russian Android users will be offered a choice of search engines.” - AFP Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Technology , Google , Russia Related Stories Related Stories Google brings fake news fact-checking to search results UK increases pressure on Google Google changes ad policies again Apple, Amazon, Google join bidding for Toshiba chip unit - media Google campaign to help local SMEs go online You May Be Interested Mier pegs ringgit's fair value at RM4.20 versus US$ Breakfast briefing: Tuesday, April 18 (Update) Wall Street rallies in low volume led by banks, tech Ringgit opens lower against US$ early Tuesday How to own your first home with zero down payment Pedalling to save the planet Others Also Read Discovering Asia’s Las Vegas Driven by gratitude, not self-pity Verstappen apologises to Brazil for Massa remark Property Related advertisement Latest News Crude palm oil price falls deeper into bear market KWAP to take up 136.6m edotco shares for RM400m Malaysia's timber exports to improve 5% this year Mier pegs ringgit's fair value at RM4.20 versus US$ Higher Q1 earnings for I-Bhd as property demand remains strong Most Viewed in Business Property sector recorded 11.5% fall in volume in 2016 Noorazman appointed UEM Group deputy chairman MMHE secures RM1b job from Petronas Carigali Mier pegs ringgit's fair value at RM4.20 versus US$ Genting underpins KLCI advance, semicon shares shine Malaysian tech stocks put pedal to the metal on chip boom Ringgit opens lower against US$ early Tuesday SSM offers 70% discount on compounds for a limited time Speculation on PNB listing I&P put to rest Perodua to produce more EEV models advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Name: Subject: Message: YouTube TV review: can you finally cut your cable? Reviewsby David Imel13 hours ago 24 563 29 Broadcast television is one of those technologies that just doesn’t seem to want to die. Ever since the inception of the technology in 1927, television has been a staple in the lives of consumers across the globe. Though we’ve seen the internet revolutionize hundreds of industries since its birth, cable TV has been something that has stayed largely the same since it was originally monetized. Over the last couple of years however, a number of players have attempted to change the way we watch TV not by replacing broadcast television altogether, but by creating streaming services that give consumers access to both broadcast TV and pre-recorded series and movies. Services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video may have popularized the streaming revolution by offering instant access to TV shows and movies that consumers love, but something about live TV appeals to many consumers on a level that has been almost ingrained into the very fabric of media as we know it today. This was evident even when streaming first began a couple of years ago, and players like Roku and Hulu swept in to fill the void consumers so badly craved. Now, Google is looking into get into the game by offering (select) consumers instant access to live television as well as a select list of TV shows and movies for a monthly cost of $34.99. Is this price point enough to encourage consumers to cut their cables altogether and jump headfirst into the internet of everything? Let’s take a look. Design I am actually quite pumped about the design and control of this service, though that doesn’t mean I don’t have reservations about the implementation. If you’re a techie and know how to use Google services, the theory of YouTube TV is a dream come true. Having access to your favorite live and recorded content anywhere you want is absolutely fantastic, since it can be viewed anywhere as long as you are signed into your Google account. However, if you’re not quite as technical and are not used to Google services and the idea of “casting” content, you may be left wondering why you have to watch your shows on such a small screen. You don’t, of course, but Google doesn’t exactly advertise the existence of TV support. YouTube.com, and that cast button on the top, can be confusing for a crowd that has no idea what content mirroring is. This isn’t bashing the ability to do so at all, as it is a crucial aspect of the service, but it does beg the question as to whether or not Google should have just bundled a ‘TV’ section into the YouTube app itself. After all, many Smart TVs on the market today already include YouTube integration, and so a simple update to these apps would make it possible for folks to use YouTube TV without having to rely on casting from their phone. When you open the app, you are greeted with popular live TV that you can watch locally on your device, or send straight to your compatible smart TV or Chromecast for easy streaming. The service also showcases local television specific to your area, so you get the added benefit of being able to watch your favorite local content if that’s what you’re into. YouTube TV is simplistic enough that you shouldn't get lost in a ton of menus and options, and should be pretty easy for even the most tech-illiterate user. As you scroll down the app, you’re greeted with popular shows available for recording once they air, as well as a selection of movies included with the service. Though one might argue that the app is a little bland, that’s kind of the point. Google wants to make this app as easy to use as physically possible, and I’ve got to say they’ve done a pretty amazing job. Swiping to the left from the home menu brings you to your library, detailing all the content you’ve starred or recorded, while swiping right narrows your view to a selection of live TV available for streaming. The latter function is arguably the biggest selling point of Google’s new service. The design of this section is also pretty fantastic, as it shows you a variety of live channels available for streaming while showcasing a live feed of the top option you are currently viewing. Tapping on a selection brings you to a live feed of the channel while showing off upcoming content available on that channel, which I think is a great choice, since it essentially lets you ‘preview’ a show to decide whether or not it is interesting enough before you commit to throwing it up on the big screen. Overall I’m thoroughly impressed with the design of this app. It is simplistic enough that you shouldn’t get lost in a ton of menus and options, and should be pretty easy for even the most tech-illiterate user. Content Google has done a surprisingly good job in making sure that there was a decent amount of premium content available to users at the launch of YouTube TV. The live channels available for streaming on YouTube TV essentially mirrors the content you would have available on any major cable network, giving you access to things like NBC, ESPN, Disney Channel, and SyFy. There are 39 total channels currently available for watching on the basic plan, though you have the option to purchase Showtime and Fox Soccer Plus at an additional monthly fee. Showtime will cost you an additional $11 per month, while Fox Soccer Plus will set you back an additional $15 per billing cycle. That being said, purchasing the Showtime network gives you access to all 7 of their channels, including Showtime West, East, 2, Showcase, Extreme, Beyond, Next, and Woman. Fox Soccer Plus will only give you access to that 1 channel, but if you’re a die-hard soccer fan, you might be someone who is willing to pay that price. There are quite a few sports channels available on YouTube TV as well, meaning you will probably be able to watch football, soccer, basketball, or whatever other sport you follow on the regular. Considering a number of people have cable subscriptions just for Friday night football, this would be another great reason for people to finally get rid of their hard-wired cable subscriptions for good. One gripe we have with the content on YouTube TV is that we are limited to 720p as a maximum resolution. Our own Joshua Vergara wanted to mention that he was disappointed at the lack of HBO on YouTube TV, but considering HBO has pulled a number of fans over to its HBO GO and HBO NOW streaming services over the past couple of years, it might make sense that they would want to keep those services contained. These apps do have their own dedicated Chromecast-enabled streaming apps however, so I feel as thought it may have been a smart move for the company to enable sign-in through YouTube TV to be able to access that content. One other gripe I have with the content on YouTube TV is that everything included on the service, save the native YouTube Red content, is limited to 720p as a maximum resolution. While I understand the reasoning for this, we are entering an age where 4k is becoming the standard in what flat screen TVs can output. Live broadcast TV does usually only broadcast at 720p, so while it is understandable that that content would output at that resolution, it would be nice to see the selection of movies be available at at least 1080p. Google likely doesn’t offer this in order to refrain from cannibalizing Google Play Movies, but that is a whole separate conversation within itself. Funny enough, YouTube Red originals stream on the service up to 1440p, which does make sense considering the service offers that on YouTube itself. All in all, the 720 issue is really a gripe with the cable companies, not Google, so I won’t take this as too much of a con. Usability There are both great things and awkward things about the usability of Google’s new service. YouTube TV was clearly made to help bridge the gap between 2 technologies that can offer essentially the same service via different technology, and while this seems like a neat idea in theory, one could argue that live TV and streaming services are largely separated by the generational gap of users that are viewing them. Go ahead and call me out if you think I’m in the wrong here, but in my opinion those who would know enough about YouTube and streaming services to actually want to pay for YouTube TV are largely the type of people who rely almost solely on YouTube and other “instant gratification” services like Netflix to watch their content. Sure, live TV is great for those who are interested in watching new content as it airs, but often those who watch content online want the ability to watch anything at any time. This works out well for the “internet-savvy” crowd who can watch both existing and recorded content as well as live TV, but I feel that those who are most invested in live TV are not even going to know or care that YouTube TV exists. If Google is going to at all appeal to the middle aged to older generation, it is absolutely crucial that the app is as easy as possible to use. I feel that Google has absolutely nailed it in this respect. In this way I feel that Google only has the opportunity to access half of their market, which may or may not be enough to be successful. It was pointed out to me that 100 million households still had premium cable television as of 2014, and while many users probably still get loads of content from their cable providers, I would wager that  this number is dropping relatively rapidly. Again, I could be completely wrong about this, but it does feel a bit as though Google is attempting to sell an old service to a new generation. It will be hard to tell just how successful the service is until it has spread to a much larger portion of the country that is not quite as urbanized as the major metropolitan areas that Google has chosen for initial launch. Another thing I found annoying was the inclusion of ads in the service. These aren’t regular TV ads either, they are full on YouTube-style ads. In my opinion, if you are paying monthly for a service you should not have to be served ads, especially in addition to the advertising already built into cable TV. I understand that services like Hulu Plus still require users to watch advertising at a certain pricing tier, but it still seems like you are being screwed over if you are paying for a premium service and still seeing advertising. The point of YouTube Red is to remove ads and still be able to pay the content creators, and the same should be applied to YouTube TV, especially when you are paying what many would consider a relatively hefty (at least for an online subscription service) $35 per month. However, one thing I do love  is the ability to watch your content and live TV wherever you are as long as you are signed into your Google account. This service doesn’t require any additional hardware like a Roku player, you can just launch the app on your device and get to watching. One could even argue that this service alone could justify owning a tablet. While phones are generally now large enough to view content to a reasonable degree, having this app on your tablet essentially makes it a very portable live TV device, which adds a lot to its usability. In terms of the sheer ability to watch live TV at any time, YouTube TV easily pulls ahead of many other services available on the market. You can also record to a “Cloud DVR” if there is a show coming up that you won’t be able to view upon airing. These recordings last for 9 months, meaning you’ll have the ability to view your favorite shows whenever you like after they air. Since this recording is completely stored in the cloud, you’ll have a variety of options regarding where you can watch this content, whether it be your computer, your phone, or streamed to a dedicated TV. There is no content limit on what you record, so you could theoretically let the system back up every single show on the network if you’re that hardcore. Physical DVR boxes used to have very limited space, so having unlimited cloud backup enables you to catch any episode any time after it airs. Pretty freaking cool. Other thoughts.. Availability YouTube TV is currently only available in 5 select markets, including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco Bay Area, Chicago, and Philadelphia. While the company has said more markets are coming in the future, they did not provide any details regarding a time-frame for this. This peeved quite a few people, including our own Joe Hindy, who had quite a few words to say about the launch this past week. If you want to listen to his thoughts as well as those of a couple of our other team members, make sure you check out episode 103 of the Android Authority podcast, where we talked about YouTube TV quite extensively. It also should be noted that even if you sign up for the service in one of those markets, you can’t take it with you to regions that don’t offer access. So if you were hoping to travel with your YouTube TV subscription across the country, you’re out of luck. Simplicity Something I am quite a fan of, and I think is pretty crucial to the success of this application and service, is its ease of use. The fact that you can open the app and jump directly into live TV or search for your favorite channels or shows is great, and Google has even omitted its classic “Hamburger” style expandable menu, since there are essentially no extra options you would need to use to tweak the app. If Google is going to at all appeal to the middle aged to older generation that are used to relying on their cable provider for most of their content, it is absolutely crucial that the app is as easy as possible to use, and I feel that Google has absolutely nailed it in this respect. “Pausing” live TV If you need to get up and stop watching your show while it’s airing, Google will automatically record the rest of the show so that you can “continue watching” at any time. This is a fantastic feature, as it allows for much better usability and convenience that it is impossible to get with a traditional cable subscription. Though Comcast and other wired connections have added internet streaming options for shows as well, the ability to get the service wholly separately and have everything rout through your Google account is something I am personally in love with, and hope that other people can see the benefits of this implementation. Verdict YouTube TV is a bold venture by Google to upgrade a traditional service for use in the modern world. Taking your favorite content with you wherever you are and being able to watch shows live from anywhere is a service that many would likely be willing to pay a steep price for, but $35 may seem a bit too far for those who don’t care as much about live TV and are more worried about getting any episode at any time. The extremely limited availability of the service is a nuisance at the time of writing, but will hopefully be expanded much, much more widely in the near future. Though I did not notice any significant bugs in the service at the time of launch, the ones that do exist will likely be ironed out once the service hits more markets in the future. It’s hard to say how YouTube TV will fare in a booming market that has seen increased competition recently in the form of Direct TV Now, SlingTV, Playstation Vue, and even an upcoming TV service from Hulu. That said, we’re excited to see how it all unfolds. What’s your opinion of YouTube TV? Can you even use the service? Would you pay $35 a month for it? Let us know in the comments below.

ITSHOW 2017 Search for: Home > Google > Try Out Google Tango And Visit The National Museum Right Now GoogleNewsSmartphonesVirtual Reality Try Out Google Tango And Visit The National Museum Right Now Thomas Oliver April 13, 2017April 13, 20170434 The National Museum of Singapore is worth the visit no matter what time of year. However, now is as good a time as any with their latest endeavour. Teaming up with  Google and app creator GuidiGo, you can explore the museum with AR. Not all of it mind, this is still a trial version of the software. However, if it garners a good amount of consumer interest it might well go. Naturally, VR Zone went down to check out the technology for ourselves. It’s not perfect, but it is definitely a fun experience and one of the best consumer level AR tours we’ve experienced. Explore with Tango Image courtesy: National Museum of Singapore Google’s Tango is a specially designed software and hardware made to enhance AR applications on Android devices. How it manages to do that has been explored in a previous article when we had a hands-on experience in Shanghai last July. There we were shown the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first phone to use Tango. This is important to note because guess what devices we were handed to explore the museum with? It was essentially a bunch of smartphones attached to lanyards to prevent any damage by butter-fingered morons like yours truly. With 200 of these phones ready to be used, let’s hope that they are safely stowed away when not in use. Image courtesy: GuidiGo The tour itself was a great deal of fun. Part of the app functions like a map to direct you to points of interest. The part where Tango comes into its own however is when you can explore the virtual world while looking at the physical. From being able to walk around a scale model of the museum, even scaling the timeline to see how it looked when originally built, to seeing the famous Whale skeleton that has since been moved. We were only shown four points of interest out of the overall six. Guest can expect the AR tour to last around one hour. While you need to register, it’s completely free. Image courtesy: GuidiGo However, it is far from perfect. The setup time can take a while for it torecognise that you want to start your tour. Even worse, at certain points, the GPS completely failed and I was stuck with a loading screen. I knew how to fix it, but there were other journalists who needed constant help from staff. Furthermore, although you are using a smartphone, you can’t take screenshots. You can’t even take selfies with the AR overlay, which will be a serious concern for some museum goes. Image courtesy: GuidiGo Nonetheless, it’s an excellent use of AR technology and should be a definite draw for the museum. If it goes well, we might see other institutions in Singapore start giving it a serious look. Whether this means that AR catches on as a consumer product is another question entirely, however. It all depends on how well the Asus Zenfone AR fares when it launches later this year.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « LG may announce in June whether they've decided to Enter Apple's OLED Supply Chain as Requested | Main | A Federal Appeals Court Upheld a Jury Verdict for Apple in a case brought by Conversant » April 17, 2017 Russian Court Approves the Government's Deal with Google over Android Monopoly Case   Last month Patently Apple posted a report titled "Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service Finds Apple Guilty of Price-Fixing." Today Google's Android is in the spotlight in Russia. it's being reported that Russian anti-monopoly watchdog FAS and Alphabet Inc's Google have reached an out-of-court settlement in a dispute over the tech giant's Android operating system, FAS said on Monday.   Alexei Dotsenko, FAS deputy head, told reporters that "Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications."   The TASS Russian News Agency added that "The Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) and US Corporation Google are planning to announce the results of negotiations on a settlement agreement regarding the company abusing its dominant position in the Russian market of mobile application stores on the Android operating system (owned by Google).   On September 14, 2015 the Federal Antimonopoly Service recognized Google Inc. and Google Ireland Ltd. as having breached the competition protection law under the complaint of the Russian Internet company Yandex.   According to the regulator, Google obliged manufacturers of Android OS-based devices to pre-install its applications together with Android platform. FAS said that Google's policy restricted installation of applications by other developers. Google did not agree with the ruling and appealed to the court.   On September 29, Google started to notify Russian users of the Android devices about the possibility of changing the search engine, deactivating pre-installed applications, installing third-party services (including third-party search engines and widgets, email, calendar, and other services) and changing position of application icons. Google noted it continues to work with FAS on technical execution of their orders.   FAS also imposed the fine for abuse of market dominating position in the amount of 438 mln rubles (US$7.8 mln). The amount of the fine consists of 9% of company's turnover on the Russian market in 2014 plus inflation.   In Reuters report on this story today they've added that "As part of the agreement, Google will also develop a tool allowing users to choose a default search engine on their Android devices.   The deal was approved by a Russian court earlier on Monday, Dotsenko said, adding that it was for a term of six years and nine months."   If FAS has made Google bend on their platform, could Apple's iOS be next?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Users are experiencing problems including bootloops and major battery issues. Google is allegedly offering no support. The claims began when Google released Android 7.0 Nougat to the Nexus 6P. Some owners found their phones stuck in a bootloop, continually restarting with no way to suspend the behaviour. There is no method that readily recovers the phone from the loop, leaving devices unusable. The second, unrelated issue, sees the battery randomly shutdown during use. The phone's charger has to be connected before the phone will restart. While operational, the battery reading may change erratically, ranging from between 10 to 60 percent. Huawei has placed responsibility firmly onto Google, insisting it's an issue with Android 7.0 rather than a hardware defect. Google is also refusing to do anything about the issues. While it has acknowledged the battery complaints, the company's issue tracker ranks the issue as "low priority," signalling there's no hope of a patch or official solution arriving anytime soon. It hasn't addressed the more serious bootlooping which renders phones completely unusable. This leaves owners in an awkward situation. With useless devices and the companies behind the phone blaming each other, the situation isn't progressing. Making matters worse for Google, the LG-built Nexus 5X is already the subject of a class action lawsuit, again due to bootlooping problems. A law firm is now planning a similar motion for the Nexus 6P, Android Police reports. With neither Google or Huawei offering any support to their customers, Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is stepping up to the table to force the tech giants into action. The law company is investigating whether it can act on the behalf of Nexus 6P owners to file a suit against Google. If Google continues to side-step customer complaints, it could end up hindering its larger smartphone ambitions. With the Nexus line now discontinued and the company's built-in-house Pixel taking centre-stage, the company needs quality customer service if it's to succeed in the industry. It has also been lacking with this device though, forcing customers through returns processes to sort out issues. It still lacks the inventory to easily replace defective units. With Pixel billed as a rival to the iPhone, Google wants people to take its smartphones seriously. However, with class action lawsuits piling up and customer service lacking, the company's inexperience in the industry is painfully evident. Google will need to rethink its strategy before this fall's Pixel 2 launch if it's to convince its unsettled customers it's capable of selling phones at scale.

Advertisement Shockingly not a single one comes from Adobe. The company has optimized all of its mobile apps for Chrome OS, but they still feel unmistakably like mobile apps—not desktop ones. The seven apps you’ll find on this list actually feel like they belong in a world of keyboards and trackpads. 1) Quik Image: Screenshot Online apps can do a decent job in most situations, but one area where they definitely lag behind their video counterparts is in video editing. While most Chromebooks won’t have the grunt for serious video editing work, a lightweight app like Quik can do wonders for some quick and dirty cutting. We wouldn’t suggest it for piecing together a short film, but it’s perfect if you just want to cut footage of the kids and send it to friends and family. Advertisement It’s one of our favorite picks for editing on mobile devices, and it looks great on a Chromebook too. Now owned and developed by GoPro, Quik doesn’t just let you do simple cuts, it also allows you to add music, choose filters, and even overlay some really cool text onto your videos. It’s not the most advanced app out there, but the results are impressive enough that you might not miss iMovie. Quik (free) 2) Instagram Image: Screenshot This is one instance where having a Chromebook definitely beats having a computer running Windows or MacOS. Instagram is available on the web, but in a cut-down, half-baked form, so get the Android version loaded up on your Chromebook: you can import and upload files from just about anywhere, scroll through your feed, view the new Stories format, and so on and so on. Plus, having that Chromebook keyboard makes it easier to message people and tap out those witty comments. The app hasn’t been fully optimized for Chrome OS just yet (it still lives in a square box), but it’s still fully functional and easy to operate from your laptop. Sponsored Instagram (free) 3) Dropbox Paper Image: Screenshot Google and Microsoft have capable online office suites you can use on your Chromebook, but the Android versions of Word, Excel and PowerPoint aren’t currently compatible with the best of the current batch of Android-enabled Chromebooks and sometimes it’s nice to get away from the all seeing eye of Google. To plug the processor gap, try Dropbox Paper. Advertisement Improved offline support is one reason to go for this app over the online alternatives, and in general it’s a cleaner, more capable take on the old word processor idea. The interface works fine on a larger screen, and your keyboard and trackpad should work flawlessly too. Dropbox Paper (free) 4) Spotify Image: Screenshot File this one under “instances where the Android app is better than the web version”, which is fairly obvious when you think about it. Spotify’s web player is fine and everything, but the Android version is better, and as a bonus it even looks good on a big screen. On top of that you can cache playlists for offline listening of course, so you’ve got something to rock out to when your internet goes down or you’re stuck on a train. With the magic of Spotify Connect you can beam tunes to other hardware from Chrome OS. Advertisement Spotify (free) 5) Firefox Chrome OS is essentially just Chrome, which makes it kind of tricky to install another browser. But sometimes you don’t want Google knowing your every online move. If you like the appealing price tag of Chromebooks, but aren’t crazy about using Google for every single thing on your computer then download Firefox for Android. It gives you an alternative browser (albeit in a form optimized for mobile), complete with desktop syncing capabilities. That means if you use Firefox on another computer you can sync all of your stuff straight to your Chromebook. Firefox for Android also comes with plenty of other features to make use of, including smart searches, an intuitive tab system, and a huge library of add-ons. Advertisement Advertisement Firefox (free) 6) Alto’s Adventure Image: Screenshot Another area where Android apps are streets ahead of web apps is gaming, and we could’ve picked almost any game here. We’ve gone for Alto’s Adventure as it looks gorgeous in landscape mode, and is compatible with trackpads (so the screen stays unobstructed). It’s also just a great endless runner-style game. If you’re new to the world of Alto’s Adventure, the idea is to last as long as you can on a downhill snowboard run, picking up points for catching llamas, performing tricks, and escaping Elders on the mountain. Advertisement Alto’s Adventure (free) 7) Gmail Image: Screenshot Yes, yes, yes, you can access Gmail through your web browser—but the Android app looks particularly elegant on larger screens, and comes with a few tricks the web interface doesn’t have, including customizable alerts you can switch on and off for individual labels. The Android app also handles multiple Google accounts better than the web version does, and the interface is a little bit neater too. What’s more, you can swipe messages to plough through them more quickly, using your Chromebook’s touchscreen or built-in trackpad.

By: Bloomberg | Published: April 17, 2017 10:08 PM Google had been appealing the ruling prior to the settlement. (Reuters) Alphabet Inc.’s Google settled its dispute with Russia’s antitrust watchdog in an agreement that opens the way for local search engine Yandex NV to be pre-installed on Android devices. Google will unbundle its services from its Android operating system in Russia and pay a fine of 438 million rubles ($7.8 million) under the settlement reached with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, Aleksey Dotsenko, the regulator’s deputy head, told reporters on Monday. Google will allow Android phone makers to pre-install third-party services such as Yandex, including on the first screen, as part of the agreement approved by Moscow District Arbitration Court, Dotsenko said. The regulator ruled in October 2015 that Google violated anti-monopoly rules and should change agreements with mobile-device makers to allow them to pre-install third-party services. Google had been appealing the ruling prior to the settlement. Yandex shares in New York jumped after the announcement and were 5.1 percent higher at $23.92 at 4:48 p.m. in Moscow. The company has about 55 percent market share in Russian search versus Google’s 40 percent, according to researcher LiveInternet. Its share is about 38 percent on Google’s Android, according to Yandex. Watch this also: Yandex Chief Executive Officer Arkady Volozh compared the decision to Microsoft unbundling Internet Explorer from Windows in 2009. It should enable Yandex to reach commercial agreements with mobile-phone makers and expand its share of search on Android devices in Russia, he said. The FAS settlement and a separate commercial agreement with Yandex meet the interests of all parties and provide “additional opportunities to promote the Yandex search service in the Chrome browser,” Google said in a statement on its website. Yandex’s share of the Russian search market has been declining on devices powered by Android. It won an antitrust case in Russia and filed a similar case in the European Union, joining complaints by Microsoft Corp.-backed FairSearch lobby group, ad-blocker Disconnect and independent applications-store Aptoide.

By Aman Jain on April 17, 2017 11:10 am in Technology ShareTweetPostFlip Google has another big project in its enterprise and cloud division: Google Hire. The latest project, which is being led by Diane Greene, is reportedly a job applicant tracking system which appears to compete with services like Lever and Greenhouse, according to Axios. WDnetStudio / Pixabay Will Google give your search history to employers? Axios reader Colin Heilbut spotted some job listing links which indicate that Google Hire allows employers to post job listings and then accept and manage applications. And there is reportedly one more thing that this service may help employers with – your search history. This could very helpful for employers, as almost all now do a web search about an applicant before calling them for an interview. This recruitment tool will be similar to LinkedIn, but earlier reports suggested that the service would be available through users’ personal Google accounts. If those earlier reports are true, then the service will link things like users’ YouTube accounts and search history with their job applications, according to The Sun. This would allow employers to learn a lot about applicants, potentially including some things the law bars them from asking applicants about during the hiring process. The tool is currently in testing, as the service has not been officially announced yet. The login page is live, but it is not possible to check the website. When one tries to sign in, it gives an error message saying that the Gmail ID that was entered is not associated with an account. This service could have some connection with the acquisition of Bebop, a startup founded by Diane Greene that Google acquired in 2015. Many technology companies are either testing or using the service, including CoreOS (a specialized Linux distribution developer), Medisas (a medical software company), SingleHop (an IT services management outfit), Poynt (a payment platform), and DramaFever (a video streaming website owned by Warner Brothers). How Google Hire works This latest project will place the tech company in the online job board business. A listing posted by Medisas gives some hints about the features available for posting jobs, according to AndroidHeadlines. The job listing appears similar to one found on Google’s own website, with the position written in a vertical scrolling format. Job applicants are given an idea about what is required of them for the job, along with the prerequisites and preferred sets of qualifications and skills. The service asks for the user’s name and contact information. The employer posting the job can decide whether a cover letter or resume is required or not. Neither the internet giant nor any of its employees testing the service have revealed how it works or when it will be officially announced. It is also not clear what sort of searches Google Hire could do on potential job applicants. The service will most likely be an end-to-end applicant management solution, given its resemblance to Google’s own complete job portal and the listing content. To be on the safe side, be careful about what you are browsing for now.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Pinning Down Abuse On Google Maps Example of Google Fake Listing Washington DC (PRWEB) April 17, 2017 A research paper by the University of California titled, “Pinning Down Abuse On Google Maps,” funded by a grant of 4.97 million dollars from the National Science Foundation, documents the extent we are exposed to misinformation on the Internet. This information can be in the form of a false address, fake map points, untrue claims all which could mislead the consumer. Many unscrupulous companies use these illegal techniques to gain a prominent listing. False listings can totally fool a consumer as they entice the consumer by suggesting a nearby false location, cheap prices, and even mimicking an existing reputable well-known service. This can create many unhappy customers left with poor workmanship and high costs once this locksmith arrives. The other huge impact is loss of business of service calls diverted from honest locksmiths who abide by the guidelines created by the search engines. “In this paper, we investigate a new form of blackhat search engine optimization that targets local listing services like Google Maps. Miscreants register abusive business listings in an attempt to siphon search traffic away from legitimate businesses and funnel it to deceptive service industries—such as unaccredited locksmiths—or to traffic-referral scams, often for the restaurant and hotel industry.” “Users’ online attention is becoming increasingly localized: A recent Google study [1] reports that 4 out of 5 users conduct searches with local intent. A wide variety of local listing services like Apple and Google Maps, Yelp, and Foursquare have emerged to enable users to search for businesses based on physical location. Hence, relevance is no longer sufficient to drive interest; geographical proximity is the coin of the emerging localized-search realm.” “However, increasing economic incentives are driving an ecosystem of deceptive business practices that exploit-localized search, such as illegal locksmiths that extort victims into paying for inferior services [9]. In response, local listing services like Google Maps employ increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms to try and prevent fraudulent listings from appearing on their services.” The problem of identification So how do you avoid these scamming locksmith companies? They know how to disguise themselves as a legitimate business. Their web sites look professional, plus they gain a legitimacy provided by the search engines and online directories enhancements. Some are a prominent placement on their first page, a beautiful map listing and many times they allow a manufactured five star reviews to blend their listings with others perfectly. Remove the false listings. The locksmith trade accounts for 25% of all bad listings according to the study. “In collaboration with Google, we examined over a hundred-thousand business listings that appeared on Google Maps between June 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 that were subsequently suspended for abuse.” So it can be done. Search Engines and Online directories can remove the bad listings before they are seen. The search engines and online directories have a responsibility to validate listings before they place them as a resource for the consumer. They are a for profit organization (Google made approximately 55 Billion in revenue last year). So, one would think they would want their information to be accurate. Techniques to detect false listings Hire a real person(s) to validate listings. Do not use algorithms. They don’t work, but real people can analyze all problematic categories with no trouble. Are they registered with the state corporation commission and the state tax department? Are they truly licensed in the states that have locksmith licenses? You can check online at the state web sites. Check the address they say they are located – if they have no affiliation with that address. Do a reverse search see what appears at that address. Call the business or one next-door see if the address checks out that way. If not legit send their web page to the back pages and please don’t give them a pinpoint position on the map. Call the company directly. A quick trick to find out the truth call the locksmith: ask if you can come by and get a house key duplicated. If the response is something like „We’re a dispatch point,” they just might be a scammer as they definitely have no affiliation with that address; lie number one. Mobile locksmiths may have a service area but not an address if not true. What can the consumer do? Many times they can’t tell real from false. It’s not their fault. The listings are so well disguised there is no way to note a difference on first glance. The consumer can use the same methods as mentioned to check out the company to see if it is presenting false information, if found to be lying then there is a high probability good things will not follow. But you can try. It takes time and is difficult to do without resources as the search engine who placed them there to begin with. So be sure to suggest to your search engine they police their publication. It benefits all; the consumer, legit service companies, and the reputation and honor of the search engine. Good luck and let’s fix this problem together. Share article on social media or email: CategoriesUncategorized TagsUncategorized Post navigation Previous PostPrevious Digital Defense, Inc.

The only problem, of course, is that what Google deems as fake news, in many cases, is really just news that challenges the status quo narrative, suggesting that users will soon be unable to pull up any information on Google that isn’t officially sanctioned by the government as being legitimate. Google’s new “fact-checking” module is backed by none other than Snopes, a widely-popular disinformation gatekeeper that poses as an independent, bipartisan source for facts on a variety of issues. As it turns out, Snopes is nothing more than a special interest network of lies that works to keep a lid on anything that might expose the deep state agenda of the government and its mouthpieces in the mainstream media. Also onboard with Google’s new censorship scheme are many of the usual suspects like The Washington Post, Buzzfeed, and Salon, all of which have repeatedly exposed themselves as corrupt liars that obstruct the free flow of truthful information whenever they’re given the opportunity. This alliance of deceivers is reportedly working closely with Google to make sure that as little truth as possible gets out to the masses within the new module, which has already begun to work its magic in Google searches. According to The Daily Wire, Google’s rationale for aligning itself with these questionable entities to screen and censor search engine content is that they represent “authoritative sources,” even though every single one of them is a left-leaning peddler of misinformation. Nevertheless, Google wants the world to believe that these are independent fact-checking services, and that they are looking out for the best interests of the public. Google module attempting to hide truth about Hillary Clinton’s treasonous ties to Russia Ironically enough, one subject that Google doesn’t want its users to learn the truth about is that failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has some treasonous financial ties to Russia. When users conduct a search about the former Secretary of State’s approval of transferring 20 percent of U.S. uranium deposits to a company in Russia, they are met with an immediate denial of this truth. “When looking up, say, ‘Hillary Clinton sold uranium to Russia’ on Google, a small icon pops up at the bottom that, in this case [says], ‘fact check by Snopes.com: False,'” writes Joseph Curl for The Daily Wire. Google had earlier attempted to get this module up and running prior to the most recent presidential election, presumably to erode enough support for now-President Trump that his win might have been prevented. This effort ultimately failed, as the module didn’t work properly back then. But it’s now being ramped up in full force after extensive tweaking, which threatens to make it that much more difficult to pull up truthful information on Google. As reported by BBC News, Google will be informing users of the module’s presence with an advertisement that will appear at the top of users’ news feeds, instructing them on “how to spot fake news” and report it to the search engine. From there, the effort will cascade into the creation of a consensus-based user experience where only information deemed “true” by the “fact-checkers” and their user allies will turn up in Google search results. It’s the ultimate 1984 paradigm shift for Google, and another clear indicator as to the need for viable search engine alternatives like GoodGopher.com that don’t engage in such censorship tactics.

These are external links and will open in a new window Close share panel Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Google has struck a deal in Russia but is still fighting its case in the EU Google has promised to allow rivals' search engines and apps to be pre-installed on phones running its versions of Android in Russia. The concession follows an out-of-court deal with the country's competition watchdog. In addition, Google has promised to develop a tool to make it easy for users to change their device's default search engine. Shares in Google's local Russian rival, Yandex, rose more than 7% on the news. It brings to an end a long-running battle between the US firm and Russia's competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS). Google had argued the regulator had no case because manufacturers could develop their own versions of Android or pre-install other apps of their choice. But the FAS had argued that, despite its denials, Google was indeed "prohibiting" rival software to its own YouTube, Maps and Photos apps to be pre-installed alongside its own dominant version of Android. The agency became involved after Yandex filed a complaint in February 2015. Despite the nature of the settlement, Google will still have to pay a 438m rouble ($7.8; £6.2m) fine imposed after it failed to appeal the case last August. "We are happy to have reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with Russia's competition regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), resolving the competition case over the distribution of Google apps on Android," a spokeswoman for Google told the BBC. Yandex's chief executive Arkady Volozh declared the settlement "an important day for Russian consumers". "I am thankful to the Federal Antimonopoly Service for applying the law in a manner that effectively and efficiently restores competition to the market for the benefit of Russian users, as competition always breeds innovation," he added. The EU continues to pursue similar claims against Google, saying the firm is "requiring and incentivising" Android hardware manufacturers to exclusively use its services.

REUTERS/Sergei KarpukhinMore MOSCOW (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's Google will open up its popular Android mobile operating system to rival search engines in Russia as part of a deal to settle a two-year dispute with Russian competition authorities. The deal sets a new precedent for the tech giant, which faces multiple complaints worldwide that it is abusing its dominant position by imposing restrictions on manufacturers of Android-based devices in order to protect its share of the online search market. Russia's competition watchdog, FAS, ruled in 2015 that Google was breaking the law by requiring the pre-installation of applications, including its own search tool, on mobile devices using Android, following a complaint by Russia's Yandex. Google will no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia and will not restrict the pre-installation of rival search engines and other applications, as part of a deal with FAS, the regulator said on Monday. It will also develop a tool allowing users to choose a default search engine on their Android devices. "Users will be able to change settings at any time and choose the default search engine which suits their needs," FAS said. Google confirmed the deal, saying it met the interests of all parties. It also said it had reached a commercial agreement with Yandex that "provides new opportunities for Yandex to promote its search service within Chrome (internet browser)." Alexander Shulgin, head of Yandex Russian operations, said he hoped the agreement will have implications for similar cases in Europe and elsewhere. Nasdaq-listed shares in Yandex were up 7.2 percent by 1534 GMT to $24.39 while Google was up 1.2 percent. The deal is for a term of six years and nine months and was approved by a Russian court earlier on Monday. Under the terms of the agreement, Google will still have to pay a total of 439 million roubles ($7.85 million) in fines.

Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up Google “will be obliged not to restrict pre-installation of any competing search engines and applications” on its Android operating system in Russia, the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service said on its website on Monday. The company will pay a fine of 438 million rubles ($7.8 million) and allow Android phone makers to pre-install third-party services such as Yandex, including on the first screen, as part of the settlement approved by Moscow District Arbitration Court, Aleksey Dotsenko, the antitrust regulator’s deputy head, told reporters. Google will “no longer demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia,” the FAS said. The settlement with the regulator and a separate commercial agreement with Yandex meet the interests of all parties and provide “additional opportunities to promote the Yandex search service in the Chrome browser,” Google said in a website statement. The regulator ruled in October 2015 that Google violated anti-monopoly rules and should change agreements with mobile-device makers to allow them to pre-install third-party services. Google had been appealing the ruling prior to the settlement. Google will develop an active “choice window” for the Chrome browser for devices currently on the market, so that users can choose their default search engine when they next update their system, according to the FAS’s statement. It will develop a Chrome widget for new devices within a few months to allow users to choose their preferred search engine on first use. Yandex shares in New York jumped after the announcement and were 7 percent higher at $24.35 at 7:13 p.m. in Moscow. The company has about 55 percent market share in Russian search versus Google’s 40 percent, according to researcher LiveInternet. Its share is about 38 percent on Google’s Android, according to Yandex. Yandex Chief Executive Officer Arkady Volozh compared the decision to Microsoft unbundling Internet Explorer from Windows in 2009. It should enable Yandex to reach commercial agreements with mobile-phone makers and expand its share of search on Android devices in Russia, he said. Yandex’s share of the Russian search market has been declining on devices powered by Android. It won an antitrust case in Russia and filed a similar case in the European Union, joining complaints by Microsoft Corp.-backed FairSearch lobby group, ad-blocker Disconnect and independent applications-store Aptoide.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 133 Plus 1 on G+ 294 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares508 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Home News Companies Mobile Gadgets Opinion Cyber Security Multimedia Fin24 TechCompanies Russia fines Google over R100m as part of competition deal 2017-04-17 18:19 - Ilya Khrennikov, Bloomberg Post a comment 0 share: Google’s headquarters in Mountain View. (Marcio Jose Sanchez, AP, File) RELATED ARTICLES Google Maps moves Presidency Office after Saxonwold listing Google's AlphaGo AI takes on China Uber fires back at Google spinoff in self-driving car case Moscow - Alphabet’s Google settled its dispute with Russia’s antitrust watchdog in an agreement that opens the way for local search engine Yandex to be pre-installed on Android devices. Google will unbundle its services from its Android operating system in Russia and pay a fine of 438 million rubles (R104m) under the settlement reached with the Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, Aleksey Dotsenko, the regulator’s deputy head, told reporters on Monday. Google will allow Android phone makers to pre-install third-party services such as Yandex, including on the first screen, as part of the agreement approved by Moscow District Arbitration Court, Dotsenko said. The regulator ruled in October 2015 that Google violated anti-monopoly rules and should change agreements with mobile-device makers to allow them to pre-install third-party services. Google had been appealing the ruling prior to the settlement. Yandex shares in New York jumped after the announcement and were 5.1% higher at $23.92 at 16:48 in Moscow. The company has about 55% market share in Russian search versus Google’s 40%, according to researcher LiveInternet. Its share is about 38% on Google’s Android, according to Yandex. Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh compared the decision to Microsoft unbundling Internet Explorer from Windows in 2009. It should enable Yandex to reach commercial agreements with mobile-phone makers and expand its share of search on Android devices in Russia, he said. The FAS settlement and a separate commercial agreement with Yandex meet the interests of all parties and provide “additional opportunities to promote the Yandex search service in the Chrome browser,” Google said in a statement on its website. Yandex’s share of the Russian search market has been declining on devices powered by Android. It won an antitrust case in Russia and filed a similar case in the European Union, joining complaints by Microsoft-backed FairSearch lobby group, ad-blocker Disconnect and independent applications-store Aptoide.

[Update: Google resolves endless OTA loop] Google is updating Nexus 6P beta testers to the final 7.1.2 build [OTA Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 6:00pm PDTApr 12, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 126 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares286 Device Updates Downloads Google News Nexus 6P Nexus Devices Nougat 7.0/7.1 Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs Google's Android beta program allows the more intrepid among you to take a first crack at new updates, but it can be a little irksome to then move to the final build. For example, the 7.1.2 testers are still running the beta while the final version has rolled out to non-testers. Now, it looks like Google has started updating the beta build to final, but only for the Nexus 6P so far. The update clocks in at a mere 25.4MB, which isn't surprising. You're only going from 7.1.2 to a slightly different 7.1.2. The build number when all's said and done will be N2G47H. That's the same build that rolled out to non-testers. There should not be any feature differences between the two versions, but being on the right build means you'll be able to get OTA updates going forward. We don't yet know if this is rolling out to everyone, but check your update menu to be safe. If it's not there, we've got the URL of the OTA on Google's servers. Feel free to sideload it if you can't wait, but remember this is only for the 6P. Hopefully other devices on the beta get updates soon. Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs We got numerous reports earlier than phones were being offered another update to the beta build after installing the final one. Google neglected to flip some switch on its end to prevent phones from getting the beta OTA again, but that should be fixed now.

Brian Langlois I got this update. then promptly got the notification that the system update NPG47I was available. Installed that.

At least it did for me. Lol. James Brown What do you mean by "reset the phone." I have rebooted and gone into settings/system updates but I still get the prompt to download the previous version. Brianna D Green I rebooted after the new update and then once back in the phone, went to the update screen and notification disappeared after hitting check for update. James Brown Didn't work for me. Minty Yeah I think it's happening to everyone. I just let it put me back on to stable again and then unenrolled from the beta program so I would stop getting them. T4rd It's times like this when I'm glad I'm just on Pure Nexus ROM. =p Vedang Jadhav This is new loop man, If you are not getting bootloop, Google is ensuring you atleast get this loop!! danthepotato Thank god I'm not the only one... I tried using the chat help on the settings. The guy basically told me I should opt out of beta, but I don't want to wipe my phone...

Chisel I'm also getting the NPG47I «--» N2G47H loop. Weird. phineasjw Yep. Same thing. Took the opportunity to leave the Beta program. Just make sure you leave when running N2G47H. tonyc That's the same thing that keeps happening to me. Garry I just cleared the app data for Google Play Services and so far that has alleviated the problem. Artem Russakovskii Google fixed the endless loop, guys. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/6504su/anyone_else_get_a_stable_712_update_then/dg6oj2l/.

I just got the stable 7.1.2 but still no assistant. Services apps is up to date but nothing still. Wht shd i do? Carson Saldanha Is your Google app on English (US)? K9 Yes it is Carson Saldanha rip idk lol rasty++ stop ota please ..8 ota in 2 hours.. -.- Kyle Smith Got this on Nexus Player also, I like the new update animation and loading bar Ernie If you update to N2G47H and you are on the beta program. You will have to unenroll from the beta. rmagruder Just spotted this and unenrolled from the beta and annoying update message went away. Guess I'll stay out of the beta until they actually push out the next beta. 2 Men-E ...sooooo...after the comments, and selecting "Download", but before selecting "Install"...I shouldn't complete the update to this "final" 7.1.2 build [being that my 6P will just do OTA loops] 🤔 rmagruder Good LORD, Google. I just got this on my 6P. It updated the phone, and after rebooting with the final 7.1.2, it promptly gave me a new System update available message wanting to install a beta version of 7.1.2 (HPG47I) at a hefty cost of 1313.6Mb. What the heck? That was what I was JUST ON before getting the FINAL OTA. George Hadjidakis Just opt out from the beta program then back in and then out again and it will go.. Bruno Montini To everyone getting the update prompt again and again, clear cache partition, it fixed it for me I also left the beta before clearing cache Lateef Alabi-Oki If you "Check For Update" on the Nexus 5x you might get it too. I got it that way. Tim Meader Once you have the official update (installed) and have booted back up... just IGNORE the prompt to update back to the beta version. Go into the Beta Program settings and leave the program. Problem solved. F4LL0U7 I'm not looking to factory reset OR leave the beta program though... I'd imagine they have to fix this if so many people are getting it, right? Tim Meader There's no need to be in the beta program right now since there's no actual beta. You can easily go back to it at any time via the same method, that's not an issue. It takes 5 seconds to sign back up. As I said, if you've already installed the release update and rebooted, leaving the beta won't factory reset anything. F4LL0U7 Oh cool, I didn't realize you could opt out without wiping once you were on stable. Thanks! Razed Does this address the 6P battery issues? F4LL0U7 I just got updated to the final 7.1.2 build on my Nexus 5X (N2G47F). Same thing, around 25MB. And then a funny thing happened. I immediately was prompted to download and install the beta 2 (NPG47I). I am ignoring it for now, because I would imagine that installing that will knock me back to the pre-release version of 7.1.2, which I don't want. Anyone else getting this? TBBT+HIMYM The same thing with me. I should try to get out of beta probably. TBBT+HIMYM Yes. It works. F4LL0U7 But you probably had to wipe your phone when exiting the beta, right? TBBT+HIMYM No. Ignore the beta version message. Exit the beta and the message just disappears by itself. Wipe is not necessary. F4LL0U7 Awesome, thanks! danthepotato Opting out once you are on N2G47H solves the problem, without a pesky notification or need to wipe your phone Jacob Mcalister Tattoos I'm still on the beta on pixel xl.. anyone else like this? Anthony Castanza Small Pixel, still on beta, no OTA in sight. el_smurfo How do you have a 6P with the battery so low to update, yet it hasn't long since shut off prematurely at 30-40%? noneofthem Thanks, everybody. I was afraid to be the only one with that issue. I hope Google will find a solution to this fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google phone users are always bragging that they're the first to get updates. Now Google has taken it to the next level. Google phone users are the first to get into a continuous, never-ending update loop. Callanish Pure hyperbolic bullshit. There never was a never-ending update loop. All anyone had to do was pay attention to what was going on with the updates and have an incline of knowledge about what it means to be enrolled in the beta program. They'd have seen that the patch was upgrading them to the stable 7.1.2 release. They would have then seen, after rebooting, that there was a glitch with a beta installation trying to get them to install itself over a stable version. Beta 101 enrollment and research would have told them that if they were on a stable version, unenrolling from the beta program would not delete their data and any notification asking them to revert back to a beta version would be gone once unenrolled. That would have eliminated something easily solveable and have avoided giving someone like you a smug 'sky is falling' response making it seem like all this was a big deal. If you're going to be a guinea pig, by running a beta version on a phone, you've got to take some responsibility when things go pear shape and at least use common sense and learn the basics of being part of the beta program beforehand so you can at least recognize when, in this case, the user is causing the loop themselves by continuously downloading whatever the Google Notification is telling them to download and not paying attention to the fact that they are installing a beta version over a stable version creating this self inflicted problem. Charlie I have the same issue. I was confused a bit too. But I think what is going on is the final build date is after the beta 2 build date. So to the system it looks like your not on the latest build. That is why we could not side load the OTA without opting out of beta program because if your on beta 2 it looks like your on the latest build. I don't know why they do that but this is not the first time it has happened. Usually they fix the issue before the OTA is sent out so we don't get the notification for the beta build though. Lucas Cannon 5X as well, received an update stating it would be build N2G47H, then after reboot says build N2G47F. Andre Laurence I just got the final version update. It was a flawless install. FCEEVIPER I installed the OTA NPG47I, then I turned away from my phone and saw the phone was asking for a restartinstall but I did not notice that the restart would be installing NPG471. Maybe I should be paying more attention. : Should I opt out of beta to get the stable build? I'm confused. Erroneus When you have the final version installed (N2G47H), opt out of the beta program. That solves it. KosmoCrisis Me too. Nexus 6p on Project Fi, no different. This type of loop is not fun. onekage Thought it was strange to receive a beta update after receiving the​ final version I had been waiting for, for over a week. Let's hope battery life is a little better... But with a 25mb update I don't have much hope. Hopefully they do something cool with O. BBpost As someone mentioned below, I cleared out the cache for Google Play Services while on N2G47H and rebooted. This fixed the constant update cycle bug. Alvin persaud Install the "h" update first then "I" update (large)when it prompts u back to update to "h" just restart the phone and it should be good to go. Dan Zunko Nexus 5x just got the update. No loop so far. M.R. Betz 5X is up too. N2G47F for my 5X. jdawg0024 Google is also updating the Nexus 5x beta to final as well. I got the update just an hour ago TheDrunkenClam I have tried three times to install this OTA using Flashfire and cannot for the life of me get it to work. Flashfire detects it just fine, but once it fails, I don't know where the OTA resides after it is downloaded so I cannot find where it is to get it to try again (Flashfire doesn't automatically see it on the second attempt after that initial attempt for some reason). So I have been opting out of beta and then back in for it to re download the OTA and thus have Flashfire recognize. 1. Where does the OTA resides after it's downloaded? 2. Any settings in Flashfire that I should look for? idna As far as I can remember, the OTA resides in /data/ota_package (N5X, but it should be the same). And FlashFire can detect it if it's there. But in the past I noticed another location (complicated path, don't remember it now) had been used and indeed, it was not visible for FlashFire - and when I pointed the program to this location it didn't detect anything. What I would recommend is to simply grab the 7.1.2 factory image, opt out of the beta program and simply write this (factory) image with FlashFire, of course without overwriting the userdata partition. That's what I did when the images where released some weeks ago, I couldn't wait for Google to push this special OTA for those of us using the beta program. lomsha The notification finally went away on O. Margaritas Ante Porcos Nexus 6p owners, don't rush to update. My 6p's battery dies within few moments after I've updated from 7.1.1. to 7.1.2. You know how Google reacts to this. Google ignores anything. Morenicano In celebration of fixing the update loop, Google has decided to make another message app F4LL0U7 This one will have a built-in shopping list, but users will only be able to access it via Google Glass. Morenicano ...and the Nexus Q 2 Men-E For some reason my 6P is no longer receiving this final OTA. I downloaded it early today, but did not install it. Since then, I rebooted my 6P, and the install notification went away, and now when I check for updates, nothing is there. Scott Stekel I'm in the same boat. Was offered the OTA, but wasn't in a position to do it right then. I "snoozed" the notication but it hasn't been offered again for five days or so. Have you received it yet? AnthonyRyan89 I got the final build update today and updated it then an hour later I got another update for the beta again. Curt Left the beta now. Leeroy Jenkins Feels good to be a pixel user ;) oneyedmonkey Feels good to be a P̶i̶x̶e̶l̶ Nexus user ;) iboalali I got this update got my Nexus 5x yesterday sebastianer This is good. With the 5X after the previous beta, they took more than a month to release the OTA from Beta to Stable. Now only just a week. But from M to N...they released the stable OTA asap, maybe even before the official OTA. and that was even better. Rob Paek I hope this fixes the app crashing I've had lately Keith Boykin I'm stuck on NP47I and it keeps saying it is up to date. Guess I'll have to remove from beta and then re-enroll Marty Wait...Isn't "I" after "H"? Mine shows NPG47I. Why would an "update" be named in a retroactive manner? mrjayviper Goggle with all the feels on its payroll can't solve/perfect OTA updates Wy Elkins Happened on my Nexus 5X yesterday. Finally settled down. Got the April Security update this morning. PP Well... Battery life is better... Less laggy, but cashes more app, now freeze instead of lagging, system UI crashes all the time . Heat problem is not solved. It's not heat as much as my G3 but you see it's taking a great toll on fluidity and stability. If I put it on a ice pack, it's almost instantaneous the gain of speed and fluidity witch lead me to find out that body temperature is bit too hot but room temperature is blazing fast.... I think I found the 801 and 810 heat problem.... They messed up with the temperature target for best operation at the semiconductor plant... It should be body temperature and bit up not room.....

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Mobile Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL Start Having Problems After The Android 7.1.2 Update By Catalina Nastase. Published on April 17, 2017. 0 The Android 7.1.2 update that Google has released is causing some major issues on the Pixel devices. We remind you that this was the latest update that the big search engine company has released and both the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL devices have some serious problems with it. While the update comes with several bug fixes and improvements, it appears that it’s also causing some issues related to the fingerprint scanner. In addition, it also brings other annoying errors, which Google will most likely fix sometime in the near future. In concordance with Android Police, there are users who have reported that the fingerprint on their Nexus and Pixel devices has stopped working right after they’ve updated to Android 7.1.2 Nougat. The affected devices are: Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL. The users have also tried to fix the issue by themselves by removing the pre-existing fingerprints and adding new ones. However, that didn’t solve the problem and an error is appearing when trying to add new prints to the handset. Google has not stated anything about these issues, but there are rumors saying that the big search engine company is already working on a fix for the fingerprint problem. We also have to mention that there are some Pixel and Pixel XL owners who have complained that their devices have some Bluetooth setup problems. However, we remind you that this problem has been present since the February security patch was released. It seems that the Bluetooth feature is failing to connect to cars, which is quite annoying for the users who are using this option while driving. Have you updated your Pixel or Pixel XL device to Android 7.1.2 Nougat? Tell us what other issues you have found after installing the latest Android OS version on your device!

The vulnerability will be patched on all versions of Chrome, including those on iOS and macOS. Google will be a little late to the party considering the fact that this bug has already been patched in Apple’s Safari and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer and Edge. The bug in question takes advantage of Punycode which uses certain ASCII characters in URLs to output Unicode in a browser. This allows phishers to register fake domains in Chrome that actually look like legitimate domains. Such a domain can lure visitors into divulging their personal information, including but not limited to names, addresses, emails, passwords, PIN numbers, and more. Software engineer Xudong Zheng created a safe proof-of-concept which appears to direct visitors to apple.com but in reality, takes them to www.xn--80ak6aa92e.com. Google was notified about this vulnerability in Chrome on January 20th and it’s not immediately clear what has taken the company so long to fix this. The fix is now available in Chrome builds in the experimental Canary program for Windows, macOS, and Android. The update now has to go through Chrome’s regular beta channel before it’s released for everyone at some point next week. Filed in Web. Read more about Google and google chrome.

The LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 have already unveiled phones rocking displays with 18:9 aspect ratios this year, and it's likely that others will follow in the next few months - so what are the advantages? This selection of apps should give you some idea - they all benefit in some way from having a tall or wide display, and should look great on an 18:9 phone. We've focused on Android, as it's unlikely that Apple will adopt the aspect ratio in the near future. 1. Opera A tall 18:9 quite simply gives you more webpage to look at, and so web browsing is one of the areas where an elongated display should prove useful - you get just a bit more room for those sports scores or news reports or whatever you're reading. Chrome is the default browser on Android, but Opera is a capable alternative if you want something different. Opera (free) 2. Netflix You might think Netflix is an obvious choice for a super-wide display, but what you might not know is that a lot of original Netflix content - including Stranger Things and House of Cards - is filmed in the 2:1 Univisium format, which some filmmakers are pushing as a preferable aspect ratio compromise between television formats and cinema standards. Netflix (free, requires subscription) 3. VLC As for your own 2:1 videos, if you've got any, we'd recommend VLC as one of the best choices on Android. Not only can it handle pretty much any video format you care to throw at it, the app also supports local network and internet streaming, plus a bunch of other goodies - like the option to manually adjust the aspect ratio of what you're watching. VLC (free) 4. Twitter We could've put pretty much any social networking app here, with the 18:9 screen able to show even more of your feed, but we've chosen Twitter because this is the one you're probably refreshing the fastest. It also tends to mix up the timeline with ads and tweets you might have missed, so you need as much vertical screen space as you can get. Twitter (free) 5. Gmail This one's a bit more speculative on our part, but with Google urging developers to make adjustments for 18:9 screens, we're hoping Google's own apps take the lead - and that might mean a customised view for Gmail more like the interface it uses for tablets, where you can get a look at your inbox and a preview of the current message at the same time. Gmail (free) 6. Google Maps Another Google app that we think could make great use of that extra screen real estate is Google Maps - whether you're lost in a foreign city or sat navving your way to a friend's house, those extra few millimetres (either in height or width) could make all the difference when it comes to working out where to go next or spotting a traffic jam ahead. Google Maps (free) 7. Amazon Kindle Put that additional space to good use and turn your phone into a makeshift e-reader courtesy of Amazon's Kindle app: if you've got an actual Kindle, you can sync your reading between devices, but if not you can just stick to your 18:9 phone. Plenty of free texts are available for those of you trying to read on a budget, and the full library is a vast one. Amazon Kindle (free) 8. Infinite Painter Another type of app where the extra screen space can be really helpful is in digital painting and sketching apps - such as Infinite Painter, which is our pick here, and packed with a fine choice of brushes and other features. With an 18:9 aspect ratio, you can keep your tools and palettes more towards the edges of the canvas and away from your masterpiece. Infinite Painter (free) 9. Jetpack Joyride Any endless runner will benefit from the extra on-screen width that an 18:9 screen provides - as long as the app has been updated to take advantage - and here we've gone for Jetpack Joyride, one of the best of the genre. The game gets very fast very quickly but manages to stay interesting no matter how many hours you end up ploughing into it. Jetpack Joyride (free) 10. LG G6 camera app Last but not least there's the native camera app that LG has included with its G6. You get an extra row of thumbnails down the side of the screen so you can keep track of the shots you've taken without having to keep jumping in and out of the gallery. Samsung's camera app also works well at the 18:9 aspect ratio, but LG's effort is just a little more polished.

About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Menu About Techzim Contact Us Send a Tip Search advertisement Homepage » e-learning » 5 reasons why you should participate in the Google Digital Skills Training program 5 reasons why you should participate in the Google Digital Skills Training program Posted 17 Mar 2017 by Trycolyn Pikirayi (@trycolynTP) Read 21 Comments I’m pretty sure one way or the other, you’ve heard about the digital skills training that Google has been conducting throughout Africa. Over the last two days, there has been talk on how the initiative has finally reached Zimbabwe. In light of this, I thought it important for me to just give you simple reasons (that you might have just overlooked) on why you should actually participate. 1. It’s free Well, I know that might sound silly but free doesn’t really mean much to Zimbos when it comes to tech related workshops (my observation at least and please feel free to prove me wrong). Unless of course there is free food and/or refreshments. Nonetheless, I personally feel like free things should really be taken advantage of. I guarantee you that the next time you want to learn this very content Google is offering, it will not be for free! Or maybe you-yourself will teach the content you acquired for free someday at a cost – it’s called business. 2. No qualification prerequisite Maybe some of you are familiar with the hassle of applying for a vacancy and the struggle of trying to make your qualifications sound like a cut above the rest. If you know what I’m talking about, then you know exactly why I put this as a reason to attend. Google, (as we know it) is offering digital skill courses and you do not need any qualifications to partake! Therefore, there is no restriction, any ambitious entrepreneur can benefit from this, regardless of educational background (which is not always a fitting criteria to use for most of us, but story for another day!). advertisement 3. Lessons applicable to any line of business The general perception is that only tech related businesses should participate, but that’s entirely misleading. Google acknowledges that the world is fast digitising, therefore, to remain relevant in any field, there is need for businesses and individuals to learn these skills and keep up. Luke Mckend, the Google SA country director testifies on how local businesses have been helped since the offered tools and technologies are basic enablers that can be applied to literally any line of business. In fact, this is an opportunity for individuals to leverage the internet in order to give their businesses an online presence which is much more robust than the traditional way of doing business. 4. Person to person training In as much as the content being learnt is being made available online (for now that is) g.co/digitalskills ,if there is a chance to actually meet face to face with the teacher, why not? Maybe I am still backward for being biased towards learning in the old fashioned classroom way, but I would take that over online any day only if it’s an available alternative. However, this point is mostly relevant to those who actually need the digital skills first to then know how to access online material.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail?

I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

The agreement was announced today by Alexei Dostenko, deputy head of Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, according to Russian news reports. Under the settlement, Google is to pay 439 million rubles (USD 7.8 million) in fines and will not limit the pre- installation of third-party apps, the reports said. The case was brought to the FAS in 2015 by Yandex, which is Russia's dominant search engine and offers various apps including a popular one for ordering taxis. Yandex's shares surged 6 per cent on the Moscow stock exchange after the settlement was announced.

Weekend poll: Inbox or Gmail? David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/04/16 1:01pm PDTApr 16, 2017 69 Plus 1 on G+ 131 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares248 Applications Polls Google Inbox and Gmail have been competing for our hearts (and email) for some time now, and it doesn't seem like Google is slowing down development of either [great] app. Clearly, Gmail is for some, and Inbox for others - so which one are you? I'm personally keeping one foot in both doors right now. I use Inbox for 100% of my personal email on both mobile and desktop, and I have zero inclination to go back. I also use Inbox for work email here at Android Police when I'm on the go. But on the desktop, AP email goes through a fairly fastidiously managed tabbed Gmail layout, something I'm not sure I could function without. Inbox on the desktop with my AP email address would be a nightmare to sort through and manage, given I receive anywhere from 100 to 300 emails in a single day. So, how about you? Inbox? Gmail? Both? Neither? vote in the poll and talk it out in the comments below. Inbox or Gmail? Gmail Inbox Both Neither View Results  Loading ... Tags Gmail inbox poll sidebar-poll weekend poll subscribe ...

Andrew Palmer GSuite account, so Gmail is my only option. David Ruddock Inbox works fine for Gsuite, it just has to be enabled by your admin. Andrew Palmer All typical Google services are set to 'On for everyone'. That said i just reinstalled the Inbox app, which I haven't tried to use since it lost its invite only status way back when, and indeed it works. Thanks. Wang Jun Lem Both. Inbox is extremely neat and is easy to handle especially on mobile, but filters are out, and the search function is horrible at determining what's relevant. I keep a tab open for each. Markus Birth I love the auto-detection of flights, restaurant bookings and other events of Inbox (Especially because I add those that are not detected automatically or where there's no mail via this tool I built so they also show up on Google Now.) and the auto-sorting into different folders. But I feel it's (web and app) getting slower and slower with every update. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Same here, I love the auto detection of flights, hotels and other event Geoff Johnson Gmail does this as well. Markus Birth The last time I checked, GMail didn't detect all the types Inbox did. Also GMail doesn't combine everything into "Trips", does it? StankyChikin Inbox allow you to mark read and archive yet? Raymond Hawkins It's always allowed you to archive. That's what "done" does. I don't think you can mark as read though. roberto.elena I'm pretty sure read/unread is considered a legacy feature by the Inbox team. Roderick Gadellaa Both. Because I need signatures for aliases i use for work (I basically never use my @gmail address) and Inbox still doesn't do that. On mobile I'm pretty much inbox-only though. roberto.elena That was my problem, too, but it's solved now. Well, it's not 100% automatic like in Gmail, but you can save each signature as a template and then insert them manually when you need them. I like this method better as I don't always need to include my signature in my work emails. What is weird is that templates will show as a draft emails in Gmail, but not in Inbox. https://support.google.com/inbox/answer/7107959?hl=en Dystopia USA gmail on my laptop/desktop. inbox on my android. aaron cooper I don't even remember what Gmail looks like.... Eric Karnes Inbox on mobile, Gmail on the desktop. darkvadur same demarcmj This. I don't use any of the fancy "features" of Inbox... I just like it because the interface is nicer. But for some reason on the desktop Inbox is slower than molasses. Like dial-up speed on a decades-old computer slow. So I use gmail on desktop. SpasilliumNexus On phone, Inbox for my main account, Gmail for others. Gmail for everything on desktop. Daniel Gherard I personally prefer Inbox. But, it's not like Gmail is bad. It's just a preference. For me, Inbox looks way better than Gmail and structures my emails in a neat way. sgtguthrie Unfortunately, I miss important emails with inbox, so I use Gmail. If it's not broke... M Gordon That's what happened to me Everytime I tried inbox so I only use Gmail. Has it been fixed yet? sgtguthrie It wasn't the last time I tried it, about 6 months ago. Dennis Bareis What needs fixing? It can be a bit confusing at times, you probably set up a bundle that shows up later. M Gordon No I didn't set anything, what I mean is I would only get notified about emails a couple hours after Gmail notified me. This happened with all my emails. darkvadur there is a problem with your phone OS, have you enabled a custom save battery feature or something? what ROM are you using Inbox is better than gmail to me MicroNix You summed it up yourself. It's a confusing app. It's also lags gmail in notifications. It just feels like one of those half baked Google apps. Kyle J Inbox is not supposed to send you notifications unless they are important. I got so many Gmail notifications I did not need. I use Inbox just for personal use though. I'm not sure how I would feel about using it for work since I have never used it that way. Dollar Flipper I have no idea what this means. New emails come in just like any other email app... catalysto Turn off the bundling. Notifications can be set for each bundle, so some emails are probably being added to bundles that have notifications turned off. Kevin Sword Adding on to this, add all bundles to the inbox. Check your spam folder 📂 frequently. Otherwise you might miss important mail ✉ that the AI thinks is unimportant. theProffer Same. I followed the repliers' suggestions as well, and I still have issues with Inbox's push notifications. It almost gives me the impression that it's polling and not pushing (I know it's not, but it's laggy as if that). If I could get these email notifications immediately, I'd probably switch, but I also love some of the more granular controls Gmail has (which maybe Inbox has duplicated over time, I haven't tried it in about 6'ish months). -Matoro Zeliph- Gmail...because I got used to the clunky nature from dealing with all the time from work. Alex Inbox snoozing/pinning is too good to not use most of the time. Occasionally I have to go to GMail for something. But 90% of the time it's Inbox. StarLightPL Gmail has hangout history and is sometimes more clear presenting new mails. Inbox has neater hangout integration but no history search (why?). I switch between both. Raymond Hawkins The only time I open Gmail instead of inbox anymore is to search chat history. Because for some dumb reason you can't do that from inbox. David Ruddock because RIP hangouts Tom Westrick Google would like to offer some Allo for that burn Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Brian Nice Word Play Pascal Welsch Creating filters is another reason why I have to open Gmail Raymond Hawkins I was forgetting that one. I do occasionally open Gmail for filters also. catalysto It makes sense that you can't do it from Inbox because the search function should be built directly into Hangouts. But for some dumb reason, Google, the king of search, never added that. /shruggie 😆😄 +1 for /shruggie The Tech Temple ¯_(ツ)_/¯ OhYeah! I think Google has also totally failed at search in the play store. I almost never get the app I want even in the first page of results when searching for the exact name. Martins Nkem Still using GMail until Google makes Inbox actually work catalysto Inbox works great. Martins Nkem It sucks at handling attachments catalysto I never run into that problem. Martins Nkem Where does it store the attachments you've viewed? Kevin Sword It doesn't? You have to manually download them. catalysto They remain in Inbox. Where else would they go? Martins Nkem What i meant was this.. In Gmail, attachments are usually saved in the downloads folder in local storage, where does Inbox save its own files catalysto They can be kept in Inbox, saved to Drive, or downloaded locally. Not sure what else you'd need. Martins Nkem Which folder is it downloaded to locally? catalysto Whichever one you want! You've never used the Save As dialog?! Martins Nkem On mobile? catalysto Ohhhhh, on mobile. Forgive me; I was thinking desktop. But yeah, on mobile, attachments go to the Downloads folder like other apps. Martins Nkem Not in my case, it redownloads the files every time catalysto Redownloads? As in downloads every time you tell it to download? That's normal. Timothy Vreeland No it doesn't. It has syncing issues with many devices. darkvadur fix your phone and it will work it's not google fault if your phone have problems. catalysto Never had that problem, and I use it on all my devices. Mbdo Inbox because of auto-categorized e-mails and no sponsored e-mails (like Gmail) Furthermore the web version of Gmail is really old (Google Agenda too) Timothy Vreeland What is a sponsored email? Been using Gmail since it was invitation only, and never saw one. Mbdo In Gmail, on the categories (like "social" for example) I have some "ad" emails just like Google AdWords on the Web... It's not the case for Inbox. Check this screenshot : https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ca9d6f5a0599814fa001c5add402543e0ab9e13c245dcd6e5177bb5026c9708b.png Christopher Bement I flip flop every few months. Gmail has some great feature that haven't made it to Inbox yet, like inserting Gifs with Gboard. But the snoozing is sooooooo useful. someone755 The GMail app is a mess on Android. It's big, it's clunky, and it's barely optimized. Inbox looks sleek and conveniently sorts things into categories that a mobile user would appreciate. On the desktop however, Inbox is unusable. You quickly realize that automatically sorting your emails won't get you anywhere, and that the design takes a step back in terms of functionality as compared to Gmail. Tyler Walles Gmail, classic, catergories disabled, because I will sort it myself, and dont judge me when I say my inbox has more then 5000 emails El Presidente I don't really want or need an email app that tries to be anything more than an email app so Gmail works fine for me. I've tried to use Inbox tonnes of times and never used it for more than a day. roberto.elena If you literally never used it more than a day, then you probably never used the snooze feature, which is one of Inbox more important advantages compared to Gmail. El Presidente I suppose it depends on what you want from email. All I want to do with emails is read and respond to them. If I have one that I don't want to respond when I read it, I'll just leave it in my inbox and respond when it suits. Snooze isn't something I'd ever need. Inbox, in my opinion, just over complicates things. roberto.elena I think it mostly depends on what volume of important emails you get. Sure, if you only have one email now and then that you want to reply later, you don't need Inbox, but if you need to have many of those in your Gmail inbox, it gets rapidly crowded. And there are many times, at least in my case that I know exactly when I want to deal with a message, instead of a generic "later". For example, on friday I snooze ALL my unarchived work emails until monday morning. I certainly don't need/want to see those emails during the weekend on my inbox. For the rest I decide on a case by case basis. Fruity101079 It's strange to understand. On friday, just leave your unread emails where there are. There will be there on Monday when you will come back to your office... roberto.elena I manage several email addresses within a single Gmail account, including my work email. Fruity101079 Why mix work and personal emails if you don't want to check them on the weekend? Didn't your employer give you a phone? roberto.elena I don't receive work emails on the weekends, so it's not that I don't want to check new work emails on the weekends, it's that I don't need to see the pending emails in my inbox while I definitely don't need them until monday. And yes, I prefer to mix personal and work emails in the same app (I use filters and labels I already created in Gmail, not just the automatic categories of Inbox, and they work with Inbox just fine too). The work email weekend situation is just one example of why I love snoozing, but there are many interesting uses. You buy something on ebay from Hong Kong and it's expected to arrive in 10-15 days. Well no need to have that in you inbox 10 days, you just snooze it. Somebody tells you they are going to contact you back in 3 days time, Well, 3 days later, that email reappears in your inbox to remind you that, in case they didn't. Etc. If you don't have a too many of those emails cluttering your inbox, then it's understandable you don't see the need for snoozing, but for many of us Inbox is the best that has happened to email since Gmail was launched. The same way that Gmail turned emails into conversations (and of course also offered 1GB instead Hotmail's 15-25 MB), changing email for many of us forever, Inbox has turned emails into tasks, with its done/pinned/snoozed paradigm. Geoff Johnson That seems overly complicated. Why not have a work email and a personal email? Why have them both go to the same inbox? That way you can just ignore anything coming to your personal email without it cluttering your personal inbox. roberto.elena Because I still want to check my personal email while I'm at work, my private life doesn't stop simply because I'm at work, and I don't get many work related emails outside of working hours, so they don't bother me in my free time, and even when I do get some, it's so easy and fast to snooze them, so it is much better for me to have everything in one place. In my case it's​ more complicated having two inboxes instead of one. catalysto I feel the opposite. Inbox simplifies things for me because it keeps only the emails I need to pay attention to at any given time and hides the rest. It's done wonders for my workflow. Thisismyusername1982 Thats what the archive button is for. catalysto Archive is not snooze. Archived messages do not reappear at a predetermined time or location. The snooze feature is the magic that makes it so useful for me. Archive does not do this. Fruity101079 If you don't need to pay attention to some emails (spam?), why not just delete them? catalysto Because I often want to come back to them later. For example, an email to pay a bill, but I don't want to do it at work. If I want to snooze that action until I get home, I can do that. And that's the core difference with Inbox: emails aren't just messages; they are to-dos. For someone who likes to use the zero-inbox, GTD flow, it's amazing. But of course, that's personal preference, and I get that lots of people don't use email that way. Geoff Johnson That's exactly what I don't like about it. Then those emails get lost and forgotten about. If it's spam, just delete/block it. Kevin Sword That's what you use the snooze feature for. It'll send you another notification when you actually need to get something done. catalysto But I'm not talking about spam. I'm talking about messages I want to deal with at a later time. I never see spam in my inbox. And the snoozed messages don't get "lost and forgotten". Snoozed emails reappear at a predetermined time or place. Kevin Sword Yeah, I always have a completely clear inbox which is pretty incredible. I can snooze stuff that doesn't need to be dealt with. catalysto Yeah, I love seeing that sun shining background when I'm done with my tasks. =) tekfr33kn Choices... m-p{3} I switched to Inbox as soon as I could at work (I'm not the Google Apps Admin). The snooze feature is wonderful, and I can use my emails as a ToDo list as I go. Dollar Flipper The only people I've seen with this issue didn't clean up their inbox at the start. You need to snooze/mark everything in your email as done and then work from there. El Presidente Both my inboxes are pretty "clean" (at the moment, there's one unread mail in each) and I get circa 15-20 emails a day in each. Snoozing an email is as good as leaving it in your inbox, so you can see it every time you access your account works for me. Snoozed mails would just mean I'd keep snoozing them and never respond. I've a pretty good labelling/filter system, inbox just complicates that. I get inbox works for some people, just not for me. HSidhu with Gmail you don't get reminder and 'save it later' (saved) tab, I wish they put that in the gmail. catalysto Snoozed messages notify you when they reappear. It works more as a GTD to-do list than just a simple list of emails. For a lot of people, that works better. m-p{3} Yeah, at some point I figured that I couldn't possibly sort through it all, so I had to make the call to mark everything "done" and keep my mailbox clean from that moment. So far, my goal is to reach that beautiful sun at the end of the day. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/414cadbe40ffe9b274cc1af9f92d36e8753dc782ac466fc16e1de0959c6fb364.png Marvin R. I totally agree. Inbox is only good for the 0 inbox approach people (where every mail is a kind of little task for them) which is for me a goal I don't want to achieve because I want to see as much mails as possible to browse through them. The big fonts/spacing in inbox + making unrelevant mails bigger (like mails of purchases) is not working for me. Tried so often. Never worked out. My chaos system + some filters and *colorful* labels works better than AI assisted ones (for me). roberto.elena You can use the same labels and filters in Inbox, they work exactly like the automatic Inbox bundles. Marvin R. yes I know. But actually I'm loosing how many are unread in the labels and (which is worse for me) I loose the colors of labels :( roberto.elena Well, if the label colors are important to you, then I agree it sucks. I used to have a lot of filters/labels in Gmail, but now using Inbox I found I don't need most of them, so the automatic Inbox categories plus a couple a my own labels work for me. At first I also felt some "read/unread anxiety", when I started using Inbox, but then I realized it wasn't an issue anymore. With Inbox my inbox is as clean as possible, so I can clearly see what's unread and what's read there. If something is not in my inbox, then it means I already decided whether it's "done" or "snoozed", so I don't really care about read/unread. Maybe you have filters that send emails to a label skipping the inbox and that's why you need the unread count, but I think the bundling in Inbox is a good alternative for that. Of course all of this is MY opinion, related to MY needs. Your mileage may vary. It's not the first poll of this kind that i see, and Inbox adoption is clearly improving over time. I don't remember any spectacular changes in Inbox lately, so I think one of the reasons is that people are slowly understanding how to better use Inbox, and that's why I replied to several comments here, to explain things they might not realize. Of course, there will be always people that don't use Inbox despite fully understanding its features. You might be one of them... or not. kajover inbox.. i just switch back to gmail for the settings DKS No poll selection to accurately record my response -- Gmail for personal, Boxer for work. Boxer was part of Cynanogen OS when I had my OPO and I just stuck with it when I set up my Pixel. It works fine for my work needs. Maybe I just don't realize what I'm missing with Inbox, though. Metallinatus Good thing that you work with your boxers on. mcdonsco Gmail, that I don't use much. My main email is exchange and while it technically works in Gmail, it's not robust enough for my needs so I use Nine. Metallinatus Gmail on desktop have been dead for years, this is not 2010 anymore, I use Inbox because of the much more modern interface. But I still need to use Gmail to search for something in those old Hangouts conversations that are kept there, don't know why Inbox couldn't just be able to do that too.... obarthelemy I have several non-gmail email addresses, and I'm trying to keep things standard, so I'm sticking with AOSP mail, which is pure IMAP with no lock-in special features. M6 You can use gmail for non-gmail addresses, and you can use AOSP mail or other IMAP clients with gmail addresses (you can export all your gmail emails as well). There is no lock-in whatsoever... obarthelemy Yes there is. Tags, rules, filters, snooze.... are nonstandard, so if you start to depend on them on them you can no longer move away. Lock-in is not just about the raw data, it's also about the process you build around features. aRvInD I am impressed with mymail's almost instant push notification. So I'm using. If Inbox supports IMAP like Gmail, it'd be awesome..! Miku is Best Vocaloid Inbox is sexier and more useful to me. My1 it's not like you can go childmaking with an app anyway, so why use that as reasoning? lzdking Sexy is a common adjective to describe the aesthetics of inanimate objects (cars, boats, buildings etc...), not sure why you are taking exception to its use. My1 I thought maybe it was obvious, or just forgot the (/s), well Poe's Law strikes again ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Technically you have to have both with Inbox. Love the look of Inbox but don't like how the attachment size is limited on Inbox Michael Sørensen How and why do you get 100 to 300 emails in a single day!? Seriously. I use Outlook with one personal account and 2 work accounts. Every type of auto-categorizing and sorting turned off. Dennis Bareis "Filters" and search in Inbox are hopeless, but it has Snooze and it "decodes" travel and other emails. IUf GMAIL did that I'd go back in a sec. Tom Westrick Gmail, since it does what I need it to. Haven't felt a reason to switch away Wayren Inbox 100% of the time. I had no idea how perfect this product was for me until I started using it for my personal email. Cristian-Teodor TATOIU Samsung Email all the way! iluvthesoftsoft inbox for personal use, gmail for work Fotis Nakos Whenever Inbox offers Labels and Sublabels, I'll consider. Until then, Gmail and yes, I cannot work differently. mickey4mice Inbox for me, but it's impossible to delete a single email from a threaded conversation without making a total mess. If I forward an email to myself, I still go to Gmail to delete the forwarded version without fearing I might delete the original. Andy McDearmon I use Inbox on any Android device, and Gmail on my PC. Nate Inbox all the way but they need to add print functionality to it.. Dollar Flipper Inbox has revolutionized my personal e-mail usage. Turning e-mails into reminders has made such a big difference. If I could get desktop Outlook to work like Inbox, my work email would be even better. Outlook app for the phone added this but it isn't all seamless yet. NooSH Inbox all day. Andrew Last time I tried Inbox, I couldn't add an Exchange account so it's useless to me. I'm not going to go back and forth using multiple email clients. Gmail does it all and it does it well. Harold JP Castro Gmail because when you have filters set up it behaves pretty much like Inbox (except for snoozing) Margaritas Ante Porcos Inbox is like Google+. Few people say they love it but you never meet nobody who uses them in reality. Also, I think some people like to test new things, awaiting for them to become a trend, so they could be that crowd that's always on top. I mean, Inbox is not a phenomenon Gmail once was. It is just a gimmick for few geeks. Bob Allen I guess I don't get enough e-mail to use anything but Gmail.. Work e-mail is a completely different system. That said, Inbox did seem like a good way to organize multiple accounts when I tried it. Erik Inbox most of the time, Gmail for searching and dealing with labels. Branko Paid email hosting + own domain. That's how you actually own your emails. Mike K? Not sure what you're getting at, I doubt most people here care. Kevin Sword Not until you're running your own server you're not! /s but seriously. Henrique Persechini I've realized once I've started using Inbox that all my carefully organized labels never actually helped me in any way except keeping my organization anxiety occupied. Once I was set free, I went with a zero label email and have been loving it ever since Hector Diaz Inbox just missing the option to print to be perfect Colin Rowlands The ideal for me would be Gmail with snooze, that was the main thing I liked about Inbox, but it wasn't enough to keep me using it. Trooper311 Gmail ftw. M. Luciano Inbox all day long. CasperTFG I miss Mailbox. Gone from Blue Mail, Aqua Mail to Newton. Now on MailDroid and MailCal. Anything other than Inbox and Gmail. Rob H. Neither. I use: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easilydo.mail Gmail app has been terrible. surethom Gmail. All the way just wish you could turn off conversion view it just does not work. Jon Fridman While I enjoy many features of Gmail, Inbox has reminders, and pinned emails. Nothing beats the Inbox experiences for what I need. There are some shortcomings for both on desktop and mobile. Andy I prefer the simplicity of Gmail, I just wish Gmail had the nicer animations and material design of Inbox, and pulled in sender images like Inbox does (like an Amazon email having the Amazon logo instead of a big circle with an A in it). Joseph Hurtsellers I've used Inbox since it came out. I recently switched back to gmail. The reason is I kept having tons of laggy time out issues on my chromebook. (I tried multiple solutions including a power wash). But what I've also noticed attaching files; copying items and pasting ect. is MUCH easier for me on Gmail. Just IMHO. waloody88 Gmail looks professional and is functional for me. Didn't like inbox. It felt like an app designed for childern Jared Gauthier The only time I use Gmail is to search in Trash. You can't do that in Inbox. Once and awhile I'll delete an email thinking I won't need it anymore and then end up needing it. Mike Dawson "Once in a while". Sorry, I'm not usually the grammar police. Jared Gauthier Haha thanks. Edited. I'm usually conscious of that stuff. Mike Dawson I hate myself for posting that! Jared Gauthier I forgive you. axnjackson11 If you want to search in Trash in Inbox, this is what you need to type: in:trash whatever you're looking for. Once you put in:trash at the front, it'll properly show whatever you're looking for just in the Trash. Jared Gauthier I'll try that! Adonis K. Inbox all the way, handling 100s of emails per day without it is simply crazy. Tomáš Petrík I just can't look at my emails as tasks, they are, well, emails. I tried to use Inbox, but I noped out back to Gmail. Karl Mathias Moberg I use both. I use inbox for my personal email on my phone, but on the desktop I use the web gmail app. For my work email I use the Gmail app. Find it easier to sort this way, and since I don't have the same categories for my work email I prefer the basic app. getinet Gmail on desktop. Inbox on mobile. Nick Cannon Only a matter of time before Google Kills inbox HSidhu could be... lol Abraham When inbox came out I tried it and found there was no mark as read option. DOA for me at least. Who knows if they have it now, never bothered to try it again. Willie Chalmers III That's sort of one of Inbox's big selling features. There's certainly a mark as read button along with email snoozing. Leonardo Baez Gmail. Vever tried inbox. I see no sense TechGuy22 Gmail either way Google wins. Tobias A. G. Gmail is just awful. I wish I could uninstall it. BC I much prefer Inbox by Gmail...It's less clunky for me and makes dealing with my emails easier. Inbox tends to sort my emails smartly so I never have to futz with sorting emails, as Inbox does it fairly well. When I do make changes those changes are always respected by Inbox by Gmail. It's much more refreshing than plain Gmail, at least from my perspective. Aaron T Inbox on mobile but Gmail on desktop. Inbox website is way slower and clunky outside of the mobile app. makapav I also use GMail for more powerful search with the drop-down boxes for email. InBox needs to still catch-up with GMail in lots of functionality that I think is fringe but very valuable. dblock Tried to use Inbox once when it first came out, however it seemed to over complicate email. I also don't really use email for much at all outside of work, which I have access to Outlook for while at work. Otherwise all my emails are just promotions and payment receipts/shipping updates. I just stick with Gmail. C64 The stock mail app from Samsung on my S7 edge Vivek Rameses That's surprisingly a really good client. Max Johnson AOSP Email. Adrianus AJ Nadeak Inbox because it makes using email bearable. Scott Harris I use a desktop mail app for my work and personal email, so using Inbox is a waste of time for me Scott Harris On mobile I use gmail since I can access my work email within the gmail app. Paul Quinn Gmail. Mostly because my email habits are so hardwired at this point from using Exchange at work. I haven't gone back and tried Inbox in a while. It does have a learning curve and you have to commit to it for a period of time to give it a fair shake. Iamsecond I'm not particularly a fan of either interface, but Gmail wins for me because I just want to organise my own email how I want it, without an algorithm deciding for me! Justin Osborne If I need to find an email, I use Gmail. Inbox search is TERRIBLE. I use Inbox for everything else though. ekngee Inbox for personal, Gmail for work (because my workplace is still too stubborn to learn new things. some even cannot stop using Outlook even though our emails go thru Gmail servers) Timothy Vreeland Inbox is prettier, so I have tried to use it, but it seems pointless. Lacks features I use, but it's main feature of auto sorting always messes something up and overcomplicates email. 99% of the time, an email is important and I'll open it, or it's spam and I'll mark it as so. No point in having a big messy system to auto manage 1% of my mail. Adrien Baron You can configure everything if you want too, create your own bundles (which are actually just GMail tags under the hood), and choose wether you want them to appear bundled or not, and be notified or not. I almost had nothing to configure for my personal, but did it for my work address (we are using Inbox), and it works great. Deeco Wow, I'm surprised by the poll. Honestly, I find Inbox confusing as hell! whispy_snippet It's like a lot of things in that you just need to get used to it. Once you do it's awesome. Marty If it weren't for the fact you can't have multiple accounts in Inbox, I'd give it a go. But I doubt it would be as good as Outlook since Gmail can't do a defaulted combined inbox. lzdking I'm surprised that I haven't seen more people mention using Outlook. While I don't use it myself (Inbox for me), Outlook is a very impressive Android e-mail client and the desktop interface isn't too shabby either. Marty It amazes me that Microsoft isn't capitalizing on Google's laziness. Not only is Microsoft's email better than anything Google has, but Google Search isn't anything like it used to be 5 to 8 years ago. Microsoft could step in and displace Google Search with their own search engine. Geoff Johnson That's what I don't get, there shouldn't be a need to "get used to it". Email is simple, it comes in you read/reply to it when you have time. If you don't want to now, simply ignore it and come back to it when you do. m-p{3} The thing is that keeping too many email "in sight" makes me unconsciously reread the titles everytime I go check my mailbox. If I can't reply to it right now (because of lack of info, progress) I can snooze it and keep it out of sight and focus on what's important right now. lzdking I don't get the "getting used to it" either. For me, I used inbox and was instantly amazed by how much more useful and organized it was. There was nothing to get, all my e-mails were automatically bundled into the categories I needed. darkvadur seems like your brain can't handle new things, how old are u? darkvadur inbox on my phone mostly because the actions buttons on notifications are more useful than gmails ones Bewear AOSP mail. #MasterRace (?) Marty Neither. I use Outlook. Best there is. Ryan N Yup. I also like Alto. Gmail is awful. Never used Inbox because of no multi email support. Joshua Talley Inbox is nice on mobile, but is horribly slow on the desktop. Gmail is reliable on both. I can effectively ignore huge swaths of mail using inbox very quickly, but I can actually mark them as read/unread in Gmail. It's a toss-up. Vivek Rameses Neither. Both are crap. K9 mail is hands down the best email client. Gordon Spurgeon Spooner Does ProtonMail work with K9? Vivek Rameses Paid accounts. HSidhu Inbox for mobile and gmail for desktop. lomsha Doesn't inbox only work with Gmail accounts? CD RW it works with other account if you "Gmailfy" them before https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 lomsha Aaah thank you. usnmustanger Your poll choices are inadequate. What about "Inbox & 3rd Party Client"? I use both Inbox and BlueMail, which has some major advantages over the Gmail app, such as snoozing messages, threaded viewing, etc.). With so many great 3rd party email apps out there, you ought to try to avoid sounding too fanboyish by taking such an "all-google-or-nothing" approach in your polls. Latheryin I don't bother with either. Inbox is just not versatile enough and Gmail is just too slow. Blue mail does. Everything needed and does it Pretty well. Ross I have to use Gmail, when I use Inbox my reminders don't always sync between inbox and the Google app, resulting in missed reminders. I rely on reminders too much. Otherwise I loved Inbox. Rook HD inbox is sleeker but it has a fatal flaw to me. it doesn't display the specific time of the received emails and for some reasons I can't stand that Scros97 You have to open the email you want to see the specific time and then click on the name of the other person. Doing so it displays more details like the date ;) Matt Blackberry Hub, which I guess kind of uses Gmail. Tristian Hill Always Inbox, except when my OCD kicks in and I've gotta "mark all conversations as read" and I'm too lazy to do it one by one on Inbox Scros97 I do the very same usage of Gmail 😂 Sudhir Khanger How does Inbox work with email that are notifications, mailing lists, bills, newsletters, etc.? These are not important and I would like to browse them at a later stage. I don't want to worry about them and I filter them in Gmail and look at them when needed every couple of days. CD RW they are automatically sorted in categories : notifications, travel, , social network ,financial,forums and deals And for each of these categories, you can choose how they appear on your Inbox : as soon as they arrive, once a day, once a week You can also create your own categories just like in gmail with labels HD If I could add my non-gmail address into Inbox, I would've happily voted for Inbox. Brendabcox Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Sherman Does Inbox support Yahoo or Live accounts? No? Even after a FULL YEAR since I last used it? Back to Gmail, then. CD RW Inbox support them if you "Gmailify" them : https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6304825 Eleo Outlook all the way! Gmail app is not as user-friendly as outlook and inbox knows too much about me. I dont like that Jan-Lk Else Phone: Inbox, PC/Web: Gmail. Best combination! Captain_Invisible I'm shocked! I can't believe there are still people using the Gmail app, when the glorious Inbox exists. I could never go back. Marty Lol...most people probably have multiple email accounts. Can't have multiple account in Inbox. 😉 Kristian Ivanov Quite surprising that both options have a 43% score at the time I'm writting this comment O_o For me it's Gmail...I just don't need any of the Inbox features so no point in using it...I do see reasons why others like it though. AQ apps? neither, gmail through k9 mail. Martin B. I never saw poll this close here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0edf28e3e42c8d0ad2c36a79e66f5cd9b16a678152108035c59111ee155ec76c.jpg Fruity101079 Inbox GUI is better, Gmail looks old, but I don't understand all those things in Inbox. There are tabs/categories (i don't need) everywhere. Some emails are not displayed in the main box. And there is no notifications or visual thing that tell me there is something new in this categories. There are no folders anymore. So all your emails from the creation of your account are all displayed in your main box (!?). A lot of persons are talking of Snooze option, but I don't get its utility (it's the same on my alarm clock, when it rings in the morning, i wake up. Done. Why using a ring to wake you up just enough to push the snooze button that will ring again 1 minute later? It's incomprehensible...). And one more thing: not talking about work (at work we are using the mailbox the society want you to use, if you got them on your personal phone it's a particular case), but seriously, what kind of life do you have to get so many emails each day that you don't have time to answer? How important could they be that you need to snooze them? If there are so important just reply! If there are so important, you won't forget! And it's not like emails are going to disappear as soon as you read them. They still will be there, in your mail box. There is no trap. ninjustin I snooze things all the time that come in during the work day I need to handle when I get home or on the weekends. It's also handy in keeping track of when I need to pay my bills. Nicholas Nezis If only Inbox supported a proper signature block, then I would switch over to Inbox 100%. Steve Crane The only time I open Inbox is when I want to clear my Gmail inbox by deferring (snoozing) mails I want to read in the evening or on the weekend. If snoozing was built into Gmail I would have no need for Inbox at all. Kostas 💪🎩 If inbox had a "mark as read and archive" function instead of just archive, I would change in a heartbeat ShahinTr Never got used to Inbox, especially that chat-esque conversation. Gave it so many chances, but I prefer the conventional email application. Also, Gmail has taken a few features from Inbox that have integrated well with it. BanksKillian tie Michel Sa Inbox is my to-do list, and that's all what i need from an email app. CD RW inbox can't leave inbox due to snooze by location (genious idea) and by time Fresh360 Inbox is a great app I love it, I don't know how I functioned on mobile without it but goodness gracious is it disastrous on the desktop so wide, so bright, so cumbersome. So I strictly use Gmail on the desktop, it's weird but the two email program route works the best. Justin Martin Why don't they just put the hangout's functionality in Gmail so you can set it up either way. Again Google putting out multiple apps just like the whole messaging thing. sloheim I've grown to appreciate Inbox (other than the painful slowness of the web version, it is BRUTAL). I just wish it worked with non-gmail accounts. If I could hook up my Office365 account, it would be ideal. Georg Eitler AOSP Mail. PC_Peasant’s number 1 fan Neither Chad Knasinski Gmail on the web because it is much faster than Inbox. Inbox for the app for the same reason. Rob Paek Wow, dead even at 43% for Gmail and Inbox! RomiresT Inbox desktop version is killing me. It hangs, lags and dissapoint me in last few month. So, I just switch back to Gmail. kjohnson04 Never could get into using Inbox. Count me in the Gmail camp. Suyash Bansal Inbox on PC and Gmail on phone. grebulon Hop email messanger (https://gethop.com/) is what inbox is unsuccessfully trying to do. SHunter I need Inbox to support Send Money / Request Money just like Gmail does.... kalehv I only use Gmail to reply/forward a specific message in the conversation (thread) Inbox doesn't do that. For Inbox, it's all or none. Garett You can do that now in Inbox :) kalehv haha, apparently yes, that works. Scott Breitbach Inbox, except when I need to search for something specific. rctx81 My main issue with Inbox is that, for the most part of the time, it doesnt seem to obey my previous Gmail filters and labels. I like its snooze/archive functions, but then I ended up using Spark on my MbPro/iPad, fell in love with it and now I cant wait for its Android version. Nowadays I barely touch Inbox on mobile and I try to process as much email as possible from my Mac and iPad. jamez243 Still can't print from within the inbox app... how has this not been fixed anymore? 1966CAH On the desktop- GMail. On my phone- Inbox. David I use both since I need to use gmail to access my college email account. But besides that, Inbox is life ipsofact Inbox all day ! saf1927 I didn't expect that many people preferring Inbox to Gmail. I remember I've only used it for a couple of months only because Gmail didn't have material design yet. Daniel Rodríguez Ycaza Gmail for laptop/desktop and Inbox for cellphone/tablet works for me! Hurricane Andrew I've been using Inbox since it was invite only. It's changed the way I use email, allowing me to keep a nice clean inbox, quickly triage messages, and avoid the feeling of being overwhelmed by the volume of messages that I get on a daily basis. Jim I've tried Inbox... it's just too much work for me. Gmail works just fine for my needs which is reading regular emails, most of which are sales/marketing and other "subscription" emails. I don't get a lot of personal emails so all that compartmentalizing just got to be way too much to handle. b_boogey_xl After multiple start and fails, I finally realized how to use Inbox and once I discovered that, I haven't looked back. When I use regular email, all I think to myself is how much better the experience would be if I could filter it through Inbox. Ygor Cortes The problem with Inbox is that it only supports Google emails, so Gmail is the way to go for me. Ygor Cortes Inbox's website is miles better than Gmail's though. No competition there. Pedro Diego Fernández I get an email, I read/answer/delete it... done... don't want any "smart" sorting or e-learning algorithm...I don't even use the tabs in gmail that sort email into ads, social media and work... I'll handle my stuff myself... to me the only thing gmails need is an option to schedule an answer, because sometimes I'll sit at night an write the answers and keep them as drafts ti send them in the morning in business hours Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 142k 106k Latest Deals 8 [Deal Alert] Here are 25 temporarily free and 39 on-sale apps to help start off the week 2017/04/17 3:48pm PDTApr 17, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] LG Tone Platinum wireless neckbuds as low as $84.99 new ($115 off), $76.99 refurbished 2017/04/17 1:28pm PDTApr 17, 2017 16 [Deal Alert] Refurbished and AT&T Galaxy S7 on sale for $289.99 via eBay with coupon [Update] 2017/04/17 1:20pm PDTApr 17, 2017 11 Humble Mobile Bundle: Great Adventures includes Grim Fandango Remastered, Lumino City, and more 2017/04/17 11:53am PDTApr 17, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Get the HTC U Ultra for $599 ($150 off), HTC 10 for $499 ($200 off), and One A9 for $199 ($300 off) 2017/04/17 11:32am PDTApr 17, 2017 Latest Poll Inbox or Gmail?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 68 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 77 Share on Twitter Total Shares253 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason.

Thanks for the ingenious insight. thereasoner Even if all 156 are genuine it would still be quite a small number of users no? Bruce Wayne Except that's not the number of people experiencing problems. thereasoner Still, when there are well over 900 people in India signing a petition just for the 6p to have voLTE activated and the whole world combined can only manage 156 for this issue then it kind of says something imo. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers...

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far.........

New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Disappeared? You're just not worth the time. But I came here to get a link and noticed your reply. So... Someone tell this guy he's a big fat liar: support dot google dot com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg This Google fanboy is a big fat liar, too: highonandroid dot com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Here's that liar's video. He must have hacked the video to support his lies about there being a halo problem. www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=GUjhM2xcKSY whispy_snippet Yes, so as I've agreed many times now, there is a halo effect that sometimes (very rarely) occurs when shooting with the Pixel in specific circumstances. But I see you've conveniently ignored the chromatic aberation and purple flaring I pointed out in the G6 images. No surprises there. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. whispy_snippet Yep, no response. Thought so. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Jordan L I'll say that I snap a lot of photos with my Pixel XL.. I have seen the lens flare issue when there is direct full sun at a certain angle on the lens. Rare, but fun to reproduce for Pixel haters. Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable.

I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars MARKETING Exclusive Facebook no longer measures total app installs because developers don’t care Ken Yeung@thekenyeung April 17, 2017 8:00 AM Tags: Christine De Martini, f8, F8 2017, Facebook, Facebook App Ads, Facebook App Marketing, Facebook Developers, facebook marketing, Facebook Mobile App Installs, Facebook News, Mobile App Installs Above: Facebook's iconic sign on display outside its Menlo Park, Calif. headquarters. Image Credit: Facebook Facebook is shifting away from using “total installs” — an industry metric that advertisers and developers have known for a while — as a measurement for how successful its app business is. In its efforts to court more advertisers, the social media company realized that marketers are more interested in conversions and action taken within apps. So Facebook said it’s now going to be emphasizing value-based app ads products instead. Since 2012, mobile app install ads have been available on Facebook. As the name implies, the goal is to market an app to you and get you to install it on your device. Think of it like Google AdWords, but specifically geared toward developers looking to market their work. And Facebook and Google have been vocal about touting the success of their respective platforms in an effort to curry favor with developers. In August, Google announced that its service helped drive 3 billion app installs in 2016, while Facebook had 2 billion. As for where things currently stand, Facebook declined to comment, but a source told VentureBeat that the company is seeing an uptick in activity, with the total number of installs “doubling” in the last year, which could make the number around 4 billion. Even if the social media company is shifting away from focusing on total installs, it’s not abandoning developers who see user acquisition as their primary goal. “If you’re a newer or emerging app business, the portfolio of products we have to drive installs is robust. Whether through targeting, creative, inventory, or measurement tools, there’s a lot of options if that’s the state you’re in,” said Christine De Martini, Facebook’s product marketing lead for customer acquisitions. She described the current environment as akin to a Where’s Waldo? in that developers who are looking to promote their app often find it difficult to locate the right person. “How do you cut through and make sure your app is installed by the right person that will find value in the app and return?” De Martini asked, while pointing to a statistic stating that after 30 days only 6 percent of users are retained. “In thinking about growth trends, we need to do our part to maximize the opportunity so we can [help developers] grow their business with the right customers,” she said. “It’s very common now for revenue to come from purchases, engagement within apps where you’re served ads or [do actions] post-install. Revenue is now coming from post-install models.” According to De Martini, most developers today are measuring performance by revenue, not by install count. With billions of installs driven, it’s clear that Facebook and Google have at least achieved critical mass and both are forces of nature when it comes to app marketing. But instead of engaging in a tit-for-tat with competitors over whose metric is bigger, Facebook is electing to take the high road and believes the industry will benefit if there’s a push toward action-oriented solutions. And Facebook has the pull to make this change — it revealed that 80 of the top 100 apps in the Google Play and App Store are using what it calls its “value-based ad products.” One of these products is app event optimization, which launched in 2016 across Facebook, Instagram, and participants in the Audience Network. Developers and advertisers can use this tool to deliver their mobile app install ads to those who are “likely to take valuable actions within their apps,” such as adding an item to their shopping cart, making a purchase, or completing a level. Above: Example of creative value-based ads by Scopely and Jet.com on Facebook. Image Credit: Facebook Eric Ma, vice president of user acquisition for gaming company Scopely, said in a statement: “…We’ve continued to generate profitable growth leveraging Facebook’s optimization to valuable downstream actions such as purchases, instead of just installs. Since we adopted App Event Optimization, we have seen a 50 percent increase in our Return on Ad Spend within the first seven days post install.” De Martini also highlighted worldwide targeting and app remarketing as two other tools available to advertisers. The former was introduced last year for app developers looking to expand into other countries and wanting to find similar audiences. Facebook says that worldwide targeting makes it easier to find lookalike users across multiple countries simultaneously, eliminating overhead and time spent researching. With app remarketing, developers want ways to re-engage those who may have installed their app but then let it fall by the wayside. This tool will reach out to app users based on any actions they may have taken or not taken, encouraging them to give the app one more shot. “We believe focus is bringing people to value,” De Martini said. She described the industry as reaching a point of critical mass and undergoing an evolution, moving from installs to pushing conversion and action-based marketing. “It’s what developers are asking for. We see an opportunity to be a leader in the space…84 percent [of app developers] are focused on revenue.” With Facebook’s transition away from touting aggregate install numbers on its platform, eyes will likely shift to what’s next. After all, advertisers, developers, and even investors will be wondering what metrics, numbers, and tools the company will parade out to reinforce its momentum. De Martini declined to share future plans, except to say: “I’m excited about the potential of the value focus. We’re planning to extend the approach to other direct response [products].” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.
Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 17 April 2017 by Military News Burger King hacks Google Home devices to market its Whopper Burger King recently tweeted this: The key to success is believing in yourself. Especially when you want a Whopper. — Burger King (@BurgerKing) April 12, 2017 It turns out the same advice applies when you want your brand’s name splashed across headlines and social media sites. On Wednesday, the fast-food chain launched this commercial: [embedded content] Owners of Google Home devices who saw the ad then got an unwelcome surprise. The New York Times reported: Prompted by the phrase “O.K. Google,” the Google Home device beside the TV in the video lit up, searched the phrase on Wikipedia and stated the ingredients. But within hours of the ad’s release — and humorous edits to the Whopper Wikipedia page by mischievous users — tests from The Verge and BuzzFeed showed that the commercial had stopped activating the device. The stunt lasted for only a few hours before Google blocked the commercial from activating its device—but within that time, many social media users turned to Wikipedia to edit the product’sdescription, forcing the site’s administrators to lock down the entry. The New York Times reported: Burger King, which did not work with Google on the ad, said Google appeared to make changes by Wednesday afternoon that stopped the commercial from waking the devices, in what amounted to an unusual form of corporate warfare in the living room. Google, which previously said it had not been consulted on the campaign, did not respond to requests for comment. The move was a novel (if invasive) idea from Burger King’s marketing team—and not just because it used technology in a new way. [RELATED: Attend the Practical PR Summit and transform your PR skills to become more successful in the new media landscape.] “The media, not your Google Home, has been hacked by Burger King,” The Verge’s James Bareham wrote. He then explained that most consumers with Google Home devices are the younger demographic who are early adopters. The percentage of them who also watch traditional TV—and who could have been affected by the commercial—is tiny. The cadre of people sharing news about Burger King’s stunt, however, is not. Bareham wrote: It appears that its aim was to create a commercial that would tap into the target demographic’s concerns for intrusive advertising and invasion of their privacy. In turn, this would grab the attention of digital and traditional media who would write about those issues at length and generate tens of millions of dollars of free media and bucket loads of engagement. In that vein, Burger King’s campaign is a stunning success. It even managed to get around Google’s hasty block from letting the ad trigger Google Homes by releasing an alternate version during the prime-time slot it bought. Fortune’s Jeff John Roberts agreed that “the whole episode was likely a stunt to gin up free publicity,” but he pointed out that marketing gimmicks such as this might become more common as more consumers buy smart devices for their homes. Roberts wrote: … But it also raises the question of what’s to stop another company from trying the same thing—using a TV or radio ad to force a Google Home or an Echo (Amazon’s competing device) to be co-opted into their marketing. The answer, from a legal perspective, appears to be that nothing can stop them. „Google (and others) literally “opened the door” to this new hack when they put ‚always on’ devices in the home. We warned the FTC of the basic flaw in the architecture — it is not simply the owner that activates the device … They didn’t ‚listen,'” Marc Rotenberg, the president of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told Fortune by email.

The agreement was announced Monday by Alexei Dostenko, deputy head of Russia's Federal Anti-Monopoly Service, according to Russian news reports. Under the settlement, Google is to pay 439 million rubles ($7.8 million) in fines and will not limit the pre-installation of third-party apps, the reports said. The case was brought to the FAS in 2015 by Yandex, which is Russia's dominant search engine and offers various apps including a popular one for ordering taxis. Yandex's shares surged 6 percent on the Moscow stock exchange after the settlement was announced.

The crux of the complaint, which was initiated by Russian internet giant Yandex, was that Google was abusing its dominant market position and was breaking anti-competition legislation. Essentially, the argument was that Google was preventing third-party companies from offering competing services on Android by forcing manufacturers to bundle some Google apps, including Gmail, Google Search, and Google Play, on the devices. While it’s true that manufacturers are free to use Android without the aforementioned apps installed, as Amazon does with the Kindle Fire tablet, if a phone company wishes to offer one Google service, it has to offer them all. For example, if a handset maker wanted to offer users the Google Play app store, they would also have to offer Google Maps, Gmail, and Google Search. And it was the latter that irked Yandex, given that it runs its own popular search service in Russia. In March of last year, the Moscow Arbitration court upheld a previous ruling from FAS that found Google was indeed abusing its market position. Google was later fined almost $7 million and was ordered to change its agreement with device makers. Now Google said it has entered a commercial agreement with Yandex to “promote” Yandex in Chrome — a deal that has been rubberstamped by the FAS. As part of the deal, Google will no longer “demand exclusivity of its applications on Android-based devices in Russia,” according to a separate statement issued by the FAS. It said: Google will be obliged not to restrict pre-installation of any competing search engines and applications (including on the default home screen); Google will refrain from stimulating pre-installation of the Google search as the only general search engine; Google will no longer enforce the parts of the previously signed agreements that contradict to the terms of the settlement; finally, Google will be committed to securing the rights of the third parties to include their search engines into the choice window. Moving forward, the FAS says that Google will build an “active choice” window for its Chrome browser that will offer existing Android users in Russia the choice to select a different default search engine. This will be deployed through an over-the-air (OTA) software update. Additionally, Google will build a new Chrome widget to replace the existing Google Search widget that millions of users around the world will be familiar with. When Chrome is launched for the first time, users will see an option to choose Yandex search or Google search. Other search engine providers who enter into a commercial agreement with Google will also be made available here. In an open letter posted by its CEO, Arkady Volozh, Yandex calls the agreement a “celebration of choice.” He said: As one of the largest internet companies in Europe, and the leading search and mobile applications provider in Russia, access to platforms is critically important for Yandex. Technology platforms make it possible for us (as well as other companies) to continue a rapid pace of innovation. But this is only possible if those platforms are sufficiently open to foster competition by allowing access to third-party developers. We are excited to have reached a solution that restores these necessary elements to ensure a more dynamic and competitive ecosystem. This is a major development for Android in Russia, but it could also spill out into other regions. Google’s Android anticompetition woes extend into the European Union (EU) with the European Commission (EC) also probing the internet giant on similar grounds. That Russia has managed to get Google to commit to opening Android up could set a precedent and give other legislative bodies more confidence in their push against Google.

One of them is called "Boost Views," and was downloaded by up to 100,000 users. It promises users that they will earn money if they watch YouTube content via the app. It also offers to increase traffic to someone's YouTube account in exchange for purchasing credits.  Users who use the app are invited to enter their PayPal details into an "authentication form." However, on doing so, they will find no earnings deposited in their account. Even worse, some people who downloaded the app complained that it had taken money from their account. Another malicious app is called PaxVendor, which works by pretending to have a connection to the legitimate Bitcoin trading marketplace Paxful. PaxVendor, which doesn't offer users any functions of its own, uses a bogus login screen to harvest Paxful credentials.  © Photo: Pixabay CIA Unmasked as 'Very Dangerous' Longhorn Group Hacking Governments WorldwideWhen it launches, it instructs users to disable Google authorization or SMS authorization in their Paxful account in order to avoid potential two-factor authentication obstacles, ESET reported. The scam program was installed up to 500 times in the space of a week, before ESET informed Google Play and PaxVendor was pulled from the online store. Last week a study by Google and the University of California, San Diego reported that scammers are using Google Maps to defraud internet users searching for local listings. By taking an existing address and registering it with the US Postal Service, they created a fake listing which they used to provide an overpriced or non-existent service to customers.  At least 40 percent of the listings involved the on-call service industry. Locksmiths, plumbers and electricians would give a lower price over the phone and significantly increase the cost when they responded to the call. ...

The settlement, announced Monday, ends a nearly two-year investigation by FAS into Google's control of the Android operating system. FAS had accused Google of abusing its monopoly position in mobile app stores serving the Android operating system. The fine amounts to 9 percent of Google's revenue in Russia in 2014, plus inflation, according to TASS. Russian search engine provider Yandex filed the original complaint against Google. Google representatives didn't immediately respond to requests for comments on the settlement. Under the settlement, Google cannot stop smartphone makers from pre-installing competing search engine apps on their devices. For smartphones already sold to Russian residents, Google will develop a pop-up window in the Chrome browser that allows users to change their default browser, FAS said. Google will also develop a new widget for Chrome that will allow buyers of new devices to choose their default search engine, FAS said. "Implementation of the settlement's terms will be an effective means to secure competition between developers of mobile applications,"Â Igor Artemiev, head of the FAS, said in a statement. "We managed to find a balance between the necessity to develop the Android ecosystem and interests of third-party developers for promoting their mobile applications and services on Android-based devices."

Users of the app will no longer be able to make revisions to the map database or suggest edits, Mirror Online reports. The function, which had been in place since 2008, allowed maps to be updated with local knowledge such as when building changes were made. Unsurprisingly, this meant that the function fell victim to pranksters and all suggestions then had to be moderated. One of Google Maps' most popular features has been axed The task of moderating all new suggestions was too large for Google Maps to handle, so they have scrapped the function. In a statement to Mirror Online, a Google spokesperson said: "Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience. "To make it easier for all Google Maps users to contribute changes to the map, we've started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile. "We'll continue to add new editing features within Google Maps on an ongoing basis. "To keep contributing your local knowledge to Google Maps and engage with a passionate community of like-minded individuals, we invite you to join the Local Guides programme."

About Future Resources Staff Contact Privacy Policy Search for: Select Press Releases Home / Press Releases / Pinning Down Abuse On Google Maps Pinning Down Abuse On Google Maps Posted on April 17, 2017 by Benzinga Full Feed in Press Releases Leadership is an overused word, and is often misused. We like this definition. Locksmiths of America present the definitive ways to avoid scammers posing as locksmiths. Washington DC (PRWEB) April 17, 2017 A research paper by the University of California titled, “Pinning Down Abuse On Google Maps,” funded by a grant of 4.97 million dollars from the National Science Foundation, documents the extent we are exposed to misinformation on the Internet. This information can be in the form of a false address, fake map points, untrue claims all which could mislead the consumer. Many unscrupulous companies use these illegal techniques to gain a prominent listing. False listings can totally fool a consumer as they entice the consumer by suggesting a nearby false location, cheap prices, and even mimicking an existing reputable well-known service. This can create many unhappy customers left with poor workmanship and high costs once this locksmith arrives. The other huge impact is loss of business of service calls diverted from honest locksmiths who abide by the guidelines created by the search engines. “In this paper, we investigate a new form of blackhat search engine optimization that targets local listing services like Google Maps. Miscreants register abusive business listings in an attempt to siphon search traffic away from legitimate businesses and funnel it to deceptive service industries—such as unaccredited locksmiths—or to traffic-referral scams, often for the restaurant and hotel industry.” “Users’ online attention is becoming increasingly localized: A recent Google study [1] reports that 4 out of 5 users conduct searches with local intent. A wide variety of local listing services like Apple and Google Maps, Yelp, and Foursquare have emerged to enable users to search for businesses based on physical location. Hence, relevance is no longer sufficient to drive interest; geographical proximity is the coin of the emerging localized-search realm.” “However, increasing economic incentives are driving an ecosystem of deceptive business practices that exploit-localized search, such as illegal locksmiths that extort victims into paying for inferior services [9]. In response, local listing services like Google Maps employ increasingly sophisticated verification mechanisms to try and prevent fraudulent listings from appearing on their services.” The problem of identification So how do you avoid these scamming locksmith companies? They know how to disguise themselves as a legitimate business. Their web sites look professional, plus they gain a legitimacy provided by the search engines and online directories enhancements. Some are a prominent placement on their first page, a beautiful map listing and many times they allow a manufactured five star reviews to blend their listings with others perfectly. Remove the false listings. The locksmith trade accounts for 25% of all bad listings according to the study. “In collaboration with Google, we examined over a hundred-thousand business listings that appeared on Google Maps between June 1, 2014 and September 30, 2015 that were subsequently suspended for abuse.” So it can be done. Search Engines and Online directories can remove the bad listings before they are seen. The search engines and online directories have a responsibility to validate listings before they place them as a resource for the consumer. They are a for profit organization (Google made approximately 55 Billion in revenue last year). So, one would think they would want their information to be accurate. Techniques to detect false listings Hire a real person(s) to validate listings. Do not use algorithms. They don’t work, but real people can analyze all problematic categories with no trouble. Are they registered with the state corporation commission and the state tax department? Are they truly licensed in the states that have locksmith licenses? You can check online at the state web sites. Check the address they say they are located – if they have no affiliation with that address. Do a reverse search see what appears at that address. Call the business or one next-door see if the address checks out that way. If not legit send their web page to the back pages and please don’t give them a pinpoint position on the map. Call the company directly. A quick trick to find out the truth call the locksmith: ask if you can come by and get a house key duplicated. If the response is something like "We're a dispatch point," they just might be a scammer as they definitely have no affiliation with that address; lie number one. Mobile locksmiths may have a service area but not an address if not true. What can the consumer do? Many times they can’t tell real from false. It’s not their fault. The listings are so well disguised there is no way to note a difference on first glance. The consumer can use the same methods as mentioned to check out the company to see if it is presenting false information, if found to be lying then there is a high probability good things will not follow. But you can try. It takes time and is difficult to do without resources as the search engine who placed them there to begin with. So be sure to suggest to your search engine they police their publication. It benefits all; the consumer, legit service companies, and the reputation and honor of the search engine. Good luck and let's fix this problem together.

We’ve become accustomed to Google adding features and interface tweaks to constantly improve the Photos app, but over the weekend it might have seemed like one of the most-used features was being changed for the worse. But rest assured, it’s just a bug and Google is already working on squashing it. Over on the Google Photos support forum, numerous users have noted that their People albums aren’t quite as populated as they once were. According to the posters, the problem wasn’t affecting the actual photos themselves, but rather how the algorithm sorted them. When they went into the automatically generated People folder to find collected pictures of their friends and kids, either new photos weren’t added into their existing album or they were sorted into a completely new one. And in some case, albums that were there disappeared. The problem seems to affect all instances of Google Photos, across iOS and Android apps, and the web. At first Google moderators suggested checking the Face grouping toggle in settings, but an employee quickly chimed in to set the record straight. According to Ben, a Google Photos community manager, Google is “aware of this and our team is looking into it.” He promised to post more information in the various affected threads when it's been fixed. The problem seems to be fairly limited in scope, but if you’re one of the affected users, stay tuned to the Google Photos forum for updates. The big picture: Bugs and issues are a fact of life of apps, especially when you’re dealing with millions of users and countless files, but this is a fairly benign one. Thankfully, no photos seem to have been damaged or wiped out due to the issue, and it's mainly a matter of convenience. Still, though, Google is handling it the right way by admitting there is a problem and promising a hopefully speedy fix.
