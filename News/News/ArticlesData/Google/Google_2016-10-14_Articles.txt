So much so, Google is now rewarding organisations and media outlets that produce the debunking content. ADVERTISEMENT Articles appearing in Google News that meet the search giant's definition of checking facts will now display a small tag saying this is the case. "You’ll see the tagged articles in the expanded story box on news.google.com and in the Google News and Weather iOS and Android apps, starting with the US and the UK," the Silicon Valley firm said in a blog post. Read more WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for November 11 WIRED Awake: 10 must-read articles for November 11 By WIRED The 'Fact Check' label will join the 'In-Depth', 'Opinion', and 'Wikipedia' tags that are currently used by Google to differentiate between articles. The company has used the tags to show "diversity of content" since 2007. When Google first started tagging articles in this way, it said: "We've heard from some of our users that the way we displayed these blogs in Google News was not very clear". The move to highlight fact checking is no different. "We’ve heard that many readers enjoy having easy access to a diverse range of content types". ADVERTISEMENT Google isn't arbitrarily deciding which websites count as fact checkers though. "Google News determines whether an article might contain fact checks in part by looking for the schema.org ClaimReview markup," it explained. The Schema is a community-decided set of data and structure that indicates a set standard needed to classify as a fact-checking site.

From Google Daydream to Google Assistant and more, here are the Android OS perks exclusive to the Pixel flagship phones.  ( Ramin Talaie | Getty Images ) Advertisement While most Android devices will soon operate on the upcoming Android 7.1 Nougat, only the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones will run the full range of features that the new OS offers. Even Google's previous line of Nexus devices won't enjoy the upgrade as extensively as the company's new signature models will. And this just serves to heighten the unique appeal of the Pixel line. Here are the features exclusive to Android 7.1 Nougat for the Google Pixel flagship smartphones: Google Daydream VR The Pixel and Pixel XL are, in no small way, "phones built for virtual reality," according to Google. Being the first two to support Google's VR platform Daydream, the flagship devices will allow for an immersive 3D experience of movies, concerts and sporting events as though Pixel users were physically there. Daydream on Android 7.1 Nougat will also let them play games and explore new worlds. The Pixel phones will work with the Daydream View VR headset. Google Assistant Like the voice-activated Google Now, the new Google Assistant uses natural language commands. With an ability to understand nuances in communication, such as followup questions and humorous jabs, however, Google Assistant is touted as smarter and snazzier than Google Now. The new personal assistant can also make sense of items displayed on-screen to help users sort through their schedule and tasks, and conveniently launch third-party apps. To use Google Assistant on the Pixel smartphone, simply press down on the Home Button and say "OK Google" and the interface will switch to speech bubbles showing the conversation. Google Assistant may officially be exclusive to the Pixel smartphones, but that hasn't stopped other developers from editing into non-Pixel phones for these to run Google Assistant too.  Pixel Camera App With Unlimited Photo, Video Storage One of the highly celebrated features of the Google Pixel flagships is their camera — rated the best smartphone camera in the mobile phone industry thus far. The Pixel phones are equipped with a slew of camera tricks, which are embedded in the Pixel Camera app designed specifically for the devices. Among the Pixel Camera app features supported on Android 7.1 Nougat are Smart Burst, which is said to use artificial intelligence to choose the best out of a series of shots, and the default HDR+, which promises "zero shutter lag" even when taking rapid fire shots. The Smart Burst mode is not entirely a novel feature since it was included in the Nexus 6P last year, but Android 7.1 on the Pixel phones will carry the latest and greatest version. Retaining their original quality, photos and videos taken on Pixel phones will be safely stored on Google Photos without limit. Smart Storage Because the Pixel phones do not allow for memory expansion via a microSD card, the system will automatically remove photos and videos already saved in the Google Photos cloud storage. Pixel Launcher After having been renamed from Nexus Launcher to Pixel Launcher, the unique homescreen will (for now at least) be exclusive to the eponymous Pixel line. Google may, however, consider eventually porting it to Nexus devices, as some reports suggest. The main features we know so far: the Pixel Launcher will include new homescreen shortcuts and the circular app icons, and will also have users swiping up to access the app drawer from favorites. Customer Support 24/7 Google Pixel device owners who may run into a glitch can easily ask for assistance anytime — all thanks to the company's 24/7 customer support. From the Settings app, users can either text or call the help desk, and even share their screen with the customer assistant when walking through processes step by step. Android 7.1 Nougat Beta Release The new Android 7.1 Nougat firmware is included in the Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones out of the box when the devices are released starting on Oct. 20. But the latest version of Nougat will also be released in beta for the Nexus line and other Android devices at the end of October.

Home Computing Digital Life Discovery Space Innovation Health Science News Environment Automotive Tech You are here: Home / Mobile Apps / Robots Can Organize Your Photos Certifications that stand out Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Robots Organize Your Photos, So You Can Procrastinate By Anick Jesdanun PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 15 2016 If you're like many people, you have thousands of photos on your phone, long forgotten after you've posted a few on Instagram or Facebook. They don't have to stay forgotten. Apple and Google are both applying a form of artificial intelligence called "machine learning" to organize your pictures and video -- and along the way, help you rediscover last year's vacation, dinner with close friends and a casual summer outing to the park. Apple's tools are part of last month's iOS 10 system update for iPhones and iPads. The Google Photos app for Apple and Android devices has a digital assistant to automatically organize these memories -- and Google signaled last week that it will only get smarter. And on Wednesday, Google introduced additional features for rediscovery. Here's a look at how they take you down memory lane: Apple's Memories Apple's new Memories feature automatically generates video highlights around a theme, such as a trip or birthday party. Individual photos and snippets from video are chosen for you, as is the music, though you can change it to reflect a different mood. This isn't just a slideshow. There's slow zooming and panning, reminiscent of Ken Burns historical documentaries. Some of the photos also come to life, at least on newer iPhones that automatically take three seconds of video with every photo. When you're ready to share, the app creates a standard movie file -- so it works on Windows and Android devices, too. For me, Apple's app created a "Florida to Illinois" package for a three-week trip in January and one for a day trip to Philadelphia last November. But Apple goes beyond date and location. Apple created a "Together" package for shots with family over the past two years. It also created an "At The Beach" package with beach photos since 2013. Other scenic themes could include mountains, lakes and sunsets. Apple offers up to three new Memories a day. You can create more based on photos you add to an album and generate new automated ones by scrolling down to "Related." You can also add or delete images within Memories -- in my experience, a few included mundane screenshots I had to get rid of. Nothing will ever replace the human touch. But let's face it, even though I keep meaning to organize my photos, I never find the time. The machine-generated selections aren't necessarily ones I'd choose myself, but with a small amount of tweaking, they're presentable and will tide me over until I get around to catching up manually ... someday. Google's Assistant Google Photos has been at this longer and offers more types of packages. With collages, Google combines smaller versions of several shots into one layout . Animations combine a bunch of photos taken in succession so that they resemble as a moving image . Unlike typical "GIF" animation files, Google applies its magic to align successive shots, so buildings and bridges look steady -- without the shake common with handheld video. Google also offers albums and video highlights, though without the Ken Burns effect. Google's Assistant generates much of this for you automatically. You can edit auto-generated albums and video highlights, but not collages or animation -- although you can create your own from scratch. (That does defeat the purpose of letting the robots do the work, though.) Sharing is easy and doesn't require recipients to have Google Photos. The results vary in quality. I tend to take several shots of the same subject, just in case some are blurry. Yet I get collages and animations out of those repetitive shots. The albums and video highlights I got are grouped by location and date, though Google says it will be doing more with themes , such as following a kid growing up. Most of my computer-generated creations are animations and collages. As with Apple, Google's choices aren't necessarily ones I'd make, if only I had the time. But some are good enough that I look forward to alerts for new ones to check out. I also enjoyed a feature called "Rediscover this day." Google will automatically create collages from shots taken on a day, say, two years ago. On Wednesday, Google said it will apply that to people, too, so you'll get collages of you with a specific friend or family member. Searching Apple and Google are both getting better at image recognition. Apple's version tends to be more conservative. While Apple found four photos in a search for fireworks, Google found dozens. Google also found more photos with hats, though one was actually a strange hairdo and a few were of a headband. Then again, Apple thought an illustration of a hut was a hat. Google is also bolder with face recognition. Its technology is smart enough to recognize the same child at 2 months and 6 years, while Apple often separates the same child into multiple identities (you can merge them, and things will be fine after that). Google has an edge over Apple in part because it taps its powerful servers to process photos. Apple leaves all the machine thinking to your device as a privacy measure. But Apple says it also favors being right more than complete to reduce the work people need to do to fix things. Being wrong can also have consequences: Google had to apologize last year after its software got too aggressive and mistakenly labeled two black people as gorillas. Storage To free up space, both services will automatically clear photos from your phone after uploading them to the internet, once you activate the option. You still have a lower-resolution version on the device and can get the sharper image anytime, as long as you're online. Google Photos offers unlimited online storage of photos at up to 16 megapixels and videos at 1080p high definition -- good enough for most people. It will compress larger photos, or you can store the original and have it count toward your Google Drive limit, which starts at 15 gigabytes for free. Apple's iCloud Photo Library requires paying once you exceed 5 gigabytes, which is enough for a few thousand photos. © 2016 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Google’s new “Fact check” tag — which joins other categories the search giant uses to distinguish certain posts within the endless sea of internet content such as “Highly Cited” and “Opinion” — aims “to help readers find fact checking in large news stories,” according to a blog post. In the post, Google Head of News Richard Gingras explained some of the logic in determining which stories get the “Fact check” tag. Also Read: Donald Trump Says Google Is 'Suppressing' Negative Hillary Clinton News “Google News determines whether an article might contain fact checks in part by looking for the schema.org ClaimReview markup,” he wrote. “We also look for sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” Google already uses algorithms to give certain sources preference in its search rankings, which drives a significant percentage of total internet traffic. However, the company hasn’t previously called out false news stories in any way or appeared to make overt political judgments, although Donald Trump has accused the search engine of “suppressing” bad news about Hillary Clinton. var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); Earlier this year, former Facebook employees admitted that human curators deliberately prevented news from right-wing sources from trending in its News Feed Also Read: Jon Voight Backs Donald Trump's Google Conspiracy Theory (Video) “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Gingras wrote.

Foreign spies hacked Australian agency, report says by Staff Writers Sydney (AFP) Oct 12, 2016 Government data requests up 10 percent: Google Washington (AFP) Oct 12, 2016 - Google said Wednesday that data requests from governments around the world hit a record high in the six months ending in June, extending a steady rise. The 44,943 requests amounted to a 10 percent increase from the prior six-month period and a fourth consecutive increase, Google said in its "transparency report." The official requests related to 76,713 user accounts in the latest period, down from 81,311 in the second half of 2015. Google provided at least some data in response to 64 percent of the requests in 2016, unchanged from the previous reporting period. The number of requests to Google has been generally rising since it began releasing transparency data in 2011. The online giant, like other tech firms, maintains that it protects user privacy while cooperating with lawful requests from police and other official agencies. "As we have noted in the past, when we receive a request for user information, we review it carefully and only provide information within the scope and authority of the request," Google law enforcement director Richard Salgado said in a blog post. "Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law, for example to compel us to disclose content in criminal cases we require the government use a search warrant, and that it complies with Google's strict policies (to prevent overreach that can compromise users' privacy)." In the latest report, the United States had the largest number of requests at 14,169, with data supplied in 79 percent of those cases. Germany was second with 8,788 requests, followed by France (4,300), India (3,452) and Britain (3,302). The company said it received its first-ever requests from Algeria, Belarus, the Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Fiji and Saudi Arabia in 2016. Google did not agree to provide data in any of those requests, according to the report. Foreign spies installed malicious software on an Australian government agency's computer system, stealing an unknown number of documents, an official report revealed Wednesday, stopping short of naming the country involved. The security breach on the Bureau of Meteorology's system, which has connections to the defence department, was detected in 2015 and initial media reports linked it to China. China has previously been accused of hacking websites run by the US government and by private firms. In 2013 Chinese hackers were accused of stealing the top-secret blueprints of Australia's new intelligence agency headquarters. The government's Australian Cyber Security Centre report released Wednesday attributed "the primary compromise to a foreign intelligence service" but did not name any country as responsible. "We don't narrow it down to specific countries, and we do that deliberately," said Dan Tehan, who assists Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on cyber security. "But what we have indicated is that cyber espionage is alive and well," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The report said the national cyber security agency, Australian Signals Directorate (ASD), had identified the presence of Remote Access Tool (RAT) malware "popular with state-sponsored cyber adversaries" and other malware associated with cyber crime on the weather bureau's system in 2015. "The RAT had also been used to compromise other Australian government networks," it said. "ASD identified evidence of the adversary searching for and copying an unknown quantity of documents from the Bureau's network. This information is likely to have been stolen by the adversary." The report also said while the threat of a cyber attack against Australia's government, infrastructure and industry had grown in recent years, the risk from terrorist groups was low for now. "Apart from demonstrating a savvy understanding of social media and exploiting the internet for propaganda purposes, terrorist cyber capabilities generally remain rudimentary and show few signs of improving significantly in the near future," it said.

A fact-check feature will appear as a tag among Google news search results, alongside established labels for "highly cited," "in-depth" and "opinion." Sites deemed nonpartisan and meeting the criterion of a fact-checking service can apply for the label. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Google said in a blog post Friday. No shortage of claims and counter-claims have plagued the veracity of comments on a wide range of issues in the general election pitting Hillary Clinton against Donald Trump. Most major media outlets now routinely run short, fact-checking features and some networks, such as CNN, parenthetically insert headlines verifying or challenging a candidate's claims. For Google, which has tinkered with the idea for years, it's been "an ambition of the founders to be able to provide instant access to facts to respond to statements or claims being made by politicians and public figures," says Greg Sterling, a contributing editor at Search Engine Land. Facebook, which holds considerable sway in how Americans receive their news, has yet to employ a fact-checking feature. The social-networking giant recently landed itself in hot water when its algorithm promoted fake news. Follow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.

Julian Chokkattu Digital TrendsOctober 15, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google unveiled a slew of devices at its October 4 event, and two of them are smartphones — the Pixel and Pixel XL. You can pre-order both devices right now (if they’re in stock) and they’ll be available on October 20. The smartphone market is saturated with big displays, but those who want smaller handsets usually must settle for budget or mid-tier specifications. There are exceptions, of course, like the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact and the iPhone SE, but flagship small smartphones are few and far between. Related: Pixel phones, Daydream, Home — Oh my! Everything Google revealed at its Oct. 4 event In comes Google’s Pixel, which shares nearly the exact same specifications as the bigger Pixel XL while retaining a 5-inch display. Last year’s 5.2-inch Nexus 5X was not nearly as powerful as the Nexus 6P, and that’s why it had a lower price tag. With the Pixel, you can finally expect flagship specs on a small display. You’re also getting the very best of Android — and near perfect hardware and software integration. Unlike the Nexus lineup, Google handpicked specific parts from HTC — like how Apple uses Foxconn to manufacture the iPhone. Tighter integration between Android OS and the hardware can make all the difference. Below is our breakdown and analysis of the Nexus 5X and the Pixel, which can help you decide if you should cough up the dough to join Google’s new lineup. Performance Google Pixel Nexus 5X Size 143.8 × 69.5 × 7.3mm (5.61 x 2.74 x 0.31 inches) 147 x 72.6 x 7.9mm (5.79 x 2.86 x 0.31 inches) Weight 5.04 ounces (143 grams) 4.80 ounces (135 grams) Screen 5-inch AMOLED 5.2-inch IPS LCD Resolution 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (441 ppi) 1,920 x 1,080 pixels (423 ppi) OS Android 7.1 Android 7.0 (upgradeable to Android 7.1) Storage 32, 128GB 16, 32GB MicroSD card slot No No NFC support Yes Yes Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 RAM 4GB 2GB Connectivity 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi 4G LTE, GSM, CDMA, HSPA+, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Camera 12.3MP rear, 8MP front 12.3MP rear, 5MP front Video 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 120, 60 or 30fps, 720p at 240fps 4K at 30fps, 1080p at 30fps, 720p at 120fps Bluetooth Yes, version 4.2 Yes, version 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Other sensors Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor Barometer, gyro, accelerometer, proximity sensor Water resistant Yes, IP53 rated No Battery 2,770mAh 2,700mAh Ports USB Type-C USB Type-C Marketplace Google Store Google Store Color offerings Blue, silver, black Black, white, blue Availability AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile, Project Fi Price $650 $350~ DT review Pending – Hands on here 2.5/5 stars It may look like the Pixel and the Nexus 5X share similar specs — they do, but the Pixel has a leg up where it really matters. Notably, it comes with the latest and greatest from Qualcomm — the Snapdragon 821. This processor supposedly offers a 10 percent increase in performance over the Snapdragon 820, which powered most of this year’s flagships, such as Samsung’s Galaxy S7 Edge, the LG G5, and the HTC 10. In comparison, the Pixel is well ahead of the Snapdragon 808 processor in the Nexus 5X. You won’t have issues with daily tasks like web browsing, but you will see performance hiccups when doing slightly processor-heavy tasks, like playing Pokémon Go. Not to mention the 5X only has 2GB of RAM — it truly shows when you try to multi-task with several apps. The Pixel has 4GB of RAM and it’s better optimized to run Android, so you shouldn’t run into any issues. The newer device also has better storage options, offering a standard 32GB and a 128GB model, whereas the 5X only comes with options for 16GB and 32GB of internal storage. Both devices also feature a fingerprint sensor. Winner: Pixel Design and durability Google’s latest phone is slightly smaller than the 5.2-inch Nexus 5X, but it’s also a little heavier — that’s thanks to the all-metal build, making the Pixel feel like a high-end device. The 5X is made of hard polymer plastic. Metal is better, but half of the Pixel’s back is glass, which may not make it as durable as the 5X — that’s double the glass you may have to repair. And the glass back is one of the more unique design choices for the Pixel, which mostly looks like an iPhone. The glass is sure to attract fingerprints, but we’re not fans of the front due to the larger-than-usual bottom bezel. The Nexus 5X, on the other hand, has slim bezels, a sleek back with the stylish Nexus brand name, and a front-facing speaker — though it’s not too powerful. The Pixel’s speaker will likely be a little louder, even if there’s only a single, bottom-firing one. Design is subjective, and we like the Pixel’s look but the Nexus 5X may edge out here. The metal build may also protect your Pixel a little more, but the glass on the back is has us worried that you may face a higher repair cost if you drop the device. Winner: Nexus 5X  Display The Pixel’s 5-inch display still holds the same resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, but it has a higher pixel density at 441 pixels-per-inch — you will hardly be able to tell the difference. What will be easily noticeable is the screen as the Pixel has an AMOLED display, and the Nexus 5X uses an LCD one. The Pixel’s screen will likely be brighter and offer deeper blacks, as well as sharper colors. Winner: Pixel Battery The Pixel XL may feature a sizable difference in battery capacity, but that doesn’t mean the Pixel won’t be able to last you a day. Google claims the Pixel will give you up to 13 hours of internet use on LTE — that’s the same as Apple’s claim for the iPhone 7 Plus, and an hour more than the iPhone 7. Read More Compared to the Nexus 5X, you’ll get five more hours of battery life using internet on LTE with the Pixel. It’s surprising, considering the two have similar batteries. The Pixel has a 2,770mAh battery and the 5X has a 2,700mAh one. The key is software and hardware optimization, and while we doubt we’ll actually get 13 hours of internet use on LTE for the Pixel, you can certainly expect a sizable bump of juice for the device. Winner: Pixel Camera Google’s proud of what it’s done with the Pixel’s camera — it has received the highest score on DXOMark for a smartphone. Google says it rebuilt the experience from the ground up — there’s no optical-image-stabilization, but the search giant has a proprietary gyro-based stabilization software for videos. Google has also improved HDR+ processing, meaning the photo is captured much faster and it also processes incredibly fast. Not to mention that Google says its 12.3-megapixel rear camera on the Pixel has one of the fastest launch to capture times. Compared to the Nexus 5X, we can say this is true thanks to our brief time with the devices at the San Francisco event. The camera on the Pixel also has a few exclusive features, such as white balance presets, exposure compensation, automatic exposure and automatic focus locking, and viewfinder grid modes. If you own a Pixel, you’ll also get free unlimited photo storage in Google Photos at full resolution. This option already exists in the app, but storing at full resolution will eat up Google account storage space for non-Pixel owners. The front-facing camera is packed with 8-megapixels, more than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Software The Nexus 5X will get Android 7.1 Nougat in December, but the Pixel comes with it pre-installed. That means Pixel owners will have early access to new features like Night Light, a night mode; App Shortcuts, similar to iOS’ 3D Touch; improved touch latency; fingerprint gestures that allow you to swipe down to bring down the notification drawer; Daydream VR support, and Seamless A/B Updates. And there are a few Pixel-exclusive features that Nexus 5X owners will not enjoy at all, notably Google Assistant. Press and hold the home button, and you’ll find Google Assistant come up, asking what you need help with. The Assistant can run search queries, order an Uber, and more. The feature may end up on Nexus phones as Google is “exploring” ways to implement it, but it’s unlikely it will come any time soon. There’s also Smart Storage, which automatically removes backed up photos from your device, and the Pixel Launcher won’t be available on the Play Store — there are ways to implement a similar look via third-party launchers, though. You also get 24/7 support built into the phone, complete with screen sharing in case you ever run into an issue. You can learn more about the differences between Android 7.1 Nougat in the Pixel and other Android devices here. Google’s Pixel smartphones are the future, so it’s certain they will endure longer-lasting support than the 5X. Winner: Pixel Pricing and availability The Pixel is a better phone, but we’re also comparing a device that has superior internals to one with mid-range specs. The Nexus 5X debuted for a little under $400, but you can easily find it online for prices ranging from $200 to $300. The Pixel, on the other hand, starts at $650 for the 32GB variant. Google’s asking for a lot more, but it does offer the specs, build, and optimization to match the high cost. The Nexus 5X isn’t sold on the Google Store anymore, but it’s still available from third-party retailers as well as on Project Fi. The Pixel is available for pre-order via Verizon, the Google Store, Best Buy, and Project Fi — you’ll be able to pay the full price or get on the device financing plan for no-interest monthly payments. It may be out of stock at the moment, though. Winner: Nexus 5X Winner: Pixel If you’re on a budget, there are more powerful smartphones you can get for a lower price than the Pixel, and the Nexus 5X is still a decent choice. You shouldn’t even be thinking about a Pixel, as it’s meant to be a high-end smartphone competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple. Still, no-interest device financing options are a plus and you’re getting the latest and greatest of Android, with fast updates and 24/7 support. You’re getting a superior camera, battery, display, vastly improved performance, and the kind of software and hardware integration we have never seen before on Android. What’s more enticing may be the fact that the Pixel may be one of the few high-performing 5-inch Android smartphones, and that’s certain to win over many of you.

The Nexus 5X debuted for a little under $400, but you can easily find it online for prices ranging from $200 to $300. The Pixel, on the other hand, starts at $650 for the 32GB variant. Google’s asking for a lot more, but it does offer the specs, build, and optimization to match the high cost. The Nexus 5X isn’t sold on the Google Store anymore, but it’s still available from third-party retailers as well as on Project Fi. The Pixel is available for pre-order via Verizon, the Google Store, Best Buy, and Project Fi — you’ll be able to pay the full price or get on the device financing plan for no-interest monthly payments. It may be out of stock at the moment, though. Winner: Nexus 5X Winner: Pixel If you’re on a budget, there are more powerful smartphones you can get for a lower price than the Pixel, and the Nexus 5X is still a decent choice. You shouldn’t even be thinking about a Pixel, as it’s meant to be a high-end smartphone competing with the likes of Samsung and Apple. Still, no-interest device financing options are a plus and you’re getting the latest and greatest of Android, with fast updates and 24/7 support. You’re getting a superior camera, battery, display, vastly improved performance, and the kind of software and hardware integration we have never seen before on Android. What’s more enticing may be the fact that the Pixel may be one of the few high-performing 5-inch Android smartphones, and that’s certain to win over many of you.

Rooting a phone lets you take more control over the software running on it, from loading apps that dig deeper into the settings of Android to running completely new operating systems altogether (such as the popular CyanogenMod). Unlocking and rooting comes with certain extra security risks and most people steer clear because it's not particularly easy to do. In the case of the Pixel and the Pixel XL, it should only take a few minutes with the right tools. I am root Have a look at the "root only" apps on the Android apps section of the Google Play Store to see what's possible with rooting: you can tweak battery and CPU performance, perform full phone backups, better control the file system and more. Most users won't ever need or want to unlock or root their phones but it's something advanced users and developers always look for, and another reason for those particular groups of people to go all in with Google's new pair of devices. The phones officially go on sale on 20 October: you can pick up the Pixel from $649/£599/AU$1,079 and the Pixel XL from $769/£719/AU$1,269 direct from Google. Stay tuned for our full reviews of both.

Mobile 25 0 0 October 15, 2016 HTC Bolt Specs: HTC 10 Look-Alike The Company’s First To Get Android 7.0 Nougat And To Ditch 3.5mm Headphone Jack? Venus Montalbo More details about the HTC Bolt specs are surfacing online. If the latest leaks and specs reports are to be trusted, this upcoming mid-range smartphone from the Taiwanese manufacturer will showcase more than one “first.” According to a report from Pocket-Lint, which cited an HTC ROM developer known as LlabTooFer, Bolt is going to be the first HTC-branded smartphone to run on Android 7.0 Nougat OS at launch. “You may think that the Google Pixel and Pixel XL actually claim that title since they’re probably being made by HTC too,” the post noted. “However there’s no actual HTC branding on those phones, so they don’t count. And, in fact, they go one better anyway, with Android 7.1.” HTC Bolt in silver. pic.twitter.com/vAFVInwnbc — Evan Blass (@evleaks) September 21, 2016 The ROM developer also shared that HTC Bolt, with alleged codename Acadia, will have Android Nougat, Google’s newest mobile OS iteration, together with Sense 8 UI that is also found on HTC 10, the tech conglomerate’s 2016 flagship device. In addition to having the same skin, it seems like HTC 10 and HTC Bolt will also share similarities in terms of form and appearance. The Bolt renders that recently showed up online revealed the same metal body, Pocket Lint also shared. When it comes to Bolt’s specs, the leaks also indicated that it may get a rear-facing camera with dual LED flash as well as a front-mounted fingerprint sensor. As for other possible specs, a Venture Beat post from the prolific tech tipster Evan Blass noted that even though Bolt and HTC 10 seem to have the same look, the former will be a larger smartphone. Bolt will reportedly be equipped with a 5.5-inch display, while the flagship model’s display size is only 5.2 inches. Under the display, the leaked renders also showed that Bolt will get a fingerprint scanner located between the front-facing capacitive buttons. Moreover, the rumored smartphone is going to use a USB Type-C port. [Image by David Ramos/Getty Images] As for other purported details on the phone’s camera, Bolt is expected to feature an 18 MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and 4K video capture support. The selfie shooter might get an 8 MP lens sensor. Moreover, when it comes to Bolt’s under the hood specs, the report revealed that it will be packed with 3 GB of RAM. It will also get a 64GB native storage with an option for expansion via a microSD. But on the top of all these purported specs and features is a remarkable change that HTC may apply to Bolt. Accordingly, the upcoming smartphone is going to be the tech company’s first mobile device to drop the 3.5mm headphone jack. This could be plausible especially now that the tech world is slowly seeing other giant players in the market like Apple removing this once fundamental feature in their latest flagship devices. <noscript><iframe width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oFyRks-Qw5Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></noscript> Meanwhile, below is another interesting note pointed out by Evan Blass. “Interestingly, while Bolt does offer HTC’s BoomSound audio-enhancing tech, it’s only available when listening with headphones; the handset itself contains but a single, bottom-firing speaker.” The smartphone’s release date is still unknown but it is expected to have a global launch. It is reportedly hitting the shelves in the US and select countries in territories like Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. Sprint will allegedly carry the device in the US. In fact, as reported in GSM Arena,HTC Bolt is supposedly set for release on Sprint by the end of this month. If this is true, then, this should mean that Bolt’s official introduction is already on the horizon. Are you looking forward to another mobile offering from HTC? The Inquisitr will continue to keep you in the loop for more release and specs updates about the HTC Bolt.

The company today introduced a new feature that will tag and help find “fact checking in large news stories.” Tagged articles will show up in the new story box on news.google.com, as well as in the Google News and Weather app for iOS and Android in the US and UK. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat There’s a two-pronged approach to detecting fact checking. First Google looks for actual markup in the site’s source code. Then Google looks for pages “that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” You can learn more about the process here. Though Google makes no mention of the ongoing US presidential election, I can’t help but feel this is a subtle nudge towards making voters are keeping track of who’s telling the truth and who’s not (need I even explain?). It’s meant to help clear up hoaxes too, but right now, politics are likely the focus. To be clear, the tags show up in small grey text above the article links – Google itself isn’t passing judgement, nor does it tell you the source article’s conclusion in search results. It’s merely a sign that says “hey, read me to find out the truth.” Still, it’s a nice way to make sure readers are at least forming opinions based on fact rather than fiction.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Oct 15, 2016 at 8:50AM Image source: Getty Images. Nearly 10% of all new light vehicles sold will have full self-driving capabilities by 2035, according to IHS Automotive. Automakers and technology companies are delivering incremental self-driving features right now that will eventually bring us full vehicle autonomy in the coming years.  This means there are lots of companies out there making some level of autonomous vehicle technology, and there's no sign of this trend slowing down. Just last month, the U.S. government released federal guidelines for driverless cars, which is estimated to be a $42 billion market by 2025. Needless to say, investors would be wise to jump on the companies that are shaping this industry now. To help you get started, here are three companies that are making huge strides in driverless car tech: Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA). The obvious choice Alphabet's Google has had clear ambitions in the driverless car space for quite a while, and the company is still one of the dominant leaders in creating autonomous car technology.  Google just crossed another milestone with its driverless car technology by racking up a total of 2 million miles of autonomous driving on roadways. The company took six years to reach 1 million miles, but added an additional 1 million miles just 16 months later, according to The Next Web. Google made another huge move in the space this year when it announced that it will work with Fiat Chrysler to build driverless car prototypes. The partnership will combine Google's technology with 100 vehicles (based on the Pacifica) made by Fiat specifically for Google. All of this marks the first time the tech giant is directly working with an automaker.  Google has a clear advantage in the driverless car space that investors shouldn't overlook, even if it's still a bit unclear how the company will make money from its autonomous car technology. It could license the tech to automakers or use its massive amount of data and services to somehow serve ads based on car data (that's just speculation at this point, though). What's clear is that Google is committed to driverless cars (it's already spent more than $60 million, at a $30 million per year run rate), and it's showing no signs of backing away. With millions of autonomous miles driven, a new partnership with Fiat, and plenty of R&D spending, investors shouldn't bet against Google's advantage in the space. The growing driverless car play NVIDIA is building up its own arsenal of automotive technologies and using its experience with graphics processing units (GPUs) to give it a leg up in the space.  NVIDIA's GPUs are already used by automakers to power infotainment systems for Honda, BMW, Tesla, and others, but now it's also using some of its processors to power complex artificial intelligence computers that give driverless cars situational awareness.  The company's Drive PX 2 supercomputer is an on-board AI computer that processes images in real time for self-driving cars and is already used by 80 automakers and Tier 1 automotive suppliers. NVIDIA expanded its reach in the space recently when it released its new Xavier system-on-a-chip (SoC) which is a faster, smarter processor for the Drive PX computer. Xavier uses less energy than before and can essentially do the same work as two former Drive PX processors.  NVIDIA only makes about 8% of its total revenue from its automotive business right now, but the segment is growing. The company improved sales in its automotive business by 68% in fiscal Q2 2017, year over year. If all of that weren't enough, the company is pioneering cloud-to-car technology with its DGX-1 supercomputer that could allow driverless cars to get the most relevant driving information updated from the cloud.  Tesla's tangible driverless tech The electric automaker isn't shy about its driverless car plans. CEO Elon Musk has said that Tesla's vehicles will be able to drive themselves across the country by 2018 (he's also admitted that might take a little longer than that), and the company -- of course -- already has its semi-autonomous feature, Autopilot, in its vehicles.  Tesla has been criticized lately for its Autopilot feature (which allows limited semi-autonomous driving on highways), with Consumer Reports saying that some features aren't yet ready for public beta. The criticism came after a Tesla owner was killed in a crash over the summer when Autopilot failed to recognize a truck turning in front of his vehicle. Tesla has defended Autopilot and recently updated the software to better use the on-board radar to view obstacles and traffic and to see two cars ahead of the vehicle. The update also improved auto-steering and added more safety warnings for drivers. Autopilot also requires drivers to remain alert, keep their hands on the wheel, and to take back control when necessary. Tesla's advantage in the space is that its system is far more advanced than others on the road, and it's readily available in the company's Model S and X vehicles. Even Tesla's upcoming $35,000 Model 3 will have Autopilot capabilities (though it'll add more to the cost). Other automakers may be busy creating their own semi-autonomous systems, but Tesla's version continues to be one of the most prolific.  This might take a while Investors shouldn't expect immediate gains from these companies simply on the basis of their driverless car technologies. Alphabet is a huge tech conglomerate, Tesla makes its money by selling cars, and NVIDIA's core business is selling GPUs for gaming. But these companies are making huge bets on self-driving technology now -- and investors looking to benefit later would be wise to act soon.

From a technical standpoint, the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift are the two best virtual reality headsets on the market. But the Sony PlayStation VR, which went on sale last week, is a close third, which should be good enough to make it the most popular device among people who want to take an early dive into virtual reality. Make no mistake, that dive will cost plenty, and it’s an investment that only early technology enthusiasts will want to make. But after testing a PlayStation VR review unit here at The Chronicle, I believe it’s even more clear that virtual reality is the next new electronic medium. And if you already have a PlayStation 4 game console, Sony’s headset is easier to set up, and cheaper overall than the Vive or the Rift. Sony also makes a compelling case by releasing 30 games like “Batman: Arkham VR,” which is so realistic you believe you’ve become the Caped Crusader. And if you’re not into games, there’s “Allumette,” an engaging animated short story from San Francisco’s Penrose Studios that makes you feel as though you’re floating in the clouds. (Remember to have tissues ready.) I base my comparison on games and other content I’ve sampled on all three of these wired VR headsets over the past year. This month, for example, I tried an Oculus game called “The Unspoken,” which turns you into a wizard who can use his hands to create fireballs to fling. Photo: Liz Hafalia, The Chronicle The Playstation VR device attached to its charge and display station. The Playstation VR device attached to its charge and display station. I’ve also viewed content using the cheaper, entry-level Samsung Gear VR and Google Cardboard viewers, which rely on smartphones to display video, so the resolutions are not as crisp as the PlayStation VR. (Google’s DayDream View isn’t out until next month.) The PlayStation VR will help Sony seize the middle ground because it provides a far better experience than the smartphone viewers and is not as expensive to set up as the Vive or the Rift, which could require spending more to upgrade your PC. The base PlayStation VR costs $400, compared with the the $600 Rift and the $800 Vive. The big difference is that the PlayStation VR requires only a PlayStation 4 video game console instead of a powerful or upgraded PC. If you’re one of the 40 million people who already owns the console, all you have to do is plug in the headset’s included adapter. However, for the full experience, you also need a PlayStation Camera to help track your movements, and a pair of Move hand controllers, which in games like “Batman” give you virtual hands to pick up objects and throw bat-shaped boomerangs as if you were really in the game. Sony is offering an introductory bundle that includes those accessories with the headset for $500. You also have to clear enough space in your room to move around without bumping into furniture. Unlike the Vive, which lets you physically move about in a confined space, the PlayStation VR is mainly meant for users to sit down or stand up in one place. However, I was able to take a step or two around, and for experiences like “Allumette,” I could lean my head forward for a close-up look at the characters. We found setting up the PSVR, which Sony loaned to The Chronicle, takes two people, and so does this review. The Chronicle’s Christopher T. Fong helped me calibrate the headset to the camera so I didn’t have to stumble around with the headset over my eyes. He said he was also surprised by the number of cables required. “I can imaging tripping over cable tentacles around my entertainment center, which also has my X1, X360, PS3, PS4, Roku, sound bar system, vinyl record player and Bluetooth music receiver,” he said. “I’m having ‘Rock Band’ peripherals trauma all over again.” Also, if you’ve never tried VR before and receive the Sony gear as a gift, the whole experience could be confusing. You’ll have to practice putting the strap around your head and adjusting the goggles around your eyes. Make sure you keep the controllers within arms reach. Sony has come a long way since it released the headset as Project Morpheus more than two years ago. Fong was surprised at how comfortable the goggles now feel, even for someone wearing glasses. More by Benny Evangelista Virtual reality beckons holiday shoppers Oculus, Zuckerberg announce $250 million VR investment Warriors showcase VR with Andre Iguodala bobblehead “As an eyeglasses-only kind of person, I noticed the VR screens and text were slightly out of focus,” he said. “However, it wasn’t as noticeable once the games started. The blurred action movements and immersion of being in the game drew my attention away from being picky about a minor focusing problem.” In “Batman,” there is a point when you look in a mirror and see yourself wearing the bat suit. In “Eve: Valkyrie,” you’re sitting in the cockpit of a star fighter heading into a battle in space. For “DriverClub VR,” Fong said, “sitting in an F1 cockpit felt claustrophobic and tight. I was experiencing this virtual anxiety of making fast tight turns. I love that I used the side mirrors trying to spot where other cars were. The PSVR should add a wind machine peripheral.” We did notice the games and content took time to load. This is OK with a regular game because you can do something else, but in a headset, you spend an awful lot of time sitting in the dark waiting for something to happen. Perhaps game makers need to work on more engaging load screens. The Rift and Vive may eventually become less costly, and developers are using their superior technical prowess to come up with some amazing content. But if you want to get into VR now, and don’t want to totally break the bank, the PlayStation VR is worth considering. Benny Evangelista is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     As the world watches Samsung deal with the fallout from what could be the worst smartphone launch in recent memory, there should be a smile on faces at Google headquarters. Samsung is a crucial Google partner for its Android mobile operating system. Indeed, Android and Samsung have become almost synonymous for many consumers these days -- something that Google may not particularly want for its open mobile operating system. So perhaps to shift that perception, Google is trying to stake its own claim to being the premier Android brand with its recent introduction of its Pixel and Pixel XL. Google is moving on the high-end smartphone world at a good time. Samsung, the world's top-selling smartphone maker, is dealing with a potentially brand-crushing crisis. First its new, top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 7 phones caught on fire; now the replacement ones are reportedly exploding, too. The Yonhap News Agency in South Korea reported eight cases of fires in replacement phones, five in the United States, one in South Korea and another in Taiwan. The fallout has been clear: Slightly more than a third of Samsung smartphone owners said they would not buy another phone from the company after the Galaxy Note 7 recall, according to a survey from brand consultant firm Branding Brand, which conducted the poll before the replacements started catching on fire. Meanwhile, Google's other rival in the mobile world -- Apple -- has been dogged by complaints that it is lagging in innovation. Many analysts who expressed that concern were not soothed by the latest iPhone, which took some small steps forward but also controversially ditched the headphone jack. Google went out of its way to mock the iPhone when it introduced the $769 Pixel, noting that its brand-new smartphone is cutting edge but retains its headphone jack. Google even bragged about its new shade of blue for its smartphone, which could be read as a parody of Apple's genuine excitement over its new shade of black. But Samsung's slide, and the damage from its horrendous Galaxy Note 7 launch is perhaps an even greater gift to Google. Many people have turned to Samsung phones as the anti-iPhone preference of choice. With customers admitting they're getting wary about other models of Samsung phones -- despite the fact that none have had problems anywhere near the scale as the Note 7 -- Google's Pixel fits neatly into whatever gap Samsung leaves behind. Compounding those woes even more is the Galaxy battery fires are happening right before the holidays when smartphone companies do their best business. "I think Samsung in their rush to get out the next product obviously didn't study it well enough and now they are suffering the consequences of that lack of care," said Jeff Kagan, an Atlanta-area telecommunications analyst, in an email. "This is devastating to Samsung and will continue to be devastating to Samsung." While Samsung initially reported that the vast majority of Note 7 customers who traded in their phones were choosing another Samsung phone, anecdotal reports online indicate that is no longer the case. In fact, AT&T and T-Mobile said they were going to stop exchanging the Note 7 phones even before Samsung confirmed that it was halting all production of the phone. Even Samsung said it can't fault them for that decision, in light of the scattered reports that the replacement phones are suffering from the same heat problems as the faulty phones they replaced. "We recognize that carrier partners have stopped sales and exchanges of the Galaxy Note 7 in response to reports of heat damage issues, and we respect their decision," Samsung said in a statement. There's no guarantee Google will be able to swoop in and fill the gap completely. The Pixel phones are only available through Verizon, unless shoppers want to pay the full price for an unlocked version on Google's own store. Verizon is the nation's largest carrier, but the exclusive arrangement may limit sales. Still, even if Google's own phone doesn't manage to be the iPhone alternative of the holiday season, the company will still likely see other Android manufacturers get a boost through the end of the year. "While this is terrible news for Samsung, it may be great news for their competitors," Kagan said. "LG, Moto, Huawei and many other Android smartphones will quickly fill the gap left by this Samsung problem." --- The Washington Post's Fred Barbash, and Anna Fifield from Tokyo contributed to this report.

It's already hit a snag: Samsung's deal to acquire Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg)   Mark Bergen Bloomberg     Google just debuted a digital assistant, which it hopes to place inside smartphones, watches, cars and every other imaginable internet-connected device. It's already hit a snag. The Alphabet Inc. division launched new smartphones last week with the artificially intelligent assistant deeply embedded. It also rolled out a speaker with the feature at its core and announced plans to let other companies tie their apps and services to the assistant. A day later, Samsung Electronics Co., one of the largest manufacturers of smartphones and other consumer devices, said it was acquiring Viv Labs, a startup building its own AI voice-based assistant. At first, the deal looked like a counterpunch to Samsung rival Apple -- Viv is run by the creators of Apple's Siri assistant. But buying Viv may be more of a problem for Google, because Samsung is the biggest maker of phones running Google's Android mobile operating system. Google strategy is now centered on the assistant, rather than its search engine, because it's a more natural way for people to interact with smartphones and other connected devices. Getting all Android phone makers to put the Google assistant on their devices would get the technology into millions of hands quickly. But Samsung's Viv deal suggests assistants are too important for phone makers to let other companies supply this feature. Last week, Samsung executive Injong Rhee said the company plans to put Viv's technology in its smartphones next year and then embed it into other electronics and home appliances. A Samsung representative and a Google spokeswoman declined to comment. That's a necessity for Samsung, according to some analysts and industry insiders. "As AI is becoming more sophisticated and valuable to the consumer, there's no question it will be important for hardware companies," said Kirt McMaster, executive chairman of Cyanogen, a startup that makes Android software. McMaster, a frequent Google critic, said other Android handset makers will likely follow Samsung's move. "If you don't have an AI asset, you're not going to have a brain," he added. Google may already have known that some Android phone makers -- known as original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs -- were reluctant to embrace its assistant. "Other OEMs may want to differentiate" Google's Android chief Hiroshi Lockheimer told Bloomberg before it released its own smartphones. "They may want to do their own thing -- their own assistant, for example." Samsung and Google have sparred in the past over distribution. Google requires Android handset makers to pre-install 11 apps, yet Samsung often puts its own services on its phones. And the South Korean company has released devices that run on its own operating system, called Tizen, not Android. Viv was frequently on the short-list of startups that could help larger tech companies build assistant technology. Founded four-years ago by Dag Kittlaus, Adam Cheyer and Chris Brigham, the startup was working on voice technology to handle more complex queries than existing offerings. While it drummed up considerable attention and investment, Viv has not yet released its product to the public. And some analysts are skeptical of Samsung's ability to convert the technology into a credible service, given its mixed record with software applications. "It will be very hard to compete with Google's strength in data and their AI acquisitions," said Jitendra Waral, senior analyst with Bloomberg Intelligence. "Samsung would need to prove that its AI solutions are superior to that of Google's. They are handicapped in this race." Samsung is also focused on handling the fallout from its exploding Galaxy Note 7 phones, potentially taking management time away from its Viv integration. But it's a race Samsung has to join. In recent years, Samsung acquired mobile-payments and connected-device startups to keep up with Apple, Google and Amazon.com Inc. Digital voice-based assistants may be more important, if they become the main way people interact with devices. Silicon Valley titans are rushing into the space because of this potential. Amazon is trying to sign up developers for its Alexa voice technology. Apple has recently touted more Siri capabilities and opened the technology to other developers. And now Google, considered the leader in artificial intelligence, is making its own push. "I don't ever remember a time when every single major consumer tech company -- and even enterprise companies -- have been singularly focused on an identical strategy," said Tim Tuttle, chief executive officer of MindMeld Inc., a startup working on voice interaction software. "They're all following the exact same playbook." --- Jungah Lee contributed.

Live feed Show 10.20am EDT 10:20 So there you have it. Andy Murray is through to yet another final – that’s 10 and counting in 2016 – and will feel he has every chance of clinching his sixth title of the year against an opponent he has beaten in each of their previous two meetings. He wasn’t always at his best against Gilles Simon, but he got the job done at the key moments and rediscovered his service rhythm with a vengeance in the second set. The No1 ranking will have to wait until next year, given that he lags Djokovic by nearly 4,000 points. But the points differential in terms of the race to London – where Murray trails Djokovic by 9,285 points to the Serb’s 10,600 – is indicative of the strides he has made since the turn of the year. Thanks for reading and enjoy your afternoon.

He beat Tsonga the round before [beating Djokovic] and is obviously playing very well. He’s improving all the time and will be highly motivated playing his first Masters Series final. It should be a good match.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.06am EDT 10:06 Speaking to Sky Sports, Murray has this to say of the suggestion that he has Novak Djokovic’s No1 ranking in his sights: “He’s still a long way ahead of me. His loss today helps a little bit, but I’m still a long way behind. I’m not thinking about that right now.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.56am EDT 09:56 Game, set and match Murray, 6-4, 6-3! Second set: Murray* 6-4, 6-3 Simon (*denotes server) It’s taken an hour and 43 minutes of sometimes patchy tennis, but Andy Murray has won in straight sets again. His 22 winners were largely cancelled out by an uncharacteristic 30 unforced errors, but he found an extra gear in the second set, not least on serve. He will now play his 10th final of what has been a remarkable year. Updated at 10.01am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.55am EDT 09:55 Second set: Murray 6-4, 5-3 Simon* (*denotes server) Either Simon has forgotten the scoreline or this is a classic case of a player relaxing and playing his best tennis once victory seems beyond reach. My money’s on the latter. A great game from the Frenchman, full of confidence and authority, belies his match-long struggle with ball in hand and gives Murray plenty to think about as he prepares to serve for the match for a second time. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.49am EDT 09:49 Second set: Murray* 6-4, 5-2 Simon (*denotes server) A loss of focus from Murray or a final gesture of defiance from Simon? However you read it, it’s a break of serve. Some gritty play from Simon carries him to 15-30 on the Murray serve, at which point Murray drives long for no apparent reason. He saves the first by clinching a gruelling, 23-stroke rally, but is unable to stave off the second. Great tenacity from Simon, but probably a case of delaying the inevitable. Probably. Updated at 10.33am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.43am EDT 09:43 Second set: Murray 6-4, 5-1 Simon* (*denotes server) Some mesmerising baseline play from Murray yields another break. It’s not that Simon has played badly here, it’s just that Murray has got progressively better as the match has worn on and the Frenchman has been unable to keep pace with him. Murray to serve for the match and deservedly so. Updated at 9.45am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.40am EDT 09:40 Second set: Murray* 6-4, 4-1 Simon (*denotes server) Another peerless service game from Murray, who has certainly rediscovered his serving mojo in this set. Christine Herbert will be pleased indeed. “Looking at the points difference between Murray and Djokovic at beginning of the season,” she writes, “I would never have thought Murray could have been this close by the end of it. Shame there’s not quite enough points on offer to make it this year – but all to play for next.” Indeed there is, Christine, especially with Djokovic looking so vulnerable just now. Andy appears to be targeting the French Open next year, but the Aussie Open – where he has lost five finals – would seem to offer an equally promising opportunity. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.35am EDT 09:35 Second set: Murray 6-4, 3-1 Simon* (*denotes server) Finally, having been broken five times in succession, Simon holds. Not that you’d know it. There’s no celebration from the Frenchman as Murray fails to make a forehand over the high part of the net, and that suggests he considers himself still very much in this match. He may be alone in that belief. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.30am EDT 09:30 Second set: Murray* 6-4, 3-0 Simon (*denotes server) He’s battling all the way, is Simon, and Murray is struggling to find fluency off the ground. Nevertheless, although breathing heavily at times – and rolling his eyes in dismay when Simon carves out a break point at 30-40 – Murray finds a way. His serve has picked up markedly in this set – he’s missed just one first delivery so far – and he emphasises the improvement with a booming ace to hold. Break consolidated. Special delivery … Andy Murray serves against Gilles Simon of France in their men’s singles semi-final at the Shanghai Masters.

The difference now is that the exchanges are being punctuated by mistakes. Twice Simon makes lamentable errors to fall behind, flirting with a potentially fatal break of serve. But Murray, seemingly rattled by a poor call that required a successful challenge, struggles to summon his trademark consistency, handing Simon a lifeline. Deuce turns to advantage, advantage to deuce. More break points go begging. Neither man can land the decisive blow. Finally, though, Murray constructs a fifth break point, Simon failing to whisk a forehand pass off his shoelaces, and this time the Scot makes the most of it. Another brutal, probing rally concludes with a whirring forehand placement, and Simon has it all to do now. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.13am EDT 09:13 Second set: Murray* 6-4, 1-0 Simon (*denotes server) It’s a measure of Murray’s mettle that he took that opening set despite making 18 unforced errors and winning just 40% of the points played on his second serve. Not that he seems to be dwelling on it much, judging by the alacrity with he wraps up the opening service game of set two. The next game could be crucial for Simon. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.09am EDT 09:09 Murray wins the opening set 6-4! First set: Murray 6-4 Simon* (*denotes server) Wonderful, wonderful tennis – and that’s just the opening point, which culminates with a lovely exchange of touch shots between the two men. Murray comes out on the wrong side of that one, watching helplessly as Simon caresses an angled winner across the face of the net, but hits back from 40-15 down with a combination of gritty defensive play and carefully judged aggression. It carries the world No2 to a set point that he converts in quite delightful fashion, responding to a lob volley from Simon (and when was the last time you saw one of those?) with an exquisite lobbed winner of his own. What a beautiful game tennis can be. Although don’t mention that to Simon, who looks decidedly rueful as he makes his way to the chair. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.00am EDT 09:00 First set: Murray* 5-4 Simon (*denotes server) What is it about this match? Murray has been serving brilliantly all week, but his first delivery seems to have deserted him today. After an error-strewn start to the game, the Scot rolls a topspin forehand into the net for 15-40 and, although he staves off the first break point with some good attacking play, he concedes the next with another unforced error. Dear me. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.56am EDT 08:56 First set: Murray 5-3 Simon*(*denotes server) As Simon moves 30-0 ahead courtesy of a netted backhand volley from the stretching Murray, Simon McMahon writes: “You’re right that us Simons are unassuming, but so is Andy to be fair. And he’s acquired a ruthlessness on court that both Gilles and I can only dream of. I’ll settle for unassuming, though. Which is why I’ll never be world No1.” Neither will Gilles at this rate, Simon. First he misses a forehand, then he double-faults. Sensing vulnerability at the other end of the court, Murray pounces, another foray into the net reaping dividends. Even so, he’s not having the best of days in the forecourt, Murray, and a volleying error sees the break point go begging. No matter. More aggressive play brings up a second chance, and this time the Scot nails it with a superb return. You could stick Marmite on that second serve from Simon and call it toast. Assuming you can find any Marmite, obviously. Ruthless did you say, Simon? You’re not wrong. Updated at 8.56am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.48am EDT 08:48 First set: Murray* 4-3 Simon (*denotes server) The pendulum swings again as Murray struggles to find fluency on his serve. The point is underlined at 0-30 when the Scot produces a wretched double-fault that leaves him gesturing in frustration. If he was upset about that, he’ll be a good deal unhappier about the inelegant forehand volley that he then puts wide to concede the game. The quality has dropped off somewhat, but the contest remains compelling. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.44am EDT 08:44 First set: Murray 4-2 Simon* (*denotes server) Outrallied at 30-30, Simon betrays a first sign of frustration, swatting at a stray ball. An uncharacteristic error from Murray, who drives a straightforward ball long, gets the Frenchman off the hook, but the reprieve proves temporary. A double-fault at deuce lands him in the soup again, and Murray then conjures a penetrating return to get Simon on the run. A deep approach seals the deal and that’s four games in a row for Murray. Stretched … Gilles Simon of France lunges for a return against Andy Murray in their Shanghai Masters semi-final. Photograph: Wang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 10.28am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.38am EDT 08:38 First set: Murray* 3-2 Simon (*denotes server) Simon looks to be wrestling with a tactical quandary. Should he hit to Murray’s forehand, which has been as solid as the proverbial rock this week? Or should he steer the ball to the Murray backhand, which the world No2 is loading with slice, giving his opponent low, skidding balls on which he can get scant purchase? The Frenchman is confounded further when Murray unexpectedly leans a little harder on a two-hander, rushing the scrambling Simon into a backhand error, before finding some extra heat on a second serve to bring up 40-15. Murray seals the game with an imperious backhand winner that his opponent can only stand and admire. Lovely play from the second seed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.31am EDT 08:31 First set: Murray 2-2 Simon* (*denotes server) Four games in and already this is a thoroughly absorbing match, the rallies full of subtle changes of pace and direction. A cerebral exchange at 15-15 culminates with Murray working his way artfully into the forecourt, where he angles away a lovely forehand volley. Another lengthy baseline duel goes in Murray’s favour when a Simon forehand drifts wide, and the break is sealed when the Frenchman nets off the same wing. Great response from Murray.

He seals the game by slamming a forehand winner off a short return, and that should make him feel a lot better. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.22am EDT 08:22 First set: Murray 0-2 Simon* (*denotes server) The quality of the rallies remains high as the players trade blows from the back of the court. But it’s Simon who has settled the quicker – there’s a hint of tension about Murray – and he sees out his opening service game to consolidate the advantage. Plenty for Murray to ponder here already. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.21am EDT 08:21 First set: Murray* 0-1 Simon (*denotes server) Andy Murray hasn’t lost his serve all week. Until now. Simon, never the quickest player out of the blocks, finds a telling forehand pass at 30-30, and rams home the advantage with some typically probing play from the baseline. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.15am EDT 08:15 Still, Novak Djokovic. What an idiosyncratic figure he’s looked this week, humming between points, ripping his shirt, racking up errors. Here’s a report of his defeat. Novak Djokovic loses cool and Shanghai semi-final against Roberto Bautista Agut Read more Updated at 10.25am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10am EDT 08:10 Amid the usual pre-match razzmatazz, the players have made their way out on to court. Murray looks confident and relaxed. Simon looks unassuming. Of course he does. No one does unassuming quite like Simon. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.46am EDT 07:46 Well, well, well. As he tries to make inroads on Novak Djokovic’s points advantage at the top of the world rankings, Andy Murray could have been forgiven for having half an eye on a potential final with the Serb. But the world No1 has crashed out in the semis, losing to Spain’s Roberto Bautista Agut in straight sets. That ought to put a spring in Murray’s step as he prepares to face Gilles Simon, the wily Frenchman over whom he holds a 14-2 head-to-head advantage. Not that Murray needs much by way of encouragement just now. Maintaining the momentum of last week’s China Open victory, Murray has been in dominant form in Shanghai, accounting for Steve Johnson, Lucas Pouille and David Goffin without the loss of a set. If Simon is to notch up his first win over Murray since besting him on an indoor hard court in Rotterdam in February 2015, he’ll need to find something special.

Here's help. Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 15 October, 2016 22:01 - - - - print email Comments We all know about lemmings, right? These tiny Arctic rodents occasionally commit mass suicide by hurling themselves off cliffs en masse. Why, adorable fuzzy creatures? Why? The answer is: They don't. Lemming suicide is a myth, a misconception, a lie. We hold this false belief because a 1958 Disney documentary called White Wilderness staged fake lemming suicide scenes for the camera. (Disney filmmakers shipped lemmings to Canada and chased them off a cliff.) Here's the scene that created the lemming suicide myth. It's hard to know what's true and what's false, and always has been. Hoaxes, rumors, urban legends, conspiracy theories, political spin and propaganda have been with us for millennia. The internet has made this problem both better and worse. It's better because we can look things up and research what's true. For example, Googling "lemming suicide" returns stories on the fabrication of the myth. But it's also worse, because falsehoods are easier to spread on social media and elsewhere. In recent months, fact-checking (which in the past only professional journalists fretted over) has become central to political discourse. "Fact-checking" has come up in discussions about the role of moderators in presidential political debates and has been repeatedly mentioned during the debates themselves. Before the internet, most fact-checking happened before publication. Anyone who cared about facts subscribed to trusted newspapers and magazines. Editors on staff, and sometimes dedicated, full-time fact-checkers, identified and researched every factual assertion. That's all you had to do: Pick reputable sources of news (like the publication you're reading now). Trouble is, social media causes us to lose control over the sources of information we're exposed to. We see whatever is shared by the people we follow. And they share stories from their followers. And so on. Technology created this problem. Can technology solve it? Algorithms giveth, and algorithms taketh away Google this week added a "Fact Check" item to search results. This links to an article that's designed to offer explicit fact-checking related to the search query, and it appears in the expanded story box on Google News for users in the U.S. and U.K., as well as the Google News & Weather apps on both iOS and Android. The "Fact Check" result joins other categorical highlights, including "In-Depth," "Wikipedia," "Local Source" and, my favorite, "Opinion." And speaking of opinion, how does Google choose which fact-check article to highlight? The company starts by looking for schema.org ClaimReview markup, which provides specifics in a web page's code on what exactly is being fact-checked in an article. It then uses a wide range of other signals to surface what Google algorithms conclude is the most reliable and authoritative fact-checking article related to the search query. Nice! Meanwhile, the opposite is happening at Facebook. After Facebook's human editorial team was criticized by a political activist for bias in how they chose stories for Facebook's Trending feature, Facebook laid off the editorial staffers in late August and replaced them with algorithms. Unfortunately, these algorithms are having a hard time telling fake stories from real ones. "The Intersect" reportedly ran a series of experiments and found out that Facebook has published several hoax or fake stories in its Trending section. Facebook algorithms are actually choosing hoaxes and deliberately spreading them to millions of users. Sadly, we humans don't need help from algorithms. We can spread misinformation just fine without them. Anything for traffic Did you hear about Rachel Brewson? She became the subject of a series of articles on the women's site xoJane. She's a Hillary Clinton supporter who fell in love with a Donald Trump supporter named Todd. At first, their political disagreements added passion to their relationship, and they got married. But then things soured, they split up and Rachel penned a post on xoJane headlined, "Trump is Tearing My Marriage Apart." Great story, right? The online news site "Fusion" thought so, and interviewed the couple on camera. So did ABC's Nightline. Unfortunately, it never happened, and Rachel Brewson doesn't exist. The whole thing was a publicity stunt to drive traffic to a now-defunct site called "Review Weekly." They even hired actors to play Rachel and Todd on camera. This is a fraudulent business model. It's fiction presented as nonfiction, based on the idea that a prurient, gossip-centric, reality-TV-obsessed public needs to believe a drama is true in order to stay engaged. Before Jezebel's investigative journalism exposed the fraud, there was no way to "fact-check" the story, no way to know for sure whether the story was true, partly true or a total lie. And speaking of lies... Let's talk politics Political organizations have always spread disinformation that helps their candidates. But in recent years, they've been spreading disinformation about fact-checking itself! I learned this the hard way. Watching the political arguments over the upcoming U.S. presidential election take over my Twitter stream, it became clear that each side was arguing from its own set of facts. And this frustrated me, because facts are facts -- or they're supposed to be. So I experimented by responding to heated political arguments with links to fact-checking sites. To quote a common clickbait catchphrase, you won't believe what happened next! My tweets were pounced upon by hoards of people convinced that fact-checking sites are biased, corrupt and untrustworthy. Every specific site I linked to was discredited as owned or controlled by a politician or their supporters, or it was a "joke," not to be taken seriously. Political propaganda has successfully inoculated a minority of the voting public against the scourge of fact-checking. They've been told that the news media are corrupt and fact-checking sites mere smokescreens. The professional political operatives that advise candidates also anticipate fact-checking and have learned to make their comments fact-check-proof. They do this by being slippery, vague and categorical, instead of specific. An entire political style of speaking has emerged, designed to be fact-check-proof. For example, saying that a candidate voted in Congress against a specific bill designed to thwart ISIS is fact-checkable. Saying that a candidate "did nothing to stop ISIS" is not fact-checkable. Saying that a candidate's specific policy prescriptions have been denounced by a specific expert is fact-checkable. Saying that a candidate "has no clue about what to do [about education and innovation]" is not fact-checkable. Still, the fact-checking sites try to fact-check such statements and wind up posting long-winded explanations and somewhat subjective conclusions, all of which provide more fodder for argument, disagreement and partisanship, rather than clarity over the facts. So is that it? Are we really living in a post-fact world? How to be an informed citizen Thanks to the social web and the way it exposes us all to unreliable content, we're mostly on our own when it comes to figuring out what's true and what's false. In my opinion, each of the major fact-checking sites is pretty solid. And when several sites agree -- when there's a consensus among the fact-checking sites about a specific point -- that consensus can be taken as a fact you can rely on. My favorite fact-checking sites include Emergent, On The Issues, Factcheck.org, Snopes, Politifact, About.com, Truth Or Fiction and Hoax Slayer. My best advice is to promote these sites from passive reference sites to active sources of content. Spend quality time proactively browsing your favorite fact-checking sites, as if they were blogs or news sites. They're great sources of information because they tend to be clear and present controversial information in a systematic way that helps understanding. Also: Add the Twitter accounts of several fact-checking sites to your feed or add the RSS to your reader. Get the facts even before you get the lies. Don't be like the fake Disney lemmings and follow the internet masses over the cliff of confusion. We are not living in a post-fact world. Facts really do exist. And that's a fact.

Australia 12-6 New Zealand (Holmes 43) Live feed Show 7.14am EDT 07:14 Final thoughts: Australia will head to the Four Nations with confidence after this fairly comfortable win over a NZ side that had more sting in defence that offence. Time and again they failed to complete their sets, and often they handed the ball over the Australia on the last after running a play that no-one seemed to know a thing about, much less the person with the ball. Their kicking was awful. Outside of a 20m period into halftime —a period that followed their only try to Proctor— NZ were clearly second best. But they’ve had a fair layoff since the end of the NRL season and I wouldn’t be writing off their Four Nations chances just yet. Australia weren’t exactly polished but they showed far greater composure and their left side attack looked particularly potent. All three debutants (Boyd, Holmes and Frizell) did well but it was old-hand Inglis who caused the most trouble, and he ended up as man of the match. As usual captain Smith and half Cronk kept the side well-oiled. And that’s that. Thanks for coming. See you next time.

A 25 per cent drop in the company’s market value this year has ratcheted up pressure for a sale. Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, has little choice but to rally his troops in hopes of hastening improvements that would broaden the microblogging and video platform’s appeal — and keep predatory buyers at bay.  (BRYAN THOMAS / NYT FILE PHOTO)   By Michael LewisBusiness Reporter Sat., Oct. 15, 2016 Left at the altar after seeking buyout offers from potential suitors including Google and Salesforce.com, Twitter Inc. remains an independent company by default. As such, CEO Jack Dorsey has little choice but to rally his troops in hopes of hastening improvements that would broaden the microblogging and video platform’s appeal — and keep predatory buyers at bay. “The people who use Twitter every day deserve our best,” Dorsey said in a memo to staff obtained by Bloomberg on Monday. He cited Twitter’s live video strategy, calling the company the “people’s news network. The fastest place to get information — now it needs to be the first place people check to see what’s happening.” The 410-word memo did not mention the possibility of a sale, Twitter’s stagnating user growth, tumbling share price, or the fact that much larger rival Facebook is social media’s de facto first choice for news and information. Article Continued Below Along with growth worries and Twitter’s struggle to wring profits from its 313 million active monthly users, a 25 per cent drop in the company’s market value this year has ratcheted up pressure for a sale. Some have even called for an activist investor like Carl Icahn to take control of Twitter to pare costs, retool strategy and replace senior management. The loss of advertisers to Google and Facebook, along with disappointing engagement in the U.S., reportedly led Twitter to seek expressions of interest from potential acquirers with the process to be concluded by Oct. 27 when Twitter is slated to report third quarter earnings. But website Recode last week said rumoured buyers Disney, Google and Apple were all unlikely to enter the race to acquire money-losing Twitter, while cloud computing company Salesforce has taken itself out of the bidding, although it along with Google are still seen as among the most likely buyers. The indications of cold-footed suitors pushed shares down 10 per cent this week, helping to reduce Twitter’s market cap from more than $17 billion (U.S.) to $12.64 billion. That makes Twitter more affordable, but its market valuation remains high and future profitability is very much in doubt, according to Hedge fund manager John Hempton, who in a blog post, said the answer is big cuts in spending and staff to make the company more palatable to strategic buyers. Some analysts, however, believe the stock has farther to fall before any offer emerges from a strategic buyer or a private equity player who could shake out costs and replace Dorsey as CEO. A possibility is that Twitter will remain independent at least in the near term, allowing Dorsey more time to hone a strategy that relies on live streaming of sports, embraces longer tweets and encourages image and video sharing interactivity. Observers said premium subscription pricing could be applied to specialized content as a way to monetize segments of its users on an Internet network where too few brands have been willing to commit. “It a wonderful platform . . . that would be a tasty bit for Google to snap up,” said Barry Schwartz, chief investment officer at Baskin Wealth Management in Toronto. But he said investors are clearly disappointed with the progress Twitter has made under co-founder Dorsey on the road to monetization and profitability. Dorsey replaced Dick Costolo as CEO in the summer of 2015, although Dorsey has held onto his other job as chief executive of e-commerce company Square. Dorsey introduced several changes in an attempt to spur user growth and engage advertisers on Twitter, including a feature that highlights the best of the San Francisco-based company’s platform at any given moment. The company has also entered into a series of new sports-streaming deals and on Thursday announced that its live-video service Periscope will now let media companies and other users channel live video feeds directly, without the need for a smartphone to record the images. But industry data suggest the changes have so far failed to increase daily time spent on the platform and Twitter in its most recent earnings report showed just 1 per cent sequential user growth. It posted revenue below analysts’ estimates, with sales expanding year over year at the slowest pace since its IPO. Twitter also reported a smaller $86.4 million loss and positive free cash flow. And despite intense volatility around Twitter shares amid buyout speculation, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Sandler in a report said market checks point to a third quarter revenue in the high end of forecasts, along with a slight improvement in monthly active users. “We think 4Q guidance could meet/exceed consensus.” David Trainer of research firm New Constructs, meanwhile, argues that Twitter’s live video streaming strategy holds promise, saying companies including Time Warner and Ford have signed deals with Twitter that guarantee ads on selected videos in Twitter accounts. “Despite its growth problems, Twitter is a unique platform, not only for live videos, but also for getting fast news from a wide variety of sources,” he said. “If the company can make it more convenient for people to use the service, and it keeps on working to improve user engagement, Twitter has a lot of room to grow.” Read more about: Twitter, Google The Morning Headlines NewsletterDelivered daily to your inbox.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.51am EDT 08:51 Neben’s bid for glory looks set to fall short, with the gap just 20 seconds with 20km to go. Germany and Poland are making rare appearances at the front of the pack. It’s worth mentioning, given that this is a world championship event, that away from the finish line, absolutely no-one is watching from the side of the road. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.46am EDT 08:46 The peloton has shed a fair few riders in the attritional heat, but the big players are present, and have cut the gap on Neben to 25 seconds. The American looking slightly less carefree at the front, with 22km to go, and events back in the pack aren’t going the USA’s way either – Carmen Small needs a tyre change, and is left waiting at the side of the road. Ella (@ellacyclingtips) The last time a rider was both the world TT and RR champion was in 1995 when Jeannie Longo dominated. Can @amberneben repeat? #UCIDoha2016 October 15, 2016 Updated at 8.49am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.44am EDT 08:44 Two women that have driven the pace at different times today – Netherlands’ Ellen van Dijk and Australia’s Loren Rowney – lost touch with the main group at the start of this penultimate lap. Van Dijk has fought back, but Rowney’s race looks to be over. The same goes for Zabelinskaya, who has been disqualified and is waved off the course before she can begin another lap. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.39am EDT 08:39 There’s still a lack of organisation at the front of the pack, which allows Neben, a time trial master, to maintain her lead around the western edge of the Pearl. Britain have eight riders, and haven’t put the work in that the Dutch have – what can Deignan, Barnes, King et al pull out of the bag in the latter stages? It’s all very tactical with just over 25km to go. Sarah Connolly (@_pigeons_) One reason a lot of teams aren't chasing Neben yet is that if she's caught too soon, opens up chances for more Dutch attacks #UCIDoha2016 October 15, 2016 Updated at 8.41am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.37am EDT 08:37 Two laps to go, and Neben crosses in a time of 2:27:53 – and a gap of 36 seconds, as the peloton begin to regain their momentum. It took me longer than two-and-a-half hours to go 120km yesterday, and I was a) not travelling in desert heat, and b) in a car. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.34am EDT 08:34 Teams with pure sprinters in their midst – Wild’s Dutch team and Chloe Hosking’s Australia – are setting the pace at the top of the peloton, with Neben threatening to stretch her lead to a full minute. The shadows are lengthening in Doha, the temperature dropping a couple of degrees, but still unbelievably hot, of course. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.29am EDT 08:29 Much like in the Rio road race, Deignan is keeping a low profile, occasionally visible near the front as other riders burn themselves out trying to haul Neben in. 35km to go, and the gap is 45 seconds. It’s still a big ask, but she looks remarkably comfortable. Updated at 8.31am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.25am EDT 08:25 Those capable of taking this race in a breakaway move are agitating at the front of the pack – including Vos and Deignan.

Further down the field, Zabelinskaya appears to have been disqualified, for getting a tow from her team to get back into the pack. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.23am EDT 08:23 The Dutch team in an awkward spot now, lacking the legs to reel Neben in, and lacking support from the peloton after their aggressive tactics in the opening laps of this final circuit.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.21am EDT 08:21 After a nervous ride through the free zone which saw a couple of riders, including Russia’s Olga Zabelinskaya, forced off their bikes, we have a solo breakaway, with American Amber Neben taking advantage of a tired peloton to carve out a 20-second lead. The 41-year-old will be feeling confident; she won the time trial here four days ago. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.15am EDT 08:15 Now it’s the turn of Anna van der Breggen, the Olympic champion, to crank up the pace, hands across the front of her handlebars, making it all look much easier than it actually is.

Updated at 8.35am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.10am EDT 08:10 Dani King does make a move to keep pace with Vos, and a gap opens briefly before the peloton, led by Australia, reel them back in.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.09am EDT 08:09 They’re moving through the gears along a shady section of road, with Annemiek van Vleuten setting the pace. After her horrific crash in Rio, it’s remarkable that she’s racing here at all. She makes way for Amy Pieters, and then Vos, as the Netherlands are forced to counter-attack themselves. None of the other nations stocked with riders are willing to get involved. 50km to go... Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.04am EDT 08:04 Hanselmann, previously part of a breakaway with Yonamine, is now rolling along at the back of the bunch, as shown by her on-board camera.

Updated at 8.18am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.59am EDT 07:59 Thanks Les. We’ve got 57km of racing to go, and another Dutch drive, led by the legendary Marianne Vos, has hauled in the breakaway. Every Dutch rider apart from sprinter Kirsten Wild has pulled away off the front, and it’s starting to wear the peloton out in 37-degree heat. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 With 65km left, the Dutch push hard again at the front through Vos. Deignan is quick to respond. As the pace quickens, the head of the peloton is starting to thin visibly. And as the tension ratchets up, I’m going to hand over to my colleague Niall McVeigh, who will guide you through the remainder of the race. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.46am EDT 07:46 Attack and retreat remains the order of the day as the big guns look to thin the field. Van der Breggen leads the latest charge by the Dutch, and it certainly has the desired effect, stretching the front of the peloton. Vos is up there too, with Deignan and King likewise firmly in the frame. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.41am EDT 07:41 Spare a thought for Giorgia Bronzini, who was unable to contest the race after falling sick.

It doesn’t last long, but it could be part of a wider attempt to break up the Australian contingent. We’ll see. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.29am EDT 07:29 Aussie, Aussie, Aussie! Which is to say, the Australians are coming. Or they may be, at least. Chloe Hosking is among a group of three or four jostling for position at the head of the peloton, and that’s one to keep an eye on. If any country can live with the Dutch contingent in a bunch sprint, it’ll be them. They’re joined by a glut of German riders. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.25am EDT 07:25 Back at the front, where Yonamine has been joined by Nicole Hanselmann of Switzerland, there’s a 47-second gap to the field with 82km left. Surely the British will need to start thinking about splitting up the peloton soon? They can ill afford to sprint it out with the Dutch come the business end of proceedings. Speaking of the Netherlands, Vos is now close to the front of the peloton. She’s not been too prominent so far, but it’s unlikely things will stay that way. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.20am EDT 07:20 And as I write that, race favourite Kirsten Wild is unseated following a slow-motion collision with Poland’s Alicja Ratajczak. She’s quickly up, is the Dutchwoman, and doesn’t look unduly perturbed, but her bike may have sustained some damage. She’s just had to stop again for a technical adjustment and it’ll be interesting to see how the Dutch team respond. Will they help her back into contention, or will they simply seek to capitalise on their compatriot’s misfortune? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.16am EDT 07:16 With the race yet to start in earnest, the sprint specialists would doubtless be licking their lips if they weren’t so parched. Anna van der Breggen is at the head of the peloton, and you have to wonder whether the Dutch are trying to control the pace before battling it out late on. The big question being, as ever with Dutch teams, will they work for the collective good or break ranks in pursuit of solo glory? Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.00am EDT 07:00 Meanwhile, further up the field, there’s a 21-second gap between Yonamine and the chasing pack with 97km to go. Updated at 7.10am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.58am EDT 06:58 It’s not been a good race for Kuwait so far. Noura Alameeri suffered an early crash, and she’s now been joined on the sidelines by Nada Aljeraiwi, if I’m not mistaken. That leaves Naija Aljeraiwi as the sole Kuwaiti representative. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.53am EDT 06:53 With 105km to go and the gap to Yonamine at 25 seconds, Russia hit the front of the peloton. There’s a grim determination etched on the collective countenance, with the riders desperately swilling water and dousing themselves with the dregs. Amber Neben, who is still bringing up the rear, is taking on ice. Looks like she’s collecting as much water as she can for her team-mates. No doubt they’ll be grateful. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.47am EDT 06:47 Plenty of action at the first feed zone, with all the riders scrambling to get fluids on board. Who can blame them in these conditions? Meanwhile, Yonamine continues to set the pace. She’s half a minute ahead of the rest. Interestingly, the 25-year-old is a former tennis player who only switched to cycling while at university. Judging by her performance here, she must have been an attack-minded sort on the tennis court; clearly she enjoys carrying the fight to the opposition. The riders head towards the gateway of the Pearl. Photograph: Bryn Lennon/Getty Images Updated at 7.01am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.40am EDT 06:40 Team tactics are likely to have a big bearing on the race and, with that in mind, it’s interesting that Roxane Kneteman has moved to the front of the peloton. The Dutch are the only team other than Great Britain with a full complement of eight riders and, with sprinters of the quality of Wild and Vos in their ranks, they’ll be eager to ensure a fast finish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.33am EDT 06:33 Britain’s Hannah Barnes leads the peloton, which still lags Yonamine by about 20 seconds. It’s exhausting just watching, and we’re still on lap one of seven of this sweltering circuit. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.29am EDT 06:29 With the Pearl looming, a bunch of British riders have made their way to the front of the peloton. Dani King, who missed out on Rio in such heartbreaking fashion, is up there. So too is Lizzie Deignan. The gap to Yonamine is down to 15 seconds, although not for Amber Neben. A problem with her chain stopped the American in her tracks a couple of minutes ago, although she’s making up ground fast at the back of the field. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.23am EDT 06:23 Yonamine ploughs on into a light headwind of about five or six miles per hour. She’s about 38 seconds ahead of the main field at this stage. With the race expected to culminate in a bunch sprint, it’s interesting that she’s decided to seize the initiative so early. Fracturing the peloton is probably the best way to avoid a bunch finish, but it’ll take serious stamina to make the running and then break away from a smaller group in the closing stages. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.13am EDT 06:13 Yonamine continues to set the pace, with the gap to the peloton about 20 seconds. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.11am EDT 06:11 The distinctive Qatari landscape, full of cranes and construction sites, flashes past as the riders make their way towards the Pearl, an artificial island off the West Bay. Japan’s Eri Yonamine has made an early break from the peloton, but there’s no immediate reaction from the chasing pack. Little wonder, with 133 kms remaining. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.03am EDT 06:03 They’re off! It looks swelteringly hot and, as the riders make their way around the wide, open roads of Qatar’s Education City, the peloton looks loose and relaxed. No surprise there. These are not the conditions in which to make a flying start. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 5.47am EDT 05:47 Preamble Good morning and welcome. If you like your sport laced with dramatic subplots, you’ve come to the right place. While the competitors in this year’s women’s road race world championships will have their eyes firmly on the prize, the contest promises a host of potentially spellbinding sideshows and minor-key dramas. British interest will focus on Lizzie Deignan, the reigning champion, who is approaching the 134.5km course around Doha as “the last weekend of a tough year” defined by her successful appeal against a doping ban in the prelude to the Olympics. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the controversy in which she became embroiled after missing three tests under the whereabouts rule has taken a mental toll on Deignan, and the noises emanating from her camp – not to mention the rider herself – suggest the combined effects of fatigue and an unfavourable course may be too much to handle. But it’s not all about Deignan. A flat course with no climbs will inevitably favour the sprinters, which makes Kirsten Wild of the Netherlands the woman to beat. Australia’s Chloe Hosking, who in July sped to a brilliant La Course victory on the Champs Élysées, has been preparing for the sweltering conditions in the Qatar capital by transforming her bathroom into a temporary sauna; she’s no slouch either. Ditto Marianne Vos, another former La Course winner, who has no fewer than seven sprint victories to her name this year. And let’s not forget her Dutch compatriot, Annemiek van Vleuten, who crashed out of the Olympic road race in such horrific fashion but – having recovered from a cracked spine – is fit and raring to go again. What a story it would be if she could win today. All that, and we haven’t even mentioned Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen, or the Belgian speedster Jolien D’Hoore. It should be quite a race.

We weren’t sure when they would land but that may have been cleared up to a degree today thanks to a new leak. There isn’t a lot of time left in 2016 for new smartphones and mobile gadgets to be announced. While there are always a few surprises out of left field, things are definitely winding down for the most part. There has been a lot of discussion on the Android Wear platform lately as well, including the fact manufacturers are opting to try different OS’s like Tizen. Well, it appears we won’t see the two new Google Smartwatches debut this year according to a tweet from @Evleaks. Google’s two smartwatches will be released with Android Wear 2.0 in Q1 2017 [image courtesy of: https://t.co/so8uJyEZCy] pic.twitter.com/ruejqXSNSy — Evan Blass (@evleaks) October 13, 2016 Evan Blass took to Twitter with news on the new Google Smartwatches. As you can see from the Tweet, there’s not much to say aside from the fact it will be disappointing to not have one under the tree this year. Nothing new was added in regards to the specs, but we know it will roll out with Android Wear 2.0 whenever it lands next year. While a solid release date would have been nice, they are likely to change and Q1 of 2017 narrows things down quite a bit. If true, the Google Smartwatches will debut between January 1st and March 31st which will be here quicker than you think. That said, it will be interesting to see what other wearables show up considering Huawei and others held off on new wearables this year. Are you excited for a true Google smartwatch?

Are you starting to get the picture? Google is by far the biggest search engine in the world, being used by billions of people on an every day basis. Actually, the expression “Google it” entered the folklore, just like “Xerox it” was back in the day with regard to photo copiers. If you are wondering what’s the problem with fact-check labels, well, just consider a few basic facts: Google’s search algorithms were proved to be “biased” in the past, times and times again. There were numerous articles written about how Google and Facebook are censoring news stories, favoring “selected” (left wing) candidates, imposing news-trends and things of that nature. Basically, both Google and Facebook can be described as digital ghettos in which information is “spoon-fed” or disseminated to the users, as opposed to a free-flow of information, as in a free market of ideas. Thing is, you don’t have any control over Google’s algos, and they’re a quasi-monopoly, having a global 73% market share, meaning that 3 in 4 people are using Google when searching the Interwebz. With great power comes great responsibility, of which Google has none. Let me elaborate on today’s news: Google will use an algorithm for determining if a news story featured in Google News requires a fact check label. That’s because Google wants us to be happy and well informed, by helping us, chickens, to find fact checking when it comes to large/sensitive news stories. There are over 100 fact checking websites currently, but it was proven times and times again that they can’t be trusted 100%, as they can (and will be) used for spinning public opinion, trends, influence elections, as in big tech companies colluding with Big Brother, times and times again. Who will fact check the fact checkers? I strongly recommend you to stop using Google search and to get out of the digital ghettos ASAP.

Home National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Washington Free Beacon National Security Politics Issues Culture Columns Store Trump Picks Reince Priebus as White House Chief of Staff Painting the American Identity Managing an Ancient Empire Podesta Linked Up Google’s Executive Chairman and Cheryl Mills, Robby Mook Google was accused of manipulating search results for Hillary Share Tweet Email Eric Schmidt / AP BY: Joe Schoffstall Follow @JoeSchoffstall October 14, 2016 1:50 pm Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta facilitated meetings between Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and key Clinton players Robby Mook and Cheryl Mills in 2014, according to hacked emails released by WikiLeaks. Schmidt also quietly funds a data company that provides services to the Clinton campaign. Podesta wrote to Schmidt on April 3, 2014, saying he would like him to speak with Robby Mook, now Clinton’s campaign manager, and Cheryl Mills, a longtime Clinton aide. “Robby is in Australia. Back the 23rd. We could arrange a call before or wait and do a meeting shortly after return,” Podesta said. “Cheryl Mills is in town and I think it would be good for you two to talk. Her office is in Bethesda but probably could come down this afternoon. Up for that?” “thank you !!! i’ll plan to see robby when he is back in dc,” Schmidt responded (sic throughout). “Cheryl would be great to see; I have a meeting with President from 11 to 1145 and free after that all afternoon any time in the afternoon that is convenient for her is good for me.” Schmidt then provided Podesta with his phone number. Earlier this year, Schmidt found himself under fire after Google’s search engine was accused of manipulating searches in favor Hillary Clinton and against Donald Trump. The allegations stemmed from a video released in June by SourceFed, a news website and YouTube channel. The group showcased how Google’s autocomplete features differed from other major search engines and was altering searches to paint Clinton in a more favorable light. SourceFed discovered that when the phrase “Hillary Clinton Cri” was typed into Google’s search engine, it would autocomplete to “Hillary Clinton Crime Reform,” “Hillary Clinton Crisis,” and “Hillary Clinton Crime Bill 1994.” When the same phrase was typed into Bing and Yahoo, Google’s competitors, the autocomplete showed “Hillary Clinton criminal charges,” “Hillary Clinton crimes,” Hillary Clinton criminal.” SourceFed also found that Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders did not receive the same treatment. When the group typed the same phrases into all of the search engines for Sanders and Trump, all three yielded identical results. A search for “Donald Trump rac,” for example, suggested “Donald Trump racist” on Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Schmidt responded to the allegations by claiming he does not support any candidate for president. “We have not taken a position on the American election and nor do I expect us to,” Schmidt said. Despite Schmidt’s publicly neutral stance on the election, he has provided funding to The Groundwork, a data startup that provides services to Clinton’s campaign. Michael Slaby, the former chief integration and innovation officer for Obama’s campaign, is the cofounder of Timshel, the company that developed The Groundwork. The Groundwork’s website does not provide any information on its data services and only displays a logo. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has paid The Groundwork almost $600,000 for “technology services” since the campaign’s inception, filings show. Hillary for America appears to be the only committee that pays The Groundwork this election cycle. Slaby did not respond to a request for comment sent to his company. Schmidt did not respond to inquiries sent to his email address dealing with the leaked Podesta emails and his funding of The Groundwork. Becca Rutkoff, a member of Google’s global communications and public affairs team, sent the Washington Free Beacon a statement the company released in June on the accusations it was manipulating its search results. “The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging,” the statement reads. “We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people. This filter operates according to the same rules no matter who the person is, as you can see in some examples here.” “Autocomplete isn’t an exact science, and the output of the prediction algorithms changes frequently,” it continues. “Predictions are produced based on a number of factors including the popularity and freshness of search terms. Given that search activity varies, the terms that appears in Autocomplete for you may change over time.” Clinton’s campaign did not respond to inquiries.

Big Blue boffin Jennifer Chu holds a Power CPU die (Source: IBM) 15 Oct 2016 at 07:42, Chris Williams Chris Williams Get email alert when this author posts Common Topics Windows 10, Arm, Apple, Intel, Microsoft Recent Articles Today the web was broken by countless hacked devices – your 60-second summary AMD is a rounding error on Intel's spreadsheet and that sucks for us all Intel stock falls on glum Q4 Google has gently increased pressure on Intel – its main source for data-center processors – by saying it is "looking forward" to using chips from IBM and other semiconductor rivals. The web advertising giant said it hopes to use a mix of "architectures within our cloud" in the future. Back in April, Google revealed it had ported its online services to Big Blue's Power processors, and that its toolchain could output code for Intel x86, IBM Power and 64-bit ARM cores at the flip of a command-line switch. As well as Power systems, Google is experimenting with ARM server-class chips and strives to be as platform agnostic as possible. The keyword here is experimenting: the vast majority of Google's production compute workloads right now run on Intel x86 processors. In fact, according to IDC, more than 95 per cent of the world's data center compute workloads run on Intel chips. Thus, to keep its supply options open, to keep Intel from price gouging it, and to evaluate competing hardware, Google test drives servers with non-x86 CPUs. It makes sense to widen your horizons. On Friday this week, Google stepped up from simply toying with gear from Intel's competitors to signaling it seriously hopes to deploy public cloud services powered by IBM Power chips. "We look forward to a future of heterogeneous architectures within our cloud," said John Zipfel, Google Cloud's technical program manager. This comes as Google shared draft blueprints for the Zaius P9 server: an OpenCAPI and Open-Compute-friendly box with an IBM Power9 scale-out microprocessor at its heart. That's the same Power9 the US government is using in its upcoming monster supercomputers. Google has worked with Rackspace, IBM and Ingrasys on the Zaius designs – you may recall that the Zaius concept was unveiled in April. The Zaius block diagram ... click to enlarge (Source: Google) OpenCAPI is the anyone-but-Intel interconnect fabric that emerged this week; the Zaius P9's OpenCAPI compatibility, and support for Nvidia's high-speed NVLink, further highlights Google's reluctance to be shackled to Intel. As well as supporting OpenCAPI, the Z9 has 16 channels of DDR4 memory, SATA and USB interfaces, gigabit Ethernet, BMC and serial access, and a bunch of PCIe gen-4 interfaces. It takes a 48V supply – a voltage level that apparently hits a sweet-spot for data center machines in terms of power and energy efficiency – and meets the Open Rack v2 standard. The blueprints will be submitted to the Open Compute Project (OCP) to evaluate and approve. Hyper-scale companies like Google and Facebook publish their server specifications so Asian hardware manufacturers can mass produce them on the cheap, relatively speaking. That way, cloud giants get to buy exactly what they want without having to negotiate deals with traditional server vendors like Hewlett Packard Enterprise. "We've shared these designs with the OCP community for feedback, and will submit them to the OCP Foundation later this year for review," explained Zipfel. "This is a draft specification of a preliminary, untested design, but we’re hoping that an early release will drive collaboration and discussion within the community." Aside from compute workloads, we understand Google uses customized Nvidia GPUs for its AI-powered Google Translate service, and no doubt in other platforms too alongside its machine-learning ASIC. It also uses a customized network controller with builtin intelligence to manage and access vast pools of cached information with low latency.

The neighbourhood that doesn't exist on Google Maps AOL Money UK 15/10/2016 Rosie Vare © Provided by AOL Money UK The celebrity neighbourhood that doesn't exist on Google Maps It's not unusual for celebrities to want a little privacy when it comes to their personal lives but what about when the media and paparazzi follow your every turn? This is what happens on a daily basis for stars like Kim Kardashian and her husband, Kanye West. After recently being the victim of a terrifying burglary while on holiday in Paris, it's not surprising the pair keep themselves to themselves at home. Hidden Hills is an exclusive neighbourhood in Los Angeles that is so private you won't even be able to find it on Google Maps. If you search for a property in the complex online, you won't be able to find it because as far as Google Maps is concerned, it's invisible. While the area does appear on the maps there are no details of any of the roads that are found in the neighbourhood. All of the 550 homes there cannot be seen on Google Street View. Google's high tech street cars that photograph homes are actually banned from entering the gated community. Usually when you type in an address on a public street Google Street view allows you to see each home from any angle you choose. You won't have much luck when it comes to Hidden Hills however, the function won't even let you move any further down the street. The discreet neighbourhood gives piece of mind to celebrities who spend their lives in the spotlight but want to do a disappearing act at home.

Dropbox users up until now could only use the service's own authentication system to create an account and sign in to it using apps, desktop clients or the web version. This changed recently as it is now possible to authenticate using a Google account. While that means association the account with Dropbox, the solution may be preferred by some users to unify accounts on the Internet. So, instead of having to use two accounts, one for Google and another for Dropbox, users could use Google for both. Dropbox: sign in with Google Users who are new to Dropbox can sign up to Dropbox using their Google account. This simplifies sign up as there is no need to specify a password for the account. You are probably wondering if the change applies to Dropbox users who have set an email from a different provider as their Dropbox account email. They don't directly. These users may change their Dropbox email address however to benefit from the new sign in option as well. Here is how that is done: Load https://www.dropbox.com/account/security#profile in the web browser of choice. You may need to sign in using your existing account depending on your preferences. You find a "change email" option under personal email on the main profile page. Follow the steps outlined there to switch it to your Google email address. You should have a Gmail address listed under personal email after the process. Once that is out of the way, you may use the "sign in with Google" option on Dropbox to sign in to the account. The first time you do that you are asked to add an account. Pick your account on the page that opens, or click on add account if it is not listed on that page. The next page lists the permissions that Dropbox requests. This includes viewing your email address, basic profile information, and managing your contacts. Please note that you cannot disallow this if you want to proceed. There is no option for instance to block Dropbox from accessing your contacts. This process works only if the personal email listed under the Dropbox account is identical to the Google email address. You will get an error message in the last step otherwise. Please note that Dropbox distinguishes between email addresses ending in gmail.com and googlemail.com. You will still be asked to enter the two-factor authentication code of the Dropbox account if you have enabled it for the account. Now You: Do you use Dropbox or do you prefer a different cloud storage provider? Summary Article Name Dropbox: sign in with Google Description Dropbox users who have associated a Google email address with their account may use Google directly now to sign in to their account.

Reply Jason October 16, 2016 at 6:18 pm # Judging from the comments here, I see that I'm not the only person wondering, "Why the hell would I want Google to be connected with my Dropbox account?" You people make me happy. :) For the record, I still have a Dropbox account for sharing stupid things with a couple of friends. But increasingly I am relying on OwnCloud running on my own little server. You should try it - it's way easier than you may think. In fact there are some companies out there selling mini PCs that are pre-configured to run OwnCloud services. Alternately, you can rent some server space from a hosting company. Either way, only *you* will have the encryption keys. You won't have to worry about Dropbox, or Dropbox's business partners.... Reply Uhtred October 17, 2016 at 9:49 pm # if memory serves me rightly, you can have several gmails for one main account, so if you used an alt gmail, would it still access all your contacts or just that "associated gmail contacts?" The dropbox-google thing might be good for some, but I prefer to keep my eggs in separate baskets. I've given up on dropbox software for destop, and manually access its site online via browser... not only does dropbox software repeatedly fire up its updater and so on, but each time it syncs I find on win 7 it trips my file explorer from details view to icon view, which is very annoying.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (12) Post your comment Confirmed: Pixels bought from Google are rootable, come with unlockable bootloaders 14 October 2016 Some of the purported disadvantages inherent when ordering a Google Pixel or Pixel XL from Verizon have been debunked already - the phones will ship with three bloatware apps, all of them uninstallable; software updates will be issued at the same time as for units bought elsewhere. One thing that's clear, however, is that Verizon's Pixels will not have unlockable bootloaders. That's not surprising given the carrier's general policy towards such things. But what about units purchased from Google? Sure, Nexus devices all had unlockable bootloaders, but the Pixels might be different in that regard, given the new branding and all. Thankfully, that's now been confirmed not to be the case. A Google spokesperson issued the following statement: Yes, Pixel owners who purchased the device from the Google store will be able to root their devices. Pixel phones purchased from the Google store will ship with an unlockable bootloader. That should make tinkerers everywhere happy. There is however one caveat, and it has to do with rooting and receiving over-the-air updates after that - or rather, not receiving them. Rooting involves modifying partitions on the phone. If the partitions are modified the OTA will fail to apply. So there you go. Some good news and some bad news. Anyway, all of this is bound to be relevant for just a small number of Pixel buyers, those interested in such things. The average Joe isn't likely to care either way.

To make sure you never miss an issue, subscribe to my weekly email briefing. News Facebook’s Workplace arrives—In tests it was called Facebook at Work, but now that it’s available to any organization that wants to pony up for it, Facebook has named its workplace messaging tool Workplace. Designed to take on popular tools like Slack, Hipchat, Yammer, and Chatter, Workplace brings a Facebook-like interface to the enterprise. The tool features groups, updates, the ability to tag people, share files, chat with multiple colleagues, and publish material. Options also include one-on-one video calls, group audio calls, and Facebook Live-like video broadcasts. The service is $3 per user per month for the first 1,000 users, $2 per user per month for the next group up to 10,000 users, then $1 per user per month for more than 10,000. A 3-month trial is available at no charge. The takeaway: Facebook will have to overcome corporate resistance to employees using Facebook, but built-in familiarity with the interface is a huge benefit. I’m not ready to predict success, but Workplace has all the makings of a blockbuster product—and the pricing is highly competitive. With hooks into other enterprise systems, it could be the future intranet in a lot of organizations. Read more Fake news persists on Facebook’s trending topics—It has been weeks since Facebook promised to address the flood of fake news its algorithms were injecting into its Trending feature after the company axed its human editors after allegations of bias. A Washington Post experiment found that the fake stories are still a problem. Between August 31 and September 22, the Post found five “indisputably fake” trending stories and three “profoundly inaccurate” items. The takeaway: Facebook insists it’s not a media company. They’re wrong. It’s one of the most powerful media companies in the world and this is a problem it must fix. In the meantime, do what I do: Ignore the trending items (or at least view them with a grain of salt) until they get this right. Read more Wells Fargo presents its crisis plan—On a conference call with 500 of its senior executives, Wells Fargo said business would decline more due to its scandal before things start to improve. Among the plans are “listening tours” undertaken by a new community bank executive, regular memos and videos to employees, and increased proactive communication with large investors. The company has also launched “Project Duel,” designed to “clarify roles and responsibilities and to improve oversight and controls and reduce duplication.” The bank will also investigate claims of retaliation from employees who called its ethics hotline. Wells Fargo has also bought more social media advertising than usual and plans more proactive customer outreach. The takeaway: It’s hard to deduce much from a report of a private conference call, but what’s missing here is a dedicated effort to rebuild public trust. The call was led by former CEO John Strumpf just before he resigned. Read more Google introduces fact-checking—A new Google feature tags and helps users find “fact-checking in large news stories.

Google will search for actual markup in the source code of the site reporting the news, then seek pages “that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” The takeaway: The torrent of lies in the current “post-truth” election cycle is most likely the catalyst for this new feature, but its impact could be felt far beyond the world of politics. For example, spin-focused PR could be subjected to fact-checking that will be seen by any of Google’s massive audience of news readers. Read more Pinterest adds 50 million users in one year—Pinterest’s monthly active user numbers jumped 50%, from 100 million a year ago to 150 million now. In that time, some users have added some 75 billion pins. More than half of the Pinterest’s users and 75% of new users are from outside the U.S. Men now make up 40% of the user base, up 70% from a year ago. The takeaway: Pinterest’s numbers aren’t even close to Twitter’s, but don’t let that fool you. Its influence is huge, serving 3 trillion recommendations per year. Research finds that Pinterest has an outsized influence on purchase decisions. Read more Twitter tries yet another tweak—Twitter is apparently throwing anything against the wall to see what sticks. Now it’s the possible replacement of the Moments tab with “explore, which focuses more on content discovery. Explore spotlights trending topics and search alongside the content you’ve seen in Moments. The takeaway: Focusing on discovery could help, especially with new users more easily finding content they like, but it still smells like desperation now that there seem to be no suitors for the company. Read more GE startup wants to change the way you work—Fuse is the name of a GE startup that “will test a hugely ambitious and radical approach to creating new companies through processes and technologies designed to harness the work of global crowds of experts.” The company’s approach could (according to GE) reduce the cycle time from idea to product by half “through automation of best practices and a collaborative technology platform that collectivizes and engages expert talent wherever it is.” The takeaway: There are huge changes coming to the way work is configured. Even blockchain technology will play an outsized role. Stay tuned. Read more Google buys influencer marketing company—FameBit connects brands with YouTube stars for the creation of marketing content. Google acquired the company to help it grow the number of branded opportunities and increase YouTube revenue. The takeaway: It hasn’t been hyperbole when pundits have declared influencer marketing the most important form of marketing these days. consumers pay more attention to people they know and online celebrities they follow than they do to companies and brands. I don’t doubt that we’ll see more companies crop up that help connect marketers with influencers, especially as companies recognize the value of lesser-known influencers who have sway within a niche. Read more Video Periscope lets broadcasters stream from any live-video feed—Up until now, Twitter’s Periscope required you to broadcast from your smartphone. In an effort to attract more high-quality content from brands and broadcasters, Twitter has introduced Periscope Producer, which allows broadcasters to stream any live-video feed, such as a local news broadcast or a fashion show. Not just anyone can use Producer, though; you have to apply for access. The takeaway: Whether this will help Twitter attract users and advertisers remains to be seen. Numbers are up for its Thursday night NFL broadcast, but most people just watch for a few minutes, making it a less-than-appealing proposition for advertisers. It does, however, speak to the increasing overall popularity of live-streaming video as a television alternative (which, of course, you can now watch on your TV, per the next item). Read more Facebook videos come to your TV—If you have Apple TV or Chromecast, you can watch Facebook videos on your television; it works now on iOS and the Web; Android functionality if a couple weeks away. Facebook’s support for these devices follows Twitter’s release of apps for watching video on Apple TV and Amazon Fire TV. The takeaway: The lines continue to blur between channels that once were clearly separate. Communicators need to think about how their content will work across these eroding boundaries. But wait. There’s more. Read the next item. Read more Cross-platform video ads are the new normal—Marketers are distributing video ads across a broad spectrum of devices and platforms. While obstacles remain to a full-on advertising ecosystem, the trend makes sense given eMarketer’s projection that more than 70% of Internet users will use smartphones concurrently with TV at least once a month by 2018, while those who use their computers with TV will grow to 52.8% With this kind of multitasking a common behavior, advertisers will make sure their videos spots show up in all possible viewing devices. The takeaway: See the previous two items. The lines are blurring between devices. Communicators and marketers must start thinking multichannel as the normal state of things. Read more YouTube draws debate viewers—Just in case you’re not convinced yet that the distinctions between channels are getting less important, consider that 20% fewer people watched the second U.S. presidential debate on TV than watched the first, but YouTube drew 124 million live views of the debate, a 40% increase over the first. Further, 3.2 million watched on Twitter and 7.4 million on Facebook. The takeaway: Even podcasts are now being streamed on Pandora. The medium is become far less important than the content. I wonder what Marshall McLuhan would think. Read more UPS launches new video series—A few weeks ago I reported on Kotex’s YouTube vampire series, “Carmilla.” Now UPS is joining the fray but taking the reality TV route with “The Elevator Pitch,” a three-part miniseries with contestants riding the Chicago Tribune Tower elevator while pitching a business idea to Marcus Lemonis, a billionaire host of a CNBC series. One winner in each episode will receive a $10,000 prize from The UPS Store. The takeaway: Every company is a media company. It’s a good idea to start pondering what kind of TV-like content you can deliver to YouTube (and beyond) that draws viewers, bolsters your brand, and gets people talking and sharing. Read more Trends Publishers up the personalization ante—Twenty years ago, MIT Media Lab Director Nicholas Negroponte coined the term “The Daily Me” in his book “Being Digital.” The idea was that publishers would deliver newspapers tailored entirely to each subscriber’s tastes, interests, and preferences. His vision is coming closer to reality, with publishers customizing sites based on user data. The Atlantic is one example, targeting readers with messages “based one everything from what its readers consume to the status of their subscriptions.” The takeaway: The tools are emerging for any site with a subscriber base to customize its content. What disturbs me is the lack of interest in applying these technologies to employee communications, where customization is usually limited to geographic location, business unit, and an employee’s rank in the company hierarchy. Check out the next two items for additional takes on customization. Read more Expedia recommends travel destination based on facial expressions—If you have a webcam when you’re cruising Expedia looking for a place to vacation, your facial expressions will help you find just the spot. Okay, it’s a little more specific than that. You have to visit the “Discover Your Aloha” site, and the destinations you’ll find are all in Hawaii. The takeaway: This campaign for the Hawaii Tourism Authority is a taste of what’s coming. Again, I see internal communication applications, too, gauging employee responses to initiatives, benefits changes, and other news. Read more Billboards will deliver targeted messages—At least, that’s the idea behind a Yahoo patent for a smart billboard that uses cameras, microphones, and other sensors to gather data on passers-by in order to project just the right ad. For example, detecting an expensive vehicle passing by could, along with knowing the time of day and other information, result in the billboard displaying an ad that’s relevant and appropriate to an upscale demographic. The takeaway: Just wait until the billboard can tap into your car’s digital communication system, such as Android Auto! While I find this one a bit creepy, it bolsters the notion that communication will grow increasingly personalized. Read more Big data could change crisis communications—The best crisis communication plans aren’t tooled to deal with the firehose of commentary and reporting across the digital world. Because modern crises are fueled by data, data needs to be a big part of a modern plan. “Data will reveal critical trends, patterns, and insights in the wake of a crisis to empower communications, PR, public affairs, and marketing teams.” The takeaway: I suspect a few companies will start to figure out how to integrate real-time data into crisis communications, but too many companies don’t have plans at all. (Among those that do, very few drill those plans.) Consequently, crises are going to have bigger and bigger impacts on companies as they spread and grow over digital channels. Read more Bisquick accelerates real-time marketing’s demise—There is growing evidence that real-time marketing is giving way to real-time public affairs. Bisquick’s marketing tweet during the second presidential debate demonstrates the tin-eared approach too many companies have taken to efforts to ride the coattails of cultural events. The tweet: “We’re answering your questions LIVE tonight during the debate! tweet @Bisquick or #PancakesvsWaffles to chat.” The response was less than enthusiastic. Read more New overtime regulations create internal communications challenge—The U.S. Department of Labor’s new overtime regulations could result in reclassification of many employees from salaried to hourly positions. Reactions from employees who could be subject to the status change has been mixed. The takeaway: If your company has employees who could find themselves in this situation, you need to start communicating now in order to minimize the impact on morale and productivity. Read more Advertisers spend more on social media than TV—Producing a great TV commercial was once the holy grail of advertising, but TV ad spending is declining while digital advertising is trending upward. In fact, this year digital ad spending has outpaced TV buys. Advertisers will spend $71.29 billion on TV and $72.09 billion on digital, which represents 36.8 of all media ad spending. The takeaway: The article has its own takeaway with which I completely agree: If you’re spending money on advertising, mobile is your best bet. There’s a lot of “it depends” in that statement, though, including what you’re advertising and to whom. Read more Mobile and Wearables Google is building an index just for mobile—Google’s search index covers everything, whether you’re searching on a smartphone or from your desktop. Soon, though, a search from your mobile device will use a separate mobile index that is more up-to-date. The takeaway: The transition to a mobile world continues apace. The fact that a desktop index won’t be as up-to-date as the mobile one speaks volumes. Read more SMS is a popular target for spam—Messaging’s star is rising, which makes it an appealing target for spammers. SMS text messaging is particularly vulnerable, with more than half of SMS users worldwide getting spam at least once a week; more than 25% say they receive unsolicited pitches every day. More than a quarter of mobile message app users are also receiving spam via their messaging apps at the same clip, though app users aren’t experiencing the problem to the same degree as SMS users. In fact, app users were almost twice as likely to report never receiving spam as their SMS counterparts. The takeaway: The obvious message is: Don’t send spam; build relationships instead. Also, it makes sense to focus on apps as fed-up SMS users begin making the transition just to get away from the spam. Read more Augmented messaging comes to video chat app—Tribe introduced a new version of its chat app that “listens to your conversation, and when keywords are identified—like a product, celebrity, calendar event, brand, or movie title—natural language processes convert speech to text and the words appear on the screen.” Users can tap the word to get to the Amazon listing for the item, a new calendar event, a Wikipedia page, or an Uber. The video messaging and chat company also closed a $3 million seed investment round. The takeaway: Natural language processing is going to paly a bigger and bigger role in most of our interactions with devices. Amazon’s Echo is one example, as is the new Google Assistant. Integration into video messaging is a natural next step. Have you started considering the role it could play in your brand’s offerings? Read more Snapchat makes Discover content harder to find—A small change to Snapchat’s interface has put user Stories at the top of the Stories page, moving publishers’ Discover content below your friends’ stories. If you have a lot of friends on Snapchat, you could have to scroll a ways before you find the Discover content. The takeaway: Snapchat seems to be following Facebook in its focus on user content at the expense of its paying publishers. Read more Virtual and Augmented Reality IMAX is opening a Virtual Reality Center—Movie company IMAX is opening a new VR Center for Europe, part of its move into virtual reality. Another is being opened in Los Angeles. “The facilities will offer a selection of VR experiences that range between 5 and 15 minutes and that are sourced both from Hollywood studios and game publishers.” The takeaway: VR will be everywhere. Watch for VR stations at retailers, some from the retailer itself and some from brands sold there. I can even see movie theaters with VR headsets for viewing immersive trailers. Brace yourself. Read more Facebook introduces VR emoji gestures—VR emoji are a Facebook innovation designed to convey in a virtual environment what you’re feeling. For example, shaking yur fist will turn your VR avatar’s face angry. Putting your hands on your face to express shock will produce a shocked emoji. Pump your hands in the air and your emoji will show joy. Just as emoji are attached to text messages to convey an emotion, VR emoji will “alleviate…sentiment ambiguity that exists in social VR as you don’t usually see someone’s real face.” The takeaway: Now that VR is building momentum as a consumer product, more sophisticated features will stream out of companies involved in VR’s development. Facebook and Google will be among the leaders in this space for now. Read more Apple is focusing on Augmented Reality—During a trip to Japan, Apple CEO Tim Cook confirmed that the company is more interested in Augmented than Virtual Reality “because it can enhance and amplify human experiences.” Said Cook, “We are high on AR for the long run. I think AR can be huge.” The takeaway: While there is no word on specific products, expect some serious innovation from Apple to compete with efforts from Microsoft (HoloLens) and MagicLeap, which has amassed considerable funding, including half a billion dollars from Google. Read more Research Let employees tell the values stories—Employee engagement is built, in part, on employees who are aligned with the company’s values and detect no say-do gap among leaders. But leaders telling stories about values has a significantly smaller impact on employees than hearing tales shared by their colleagues. According to a study, “stories of CEOs and leaders’ commitment, perseverance, and strength have no impact on their employees’ level of commitment to the organization’s values.” It’s the stories they hear about their co-workers that prove “to be influential means through which organizational values are embedded in newcomers’ behaviors.” The takeaway: This doesn’t mean C-level executives shouldn’t make sure employees can see that their actions are consistent with the values, nor does it mean it can’t be executives who tell the stories of their front-line staff. When a U.S. president tells the story of an ordinary citizen during the State of the Union, it can be a powerful communication technique that also demonstrates high-ranking leaders value their workers on an individual level. Communicators should also find these employee stories for sharing through a broad range of communication channels. The more they can be built into the company’s narrative, the more influential they’ll become. Read more “Gig economy” isn’t all that big yet—For several years now, we’ve been bombarded with pronouncements of the evolution to a “gig economy,” with “free agents” providing services for “sharing economy” companies like Uber and AirBnB. The number of people participating in this economy has reached 162 million, according to the McKinsey Global Institute, about 20-30% of the working age population. Don’t get too excited, though, since only 15% of independent workers have used a digital platform to earn income—only about 4% of the working-age population. The potential of the digital platforms will grow, though. The takeaway: The key is not in the numbers, but in the potential for digital platforms—which mediate between a company and a worker—could “challenge established notions of how companies are organized,” according to McKinsey.

Monday 14 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 10:07 / GMT - 06:37 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Fri Oct 14, 2016 2:59 Google's Large Pixel XL, Nexus 6P Stalk Galaxy Note 7 Demise Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- With Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 effectively dead, Google’s new phones are shaping up to be strong stand-ins. The first pure Google-branded phones could not have arrived at a better time. “Google’s new Pixel phone will be an attractive option to high-end Android phone owners,” Bob O’Donnell, president and founder of TECHnalysis Research, told me in an email. New survey not encouraging for Samsung: a new survey may be a harbinger of good news for Google (via TechCrunch) but bad news for Samsung. “The fall of the Galaxy Note 7 has Samsung’s smartphone customers seeking new brands,” the October 13 press release from e-commerce firm Branding Brand said.  The survey, conducted October 11-12, said 8% of those surveyed will buy a Google Pixel, a change since the original survey published on September 23. That’s surprising, considering the Pixel was just announced and still has relatively little exposure. The newer survey also said that 40% of current Samsung consumers say “they won’t buy another phone from the brand — that’s a 6% increase since the first week of the phone’s U.S. recall on Sept. 15,” according to Branding Brand’s press release, titled “Google Pixel Takes a Bite Out of Samsung’s Declining Consumer Base.” Results of the survey included: 8% will buy a Google Pixel (new since original survey). 30% will switch to iPhone (down from 34%). 62% will go with another Android phone (up from 57%). Pixel XL: Looking at a specific Pixel model, consumers who had been snapping up the large 5.7-inch Galaxy Note 7 before the recall could see the 5.5-inch Pixel XL as a strong option. The XL is priced at $869 (128GB), very close to the 64GB Galaxy Note 7, which is (was) priced at around $850 at most U.S. carriers. Like the Note 7, the Pixel XL comes with an AMOLED display with a 2,560-by-1440 resolution. And other internal specs are similar to the Note 7, including the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon quad-core 820 processor (which Google lists as the “821”), 4GB of RAM, a USB-C connector, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. And both have advanced 12-megapixel-class cameras. But Google is claiming chart-topping image quality, with a “best-ever” 89 DxOMark Mobile score, a widely-cited yardstick for photo quality. An often-overlooked feature of the new Google Pixel phones is the option for Project Fi, a wireless service from Google, which automatically connects you to the best available signal, whether that’s Wi-Fi or one of three 4G LTE partner networks. That can result in lower — sometimes substantially lower — monthly charges. The problem Google’s faces is supply. All versions of the Pixel XL are now listed as “out of stock.” So, as of October 14, when you order one, you are placed on a waiting list. Earlier survey points to the Nexus 6P as a beneficiary: The 5.7-inch Google Nexus 6P, co-branded with Huawei, is also a good stand-in, according to another survey. After the Note 7 recall, “the big winner was the Google Nexus 6P,” said Mobile analytics firm Apteligent. The Nexus 6P was followed by the LG G5, according to Apteligent. The Nexus 6P, like the Note 7, has a large 5.7-inch AMOLED display, and a 64GB version is available on Amazon for $500 (more or less, depending on Amazon’s pricing which can fluctuate daily), a steal for a “phablet”-class phone. iPhone 7 Plus, others may benefit too: TECHnalysis’ O’Donnell believes the shift from the Note 7 “will benefit the iPhone 7 as well.” And Morgan Stanley’s Katy Huberty said last month that “over 30% of iPhone demand in recent quarters has come from ex-Android users, and the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 battery issues and recall might drive additional demand, especially for the iPhone 7 Plus,” she said in a note to investors. Other low-cost 5.5-inch alternatives include the 64GB ZTE Axon 7 (priced on Amazon at around $500) and the 32GB Motorola Z, priced at $624 at Verizon.         LATEST STORIES (9) Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US Syrian Army Continue to Advance in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army in Battle with Terrorists in Southern Aleppo Before Winning Full Control over Region Iranian Shiites Begin Long Walk to Visit Imam Hossein's Shrine in Iraq's Karbala Syrian Army in Full Control of Dhahiyat al-Assad District in Southwestern Aleppo Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus USA: Anti-Trump Protesters March in Portland for 5th Night in a Row Terrorists Experience Great Defeat in Southern Aleppo Millions March in 4th Day of Anti-Trump Protests Putting out the Candle of the Wicked: God Never Left Syria Iraqi Forces Deploy 3 KM From Eastern Bank of Tigris River Iraqi Army Enters Key District in Eastern Mosul Iraqi Volunteer Forces' Spokesman Announces Imminent Operations to Liberate Tal Afar Syrian Army, Air Force Strike Terrorist Centers in Southwestern Damascus Portland Police Declare Curfew for Minors amid Anti-Trump Protests Anti-Trump Protests Bring People To Streets around US TEHRAN (FNA)- Chanting “Not my president” and “love trumps hate,” hundreds of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in cities across the United States to protest against President-elect Donald Trump, who they say threatens their civil and human rights.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google smartwatches are coming, but not this year Chris Smith BGR NewsOctober 15, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google unveiled a variety of new products during its early October media event, including two Pixel phones, a Google Home device for your Home, Google Wifi, and a new Chromecast Ultra dongle. But Google didn’t say anything about new wearable devices even though rumors preceding the event did say that Google is working on its own wearable devices. DON’T MISS: Here’s how Samsung might kill the Galaxy Note brand without actually killing it Well-informed Evan Blass said on Twitter that Google hasn’t given up on its smartwatch plans. But the devices, supposed to run Android Wear 2.0, will not be launched this year. Instead, they’ll be launched at some point in the first quarter of 2017. https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/786665339652157440 Google unveiled Android Wear 2.0 at Google I/O this year, but it looks like the final version of the wearable Android OS will be launched next year. Android Police, the first site that mentioned Google’s Angelfish and Swordfish watches, says that multiple companies will not release new Android Wear devices this year. It’s unclear whether Google is delaying Android Wear 2.0 because there’s no new hardware for it, or whether it’s the other way around. Google’s rumored watches do not have commercial names yet, and it's not known whether they'll be Pixel-branded. Angelfish is the larger model that will offer LTE and GPS support and will work without needing to be tethered to a phone. The Swordfish is the smaller model that will lack LTE and GPS. It’s also supposed to be cheaper than the Angelfish. Apple, meanwhile, is already selling a second-generation Apple Watch in stores, alongside an updated first-gen model. Both devices run Apple's latest watchOS 3.0 update.

 Google is turning Maps into a social platform BI Intelligence Oct. 14, 2016, 10:30 PM 10,752 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google See Also Here's what a Trump presidency means for mobile apps and platforms Apple is still struggling to keep fake apps out of the App Store What does Trump's presidency mean for the tech industry? This story was delivered to BI Intelligence Apps and Platforms Briefing subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Google will sunset photo-sharing site Panoramio as it focuses on building out features in Google Maps, Digital Trends reports. For context, Panoramio allows users to upload and share their photos by location on Google Maps and Google Earth. However, Google would like users to upload their photos using its inbuilt tool instead. The announcement is just the latest effort by the company to position Maps as a social platform and primary discovery tool, thereby making it more appealing to advertisers and marketers. Most recently, for example, Google gave users the ability to add locations and confirm suggested edits, making Maps much more personalized and accurate. Additionally, it added search ads to Maps so that local businesses surface when users make related inquiries. But Google is also relying on Maps as a driver in the artificial intelligence (AI) race,according to Google Maps head Jen Fitzpatrick. Having spent almost two decades investing in mapping endeavors, the company has accumulated massive amounts of mapping data, giving it the upper hand over the likes of Apple, Tesla, and Facebook. It makes sense that Google would base much of its future AI abilities on this data. Integrating more capabilities into Maps is one way to entice users to use the service more regularly, inputting even more data, and giving Maps even more user data to feed its AI.  To receive stories like this one directly to your inbox every morning, sign up for the Apps and Platforms Briefing newsletter. Click here to learn more about how you can gain risk-free access today.

So what can you do about it? We’re not sure if Verizon ever plans on changing their policy, but if you want a Pixel phone with an unlocked bootloader, you’ll have to buy it from Google. According to Android.WonderHowTo, they have confirmed with Google that the bootloaders on the Pixel phones bought directly from them will be unlockable. This is according to Google spokesperson Iska Saric who said, “Yes, Pixel owners who purchased the device from the Google store will be able to root their devices. Pixel phones purchased from the Google store will ship with an unlockable bootloader.” So what does this mean? As we had previously covered, an unlocked bootloader means that users will have deeper access to their phones than from before. Users will be able to do more with their phones and run tweaks/tools that might require superuser/admin privileges, such as installing custom ROMs and so on. For the average Android user who doesn’t bother with these kinds of things, we guess it probably won’t matter, but if you fancy yourself a tinkerer then perhaps purchasing the phone directly from Google might be a better idea.

    Home About Antiwar.com Donate Blog US Casualties Contact Latest News Google Reveals Secret FBI Subpoena, Reports Increase in FISA Requests Gag Order Expires, Allowing Revelation of 'National Security Letter' by Jason Ditz, October 14, 2016 Print This | Share This The FBI served Google with a “national security letter” in early 2015, the company has revealed in this week’s transparency report, and obliged the company to keep the matter secret under a gag order until now. National security letters allow the FBI to covertly subpoena data from companies without having to get a court order, so long as the requests are relevant to active investigations related to either terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. Google did not offer details beyond the existence of the letter. The report and the accompanying blog entry did, however offer other details showing growing government requests for data from Google, revealing FISA requests covering between 21,000 and 21,499 Google accounts, a significant increase from the previous year’s 16,000-16,499. The government severely limits the ability of companies to make the exact details of their surveillance public, with gag orders keeping some actions secret outright, and even Google’s data on FISA requests is only allowed in “ranges” because they’re forbidden by law from giving exact numbers.

By Ethan Baron / October 14, 2016 at 5:11 PM Donald said this and Hillary said that. Was one of them lying or distorting the truth? Both of them? Google wants to help you find out. The Mountain View company has rolled out its new fact-check links for Google News stories just in time for the election — sort of. The company received widespread media coverage for its announcement Thursday that “fact check” labels would be added to stories on the Google News mobile app. By clicking on the arrow next to a headline, readers would see a “fact check” tag beside a link to an article by a reputable fact-checking publication that has checked the facts at issue in the article. However, cursory surveys of news stories in the Google News app on Thursday and Friday found none of the new fact check tags. A Google spokeswoman said that “some stories” had the fact check tag. “But it will likely take a few weeks as other publications leverage the tag,” the spokeswoman said. So it remains to be seen how useful the new links will be in sorting out truth from fiction in advance of presidential election day Nov. 8. In any case, Google is courting political controversy by offering the feature, according to a Los Angeles Times article Friday. “Google may take criticism based on the publishers it deems eligible for its fact-check label,” the article said. Problems could arise over Google’s determination of which fact-checking publications are legitimate. While organizations dedicated to fact-checking, such as the International Fact-Checking Network, could have their tags linking to their articles, it’s over which media outlets would qualify that could generate disputes, according to the Los Angeles Times. “A Google spokeswoman said newspapers like the Los Angeles Times could use the fact-check tag. But when asked whether conservative news sites Breitbart News or progressive publication Mother Jones would be eligible, she declined to comment and referred back to the company’s guidelines,” the article said.   Photo: The campus-network room at a Google data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa.  (AP Photo/Google, Connie Zhou, File) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: App, fact check, fact checking, Google, Google News app   More Posts in 1 Petition for electoral college coup against Trump gets more than 1 million signatures November 10, 2016   Apple now selling pre-owned iPhones from online store November 9, 2016   Google’s driving app ‘Android Auto’ now works as free standalone on phones November 8, 2016       Share this Post Tweet       dalethorn Trust google to fact-check?

The phones will soon be available in stores, and Google released a couple of new TV commercials for the Pixels. Meanwhile, in Australia, a few lucky buyers have already received the phones, thanks to a delivery mistake. DON’T MISS: Here’s how Samsung might kill the Galaxy Note brand without actually killing it Google’s new Pixel commercials are somewhat on the stranger side of town. Called Together by you and Crush by you, the short ads seem to indicate that the Pixel are a natural transition from a desktop Google experience to a mobile one. In both ads, the image on the screen morphs from what looks like a browser’s search bar to a mobile phone. This is probably a subliminal hint to the Google Assistant that resides on the phones. That said, the ads do not highlight any particular feature of the Pixel phones, which is what you’d expect from such commercials, not even the Assistant. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9o9NmuZ8Qls https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0yIO_FX608 However, Google did mention one hidden feature of Google Pixel phones in a statement to WonderHowTo. The phones will be rootable out of the box. “Pixel owners who purchased the device from the Google store will be able to root their devices. Pixel phones purchased from the Google store will ship with an unlockable bootloader,” Google said. Come October 20th when the phone launches, you’ll be able to try to root the phone yourself, if you’ve got the skills. That said, at least one buyer in Australia has already received the phone ahead of launch, as local carrier Telstra made a shipping mistake.

Adam Levy (adamlevy) Oct 14, 2016 at 7:09PM Image source: Snapchat. We may be close to one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the last few years. The Wall Street Journal reports Snap, Inc. -- formerly known as Snapchat -- could make its IPO as early as March. Snap is one of the most highly valued private companies. Its last round of funding valued the company at $18 billion. The Journal says the company is eyeing a value of $25 billion or more for its IPO. Snap's decision to use the public market to raise capital is a smart move for several reasons. Here's a glimpse at Snap's possible rationale for its planned IPO. Its competition is much better capitalized Snap entered the digital advertising market just a couple years ago, and two of its biggest competitors happen to have mountains of cash on their balance sheets. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) -- the parent company of Google -- has $78.5 billion on its balance sheet. Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has $23.3 billion. For Snap to compete with the two biggest names in digital advertising, it will need to continue to innovate in both ad technology and its ad formats. That takes investments in engineers and other creatives to bring new products to market. Snap has also shown an interest in developing products outside of Snapchat. The most recent example are its Spectacles glasses, which may act as a loss leader for Snap. Snap could also use the proceeds to help acquire smaller technology companies in augmented reality. Snapchat's $25 billion valuation is likely its best way to raise capital at this point. The price represents nearly a 27 times multiple of its expected 2017 revenue. By comparison, Facebook's $81 billion IPO valued it at just 13.5 times its expected revenue. Google's $23 billion valuation at its IPO ended up being just seven times its 2004 revenue. For investors, that may be a sign that Snap will be overvalued when it makes its initial offering. However, history has shown that both Facebook and Google were dramatically undervalued, and investors would have made excellent returns by investing at their respective IPO prices. Attracting talent with stock-based compensation Love it or hate it, stock-based compensation is an important tactic used by a lot of companies that aren't yet producing tons of cash to pay their employees. Even with their significant cash flows, Facebook and Google still use a significant amount of stock-based compensation. Employees are much more attracted to company stock options that are traded on public markets. Not only are they able to see the exact market value of their stock holdings, it's easily liquidated if need be. As such, an IPO could help Snap attract more and better talent to its company in order to compete with the Facebooks and Googles of the world. There's something to be said for over-reliance on stock-based compensation, though, and investors will want to pay attention to Snapchat's numbers when it releases detailed financial reports. Relying on stock-based compensation works fine if the stock price rises, but employees aren't happy when the stock declines. They're effectively getting a pay cut when that happens, and it can cause a lot of top talent to look for work elsewhere. Attracting bigger and better customers Becoming a publicly traded company brings an air of trust that a privately held start-up just doesn't have. Publicly traded companies are required to disclose a lot more information than private companies, and give a sense that the company is much more established -- even though there are tons of well-established companies that aren't publicly traded. That's important for Snap considering it's going after the big fish in advertising. In fact, Snap is practically exclusively reliant on big-brand advertising for its ad revenue. Google and Facebook, by comparison, count millions of small businesses as active advertisers. Going public will help Snap open those wallets by giving the advertisers a sense of stability in the ad platform on which they're spending millions of dollars. That's also important because Facebook has been copying some of Snapchat's best features across several of its products. The most obvious example is Instagram's new Stories feature, which Instagram CEO Kevin Systrom even admitted was a copy. The feature already has 100 million active users. If and when Instagram decides to insert ads into stories, advertisers may be more likely to buy into it because it's backed by Facebook and its well-established reputation in the digital advertising space. Snap needs to develop a similarly strong brand and reputation. The move to take Snap public is certainly no snap decision. The company will have to disclose a lot more information as a publicly traded company, which could be beneficial to its competition. But the benefits certainly outweigh that small downside for Snap.

For more information on Servers Case Study: Protecting Privileged Accounts for a Global Manufacturer Why Lenovo for Hyperconverged? Customer Case Study - Managing Cultural Change when Moving to the Cloud What You Need to Know About Office 365 & Windows 10 Partner Offers The first Barreleye servers made use of the IBM POWER8 Turismo Single-Chip Module (SCM), while the new Zaius / Barreleye G2 servers make use of IBM POWER9 LaGrange CPUs. Two POWER9 CPUs can plug into a Zaius motherboard and each LaGrange CPU has support for up to 32 DIMM memory slots. Going a step further, the POWER9 CPUs can each support a set of 8 lanes NVLink/OpenCAPI interconnect at up to 25 Gbps. OpenCAPI is a new effort to build an Open Coherent Accelerator Processor Interface and is supported by AMD, Google, Mellanox and Micron among the group's founding members. The promise of OpenCAPI is the 25 Gbps data rate, which is faster than the current maximum throughput on PCIe, which is 16 Gbps. "OpenCAPI can advance the future of server design by enabling higher performance for data-intensive workloads and the emerging accelerator ecosystem," "Chris Johnson, Principal Engineer, Google, said in a statement. In addition to making use of the IBM POWER9 LaGrange CPU and OpenCAPI, Zaius will also make use of new Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) technology. "The Zaius BMC software is being developed using Open BMC, the framework for which we’ve released on GitHub," John Zipfel, Technical Program Manager at Google, wrote in a blog post. "Additionally, Zaius will support a PCIe Gen4 x16 OCP 2.0 mezzanine slot NIC." The draft design of the Zaius has been shared with the Open Compute Platform (OCP) community and could become a standard future reference design.

OEMs still have the option of including Hangouts, but are no longer required to do so and will have to replace it with Duo, Google’s video calling app. Now it seems that Google themselves are following the new rules that they have set out because according to a report from Chrome Unboxed, they have obtained a screenshot from the upcoming Pixel phones which shows that Google Hangouts has been disabled on the phone in favor of both Allo and Duo. Now the disabling of Hangouts doesn’t really mean that much. Users can quickly re-enable the app via the Play Store, so it’s just a slight inconvenience at most, although we’re guessing that users who are less savvy might be frustrated when they try to look for the app. Now Google has stated that Hangouts will be aimed more towards its business users so this move isn’t all that surprising. However like we said, for those who still use Hangouts, the app will still be there and Google isn’t going to shut it down, it’s just that its presence on Android may no longer be as prominent as it once was.

But the L-G’s probe report has found that the project catered to audience in other states.  The Arvind Kejriwal-led government has been jostling with the Centre for control on land, police and administrative powers over the bureaucracy that is currently in the hands of the L-G who reports to the union home ministry.  The Delhi High Court said in August that LG is the administrative head of the Capital and the state government must consult him on all decisions.  The Arvind Kejriwal-led government has been jostling with the Centre for control on land, police and administrative powers over the bureaucracy The Aam Aadmi Party government challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, which will hear the final arguments on November 15.  Following the High Court ruling in his favour, Jung formed the three-member panel to scan files to check “irregularities” and “infirmities” in Delhi government decisions over the past 18 months.  There is no justification on file as to why the (advertisement) programme is being done.  "No public purpose seems to be served to the citizens of Delhi as the target audience is from other states, i.e Punjab, Gujarat, Goa where elections are scheduled in early 2017,” the probe report notes.  A breakdown of the spending showed Rs 60 lakh was ear-marked for Facebook to reach 1.8 crore voting-age people in Delhi, Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat.  Another Rs 25 lakh was set aside for YouTube promotions to reach out to a pan-India audience of around 20 lakh.  According to official papers, Rs 20 lakh each were budgeted for the Google Display Network and Facebook post-event plans.  The probe report has discovered the contract for the campaign was handed out to a PR firm, Perfect Relations, without any open bidding.  Despite being sent a written questionnaire, AAP did not respond to the specific findings of the L-G’s probe report.  But during a press conference Delhi’s Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said: “They don’t want us to work, so they have made this committee. The setting up of the committee itself is not legally correct.”  When contacted, the management of Perfect Relations said they had carried out the mandate that they had been given by the Delhi government and would not like to comment on the draft probe report.  India Today TV has learnt that a private complaint has also been filed with the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is expected to begin a preliminary inquiry soon.  Separately, Jung’s office is also probing the appointment of Dr Nikunj Aggarwal as officer on special duty to Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain. Dr Aggarwal is the son-in-law of the sister-in-law of CM Kejriwal and thus the appointment has elevated curiosity.  He was first appointed as a senior resident doctor for orthopedics. What makes his appointment, at the Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, suspicious is that it came at a time when no such post was vacant in the institute.  “Posts are filled through advertising, but in the instant case, the appointment was done without any advertisement,” notes the draft probe report of the three-member Shunglu committee. A vacant position of faculty in the orthopedics department was adjusted to make way for the entry of Kejriwal’s relative, it states.

Share this article Share 82 shares Also, the appointment of Dr Aggarwal was done on the basis of a simple hand-written application, without government norms being followed, according to the report.  Within three months, Dr Nikunj Aggarwal was then appointed as the OSD to health minister Jain.  What has raised the hackles of the probe team was a state-sponsored programme for Dr Aggarwal at a top institute.  According to official documents, he was sent, on government expense of Rs 1.15 lakh, to a management-development programme for senior healthcare officials at IIM Ahmedabad.  “Being a senior resident (ad hoc), Dr Aggarwal was not entitled to participate in such types of training at government expense as per residency scheme of the hospital,” says the probe report.  It has also found discrepancies in an order dated July 2016 of the department of health and family welfare, which approved government expenses for his trip to Beijing to attend the China Sinopharm International Corporation.   Manish Sisodia quizzed for two-hours by Anti-Corruption Bureau By PTI  The Anti-Corruption Branch questioned deputy CM Manish Sisodia for over two hours The Anti-Corruption Branch on Friday questioned deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia for over two hours, in connection with its probe into an alleged recruitment scam in Delhi Commission for Women (DCW).  Sisodia was summoned by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) on October 7, informing him about the questioning. The Deputy CM arrived around 11 am at the ACB office, and his questioning continued for over two hours, said a senior ACB officer.  “In the documents that were probed by the ACB, it was found that there was a letter from the office of Sisodia that had authorised DCW as a body with financial autonomy.  As per rules, only the L-G can grant financial autonomy to a body. We will be questioning him on this aspect,” an official had said.  Sisodia said that the questioning was based solely on a clarification note he had signed, adding the whole affair was aimed to stop the government’s public welfare work.  “How do I become a criminal just for writing a clarification note (on an official file)? When I asked them, they (Anti Corruption Branch) had no answer,” Sisodia said. The ACB has been probing the matter for the last few months and based on the questioning of Maliwal’s staff, it was found that due procedure was not followed in appointments and an FIR under relevant section of Prevention of Corruption Act and sections 409 (criminal breach of trust) and 120B (punishment of criminal conspiracy) of the IPC was registered against her. Meanwhile, DCW chief Swati Maliwal termed ACB’s summoning of Sisodia as political vendetta. “ACB summoning @msisodia reeks of political vendetta. He has no role in DCW appointments. DCW was always autonomous. Sad.  ACB pursuing false case against me, not taking action on my corruption complain against Shiela Dixit for past 3 weeks (sic),” Maliwal said.    AAP wants Shunglu probe committee dissolved The Aam Aadmi Party government and Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung are at loggerheads again as the Delhi Cabinet on Friday ‘advised’ Jung to dissolve the Shunglu Committee set up by him to examine 400 files pertaining to decisions the AAP dispensation has taken since coming to power.  The AAP government advised Jung to desist from derailing public welfare measures.  “The Cabinet noted that there is no provision in the Constitution or in any statute or rule which empowers setting up of an external committee to inquire into the ongoing projects of public welfare, question officers and threaten to recommend criminal and administrative action against them,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said.  AAP wants the Shunglu probe committee to be dissolved as the L-G has no power Sisodia requested L-G Jung to return all the files of the government, saying “various important works are being affected” due to this. “The Committee has created a dangerous climate of fear and uncertainty among the bureaucracy, thus threatening to derail government functioning in its entirety,” he said.  “We have requested the L-G to dissolve the committee as the L-G has no power. The jurisdiction of LG is well defined under Article 239AA of Constitution of India, the GNCTD Act, 1991, and the rules framed under the Act,” he said.  If the committee continues its “illegal” functioning, not only will it imperil public welfare, it has also the potential to create a serious constitutional crisis in the national Capital, according to the deputy CM.  Sisodia said “impounding” of over 400 files by L-G is against the transaction of business rules and GNCTD Act. “Cabinet also brought to the notice of the L-G that the August 4 Delhi High Court judgment, which is being invoked by him to take such action, has not become final and is presently under challenge before the Supreme Court,” he said.  The Shunglu Committee is expected to submit its report within the next six weeks, officials said.     Now 14th MLA arrested, this one for assault   AAP MLA Naresh Balyan, was arrested in connection with an alleged assault case The AAM Aadmi Party MLA from Uttam Nagar, Naresh Balyan, was on Friday arrested in connection with an alleged assault case where he and an associate were accused of roughing up an RWA president.  Balyan is the 14th MLA from the party to be arrested since it came to power early last year.  “The arrest was made on Friday evening. We had called him to the police station along with Mahaveer Fauji,, his co-accused in the case After questioning the two, we arrested them,” said DCP (West) Vijay Kumar. The case was registered on October 8 after former AAP volunteer and president of Mohan Garden RWA Henry George filed a complaint, alleging that Balyan and his associates entered his office, attacked him and threatened him.  A case has been lodged under sections 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint), 451 (assault) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. Meanwhile, a non-bailable warrant has been issued against AAP MLA from Matiala, Gulab Singh, for failing to join theprobe in a case of extortion involving his associates.    27 AAP MLAs in new office-of-profit row   Trouble has mounted for Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party after President Pranab Mukherjee advised the Election Commission to investigate a complaint that 27 AAP MLAs held an office of profit, official sources said.  The proposed probe is separate from the earlier office-of- profit accusations against 21 party MLAs over their appointment as parliamentary secretaries.  In June, a law student, Vibhor Anand, wrote to the Election Commission, alleging Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal named 27 MLAs as chair of Delhi’s Rogi Kalyan Samiti to monitor the working of various state-run hospitals.  Alka Lamba's name appears in the list of MLAs holding office -of-profit Anand demanded termination of the defendants’ role as MLAs, alleging heading the organisation amounted to holding an office of profit.  MLAs, he claimed, could only become members of the Samiti and not its chairpersons.  Somnath Bharti (left) and Jarnail Singh (right) are in the list 27 MLAs allegedly violating the norms  Among the 27 MLAs Anand cited in his complaint, 10 already are accused of violating the office-of-profit norms as parliamentary secretaries.  Last month, the Election Commission forwarded Anand’s letter to the President, who has now advised the election watchdog to probe the allegations against the MLAs.  According to the law student’s complaint, following MLAs were appointed chair of the Rogi Kalyan Samiti.  Read more: India News - Latest Headlines, Pictures and Videos | Daily Mail Online Share or comment on this article e-mail 82 shares Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search     DON'T MISS 'Why are you in, miss?

In its latest Transparency Report, Google revealed that Indian law enforcement agencies had made 3,452 requests to get access to user data during January-June period this year. The requests affected 6,207 users (accounts) with Google producing information for 55 per cent of the requests. While the number of requests for user data being made by India has been steadily on the rise, it's in line with global trends. Moreover, as India's base of internet users grows, cybercrime is on the rise and agencies are increasingly turning to digital logs to prosecute offenders. India has been among the top five countries in requesting user data from Google since 2009, which is as far back as the company will go to reveal data for requests made by governments. The data reveal that requests from governments across the globe have been increasing by around 5,000 on a half-yearly basis over the past two years. The US, France, Germany, the UK, and Brazil have been some of the top requesters of user data, alongside India. In the January-June period, 44,943 requests were made to Google to reveal user data, up from 40,677 requests in the July-December period last year. During the first half of this year, India ranked fourth among countries in making such requests. In July-December 2015, India was fifth. India's internet user base has grown from around 90 million in 2010 to nearly half a billion in 2016 and this growth remains steady with the increasing penetration of smartphones. Over 200 million Indians own smartphones today and that number is expected to hit half a billion by 2020, say analysts. While it cannot be ascertained why the Indian government made requests to get access to sensitive user data, majority of these could be made by law enforcement agencies with regard to crimes committed. However, as seen with the Edward Snowden leaks, governments often misuse data from technology firms such as Google to spy on civilians. Edward Snowden, a former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor, now lives in Russia after fleeing the US via Hong Kong in May, having revealed extensive internet and phone surveillance by US intelligence. The US continues to lead the pack with 14,168 requests for user data being made during the January-June period this year. Germany and France have stepped up their data requests over the past year, probably owing to the slew of terrorist attacks that shocked Europe recently. As internet penetration grows across the globe, more governments are turning to digital trails to prevent and solve crime while also keeping a close watch on suspects. Google's report shows this trend, but doesn't necessarily reflect the extent to which digital surveillance is done.

It allows millions of people, every day, to find their way, share directions, and so much more. The usefulness of Google Maps extends far beyond the features you find on the site. I admit that I’m a Google fanboy. The biggest reason for that is that Google services are so well intertwined that you can accomplish almost any integration you can imagine. This is also true with Google Maps. It’s a cinch to integrate Google Maps with other Google services like Google Now, Google Drive, Google Docs & Sheets, and even Gmail. In this article, I’ll show you some useful ways to take advantage of these simple integrations. 1. Google Now and Maps Just about every smartphone on the planet has GPS capability. If you have Google Now installed on your phone, you have access to some really cool Google Maps features. For example, Google Now will remind you where you parked your car, using a Google Maps location. Ads by Google If you’re looking for a business nearby your current location, Google Now can help you with that too. Just ask for nearby coffee shops, gas stations, or whatever, and you’ll get a map with all locations plotted out. There’s no need to do any funky integration or hacking. So long as you have Google Now installed, and location services enabled on your phone, you can take advantage of all of these Google Maps features on your Google Now app. 2. Google Drive If you have a Google account, then the odds are pretty good that you probably use Google Drive frequently. Did you know that you can create and organize Google maps from within your Drive account? To create a new map, click on New> More > Google My Maps. This takes you to a Google Maps page where you can plot out locations within different layers. When you finish creating your map, just close the tab. All changes are automatically saved to your Google Drive account. Make sure to give a name to the map that you’ll remember! You’ll find the map you’ve created in your Google Drive account. You can sort your maps into different folders. This organization is useful for something like planning a family trip as you can keep all travel maps in the same folder. Creating and organizing all maps from Google Drive is a pretty convenient way to do productive things like: Plan your family vacation. Organize your next camping and hiking trip. Save a map of all your favorite dining spots. Create a map to your party to share with all your friends. The Google Maps integration with Google Drive is probably one of the most convenient ways you can make use of Google Maps in your life with very little effort. Give it a try! 3. Embed Into a Google Site If you use Google Sites to publish a web page, you can embed Google Maps into your pages without much effort at all (or coding for that matter). In edit mode on your site, just click on Insert, and then Map. In the next screen, you can simply type the address you want to display on your web page. You’ll see a preview of the map in the bottom pane. On the next screen, adjust how the map will get embedded into your webpage. You can adjust the width and height, and whether it’ll get embedded with or without a border. Click Save and you’ll see your map embedded right where you placed it on the page. No coding required and no special external add-ins or widgets required. Just a few simple steps and you have an embedded Google Map right on your web page. If you want one of your customized maps that you’ve created in My Maps, you can click on My Maps instead of Maps on the Insert page. You’ll see a list of all maps stored in your Google Drive account. Just select one of the customized maps and embed it into your Google Sites page. 4. Use Maps With Google Sheets Not long ago, we showed several ways that you can convert spreadsheet addresses into a Google Map. These mostly include using a KML file to transfer over the address data to Google Maps. Not a bad way to accomplish it, but there’s an easier way. The first thing to do is install the Mapping Sheets add-on. Once installed, from inside sheets you can click Add-ons, Mapping Sheets, and Start Mapping. You’ll see the Mapping Sheets pop-up window on the left side of the spreadsheet. Once you have the map data in your spreadsheet (using whatever headers you want for Title, Filter and Location), you can click on the View button at the bottom of the add-on window. This will instantly map and pin all of those addresses to Google Maps. Of course, if you prefer not using an add-on, you can also use the Import feature in My Places to import map data directly from a Google Sheet. Nancy wrote a guide on how to do this. It takes a few extra steps, but you already have everything you need to get it done right now. 5. Embed Maps in Docs and Gmail Google Docs used to have a gadget that would allow you to embed a Google map How To Embed YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, And Google Maps Responsively How To Embed YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram, And Google Maps Responsively One of the biggest buzzwords in the online design world in the past two or three years has to be 'Responsive.' With the advent of browsing on everything from a 4 inch smartphone screen to... Read More based on spreadsheet location parameters. That gadget is no longer available. There is similarly no way to embed a map into any email you’re composing using Gmail. There is a very simple solution to share your maps with people via a Google Doc or an email. Create an image of the map you’ve created, which you can embed in either place. Google provides an API for developers to accept a URL with location parameters, and the API returns a Google Maps image of that location. This is a really cool API and great for Google Maps developers How Does Google Maps Work? [Technology Explained] How Does Google Maps Work? [Technology Explained] Read More . However, if you aren’t a programmer and you don’t have an API key, then you’re out of luck. Sure, you could sign up for a key, but if you only plan to use this once or twice, is it really worth it? Probably not. A simpler solution is to use a tool provided online by developers out there on the web. One example of these is the Google Maps Image generator provided at Prodraw. Use Prodraw to type in the address of the map you want to embed and any image parameters like size and map type. Once you submit, you’ll see an image of the map you wanted, as well as several embed scripts below it. You have the option to use a URL pointing directly to the Google Maps static image, an image embed code for a website, or image forum code for embedding in an online forum. Or you can right click on the map itself and just save it as an image file on your computer. For embedding into Google Docs or Gmail, this is the best choice. In Google Docs, just click on Insert and then Image… This will embed the map image right into your document. In Gmail, you just click the Insert Photo tool when you’re composing a new email, and upload the image from your computer. It’ll embed the image right into your email. It isn’t the most ingenious way to embed a Google Map into your document or email. But it does the trick and the end result looks great. No coding required. Another useful online tool you can use to generate static map images like this is Static Map Maker. This not only lets you embed Google maps, but also maps from Bing, MapQuest, Mapbox, and more. Using Google Maps Everywhere A map is a very useful tool for a lot of things you may do every day. Whether it’s sending someone directions to your house, explaining something about a location in a document, or saving maps to your Google Drive account for your upcoming family trip — maps are very handy.

Richard Gingras, head of Google News, announced Thursday in a blog post that fact checks will be differentiated from other articles in the expanded story box on news.google.com and in the Google News & Weather iOS and Android apps. The new feature is aimed at helping people find fact checks "in large news stories," he said. Google will use website code and a site's reputation for fact checks to determine whether a story qualifies for the new tag. "We're excited to see the growth of the fact-check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin," Gingras said. © 2016 Cox Media Group.

As such, Google is adding a fact check tag to articles on news.google.com, where they will appear in the expanded story box, and on the Google News & Weather iOS and Android apps. The feature joins existing tags used by Google’s news service, such as Opinion, In-depth, Highly Cited, and the recently added Local Source. The search giant says the growth of fact-checking organizations like the International Fact-Checking Network also prompted it to introduce the tag. Google will look for the schema.org ClaimReview markup to determine if sites contain fact checks. Additionally, Google makes sure that the pages follow certain criteria for fact checks, which include: “Discrete claims and checks must be easily identified in the body of fact-check articles. Readers should be able to understand what was checked, and what conclusions were reached.” If Google finds a site that doesn’t meet the criteria for the ClaimReview markup, it may ignore the markup or remove the site from Google News. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” the company said in its blog post. Some of the sites already using the new markup include political fact-checker Politifact.com, and the UK-based independent fact-checking charity Full Fact. So far, fewer than ten domains are currently using the feature. With less than a month to go and just one more debate to get through before voting begins, it’s a shame Google didn’t introduce the fact-checking tag sooner.

Naturally, the company is adapting to change — it is already prioritizing mobile-friendly sites in search results, it’s done work in voice recognition, launched the AMP project for fast loading mobile web pages, it indexes apps and so on. According to a report by Search Engine Land, the next such effort will be creating a completely separate mobile index, which will eventually take priority over the original desktop one. Google’s trend analyst Gary Illyes announced the news at Pubcon, noting that the mobile index will be fully implemented “within months” — though no specific timeline was given. Google will still have a desktop index, it just won’t be as fresh as the mobile index. It’s unclear exactly how the mobile index will work. Search Engine Land argues that the mobile index may allow Google to use its ranking algorithm differently for mobile content, rather than relying on data from desktop content to rank mobile sites. The news naturally raised some concerns that search results may end up being less comprehensive, as mobile sites often remove content and structured data to optimize for size. Google has yet to announce anything officially. The move will increase the pressure on online publishers to make sure their sites are mobile friendly, and that their mobile and desktop sites show the same content to be properly indexed, though the writing has been on the wall for some time for non mobile-optimized sites.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Find fact check articles faster in Google News Brittany A. Roston - Oct 14, 2016 2 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google is making it easier to find fact-check articles in Google News by labelling them as such. Claims made during political debates, in social tweets and more are often subject to fact-check organizations. Finding fact-check articles can be difficult, however, and for this reason Google has started labelling them with a new ‘fact check’ tag when they appear in Google News. Google points toward dedicated fact checking networks and similar entities as part of the collective that has made fact checking a big thing. More than 100 sites engage in fact checking, according to Duke University, but locating this content isn’t always easy, as it tends to get lost in the content glut. Google’s latest tag, to some degree, changes that. The company’s news website regularly labels different content types, and it now tags fact-check articles, too. Fact-check articles appearing in Google News display a small ‘Fact Check’ tag as shown in the screenshot above. Clicking one of these tagged articles takes users to a fact-check destination scrutinizing the topic or claims.. These tagged fact check articles appear only in expanded news boxes on Google News, and only for large news stories, at least for now. The new article type tag is rolling out initially in the United States and the United Kingdom, says Google. You should see now in the Google News & Weather app for Android and iOS if you’re in either of those two countries.

Article :  Bluetooth, Seeing IoT Growth, Seeks to Build on a Successful Standard Verizon May Seek Changes or Exit Yahoo Deal Carl Weinschenk |   Data and Telecom   |   Posted 14 Oct, 2016          |         |     Share The huge data breach that compromised as many as 500,000 user accounts was bad news on a number of fronts for Yahoo. The aggravation stemming from the hack continues as Verizon suggests that it may back out of or seek changes to the $4.8 billion deal to buy Yahoo. Yesterday, Verizon General Counsel Craig Silliman said that the hack could have “material impact” on the deal and give it reason to exit or restructure the transaction, according to Computerworld. Yahoo stands by the value of the company, while Verizon is seeking to reduce the acquisition price by $1 billion. Best of Frien-emies: Google Google has declared itself a “frien-emy" of the established carriers. Light Reading reports that Google says that its broadband networking activities make it a competitor to telephone companies in only a minority of cases. Indeed, Mike Blanche, the head of Strategic Relationships for Google, told an audience at the Ovum Digital Futures conference that Google considers itself to be 80 percent partner, 5 percent competitor, and 10 percent supplier to telcos. Blanche’s comments, says the article, which are similar to those he has made in the past, are intended to assuage telco concerns. The concerns have existed since Google Fiber was created in 2012. Transportation Department: $65M in Grants Though it may seem a bit contradictory, one of the biggest drivers of innovation is the same government that is often accused of being bloated and lethargic. This week, the U.S. Department of Transportation announced $65 million in grants through initiatives from the Advanced Transportation and Congestion Management Technologies Deployment (ATCMTD) program and Mobility on Demand (MOD) Sandbox program.  The programs are run by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Federal Transit Administration (FTA), respectively. The grants will be leveraged to total almost $170 million in public and private investment, the press release says. The ATCMTD program will use the funding to help communities use technology to enhance mobility. The projects will increase the efficiency of the highway system. The MOD program is part of the U.S. DOT’s effort to explore the “potential of integrating public and private transportation choices,” the press release says. The Galaxy Note 7 Has Come to This: Fireproof Boxes The depth of the disaster that the Galaxy Note 7 has proven to be for Samsung can be summed up by one fact: Samsung, according to Reuters, is sending out fireproof boxes for returns of Note 7 devices. The bad news keeps coming. The faulty Note 7s will cost Samsung billions of dollars, and harder to quantify humiliation. Reuters reports that the carrier is taking no chances with the devices, which were released two months ago. The boxes come after some of those phones – and some replacements – went up in smoke. Indeed, this is not the type of paragraph that marketing departments enjoy reading: A YouTube video by Android developer news site XDA Developers on Tuesday showed a "return kit," including a fireproof box with a "forbidden for transport by aircraft" warning and blue gloves to handle the device. It remains to be seen whether the incident will damage the company’s reputation in the long haul. Chances are pretty good, however, that the story will remain “hot” for quite some time. Gartner: 3D Printer Shipments on the Fast Track Gartner found that 3D printer shipments will total 455,772 this year. That is a 108 percent increase compared to last year’s 219,168 units that shipped in 2015. Gartner predicts that 6.7 million units will ship in 2020. Datamation suggests that shipments of enterprise-graded 3D printers will grow 44 percent this year. Among the drivers are manufacturers’ increasing use of the devices for prototyping and as-needed production. Carl Weinschenk covers telecom for IT Business Edge.

If youve never used a keyboard in VR before, you can try to use Samsungs Gear VR keyboard to get an idea. A dot remains in the center of your view, acting as a cursor. Then, the user points their head onto each individual letter and taps the touchpad on the Gear VR headset to input a character. The layout for this keyboard looks much like the Google Keyboard that comes stock on Nexus devices, as well as this years Moto smartphones. Daydream Keyboard - Google Play Store You might not be able to install it, however, as Google notes that the Daydream keyboard is only compatible with Daydream-ready phones and uninstalling the Daydream keyboard could cause some Daydream apps to force-close. If youre a Nexus 6P owner, however, you may be pleased to find that the Daydream Keyboard is installable on the Huawei-made Nexus device (as per Android Police, considering Google said existing smartphones most likely will not work with Daydream. The Daydream View headset will be available on the Play Store, Verizon, and Best Buy stores starting in November in the US. Remember, if you pre-ordered a Pixel (XL) device, you should have gotten an email regarding a free Daydream View via a promo code.

daniel.haxx.se Search Primary Menu Skip to content About Contact Search for: c-ares, Security a single byte write opened a root execution exploit October 14, 2016 Daniel Stenberg 7 Comments Thursday, September 22nd 2016. An email popped up in my inbox. Subject: ares_create_query OOB write As one of the maintainers of the c-ares project I’m receiving mails for suspected security problems in c-ares and this was such a one. In this case, the email with said subject came from an individual who had reported a ChromeOS exploit to Google. It turned out that this particular c-ares flaw was one important step in a sequence of necessary procedures that when followed could let the user execute code on ChromeOS from JavaScript – as the root user. I suspect that is pretty much the worst possible exploit of ChromeOS that can be done. I presume the reporter will get a fair amount of bug bounty reward for this. The setup and explanation on how this was accomplished is very complicated and I am deeply impressed by how this was figured out, tracked down and eventually exploited in a repeatable fashion. But bear with me. Here comes a very simplified explanation on how a single byte buffer overwrite with a fixed value could end up aiding running exploit code as root. The main Google bug for this problem is still not open since they still have pending mitigations to perform, but since the c-ares issue has been fixed I’ve been told that it is fine to talk about this publicly. c-ares writes a 1 outside its buffer c-ares has a function called ares_create_query. It was added in 1.10 (released in May 2013) as an updated version of the older function ares_mkquery. This detail is mostly interesting because Google uses an older version than 1.10 of c-ares so in their case the flaw is in the old function. This is the two functions that contain the problem we’re discussing today. It used to be in the ares_mkquery function but was moved over to ares_create_query a few years ago (and the new function got an additional argument). The code was mostly unchanged in the move so the bug was just carried over. This bug was actually already present in the original ares project that I forked and created c-ares from, back in October 2003. It just took this long for someone to figure it out and report it! I won’t bore you with exactly what these functions do, but we can stick to the simple fact that they take a name string as input, allocate a memory area for the outgoing packet with DNS protocol data and return that newly allocated memory area and its length. Due to a logic mistake in the function, you could trick the function to allocate a too short buffer by passing in a string with an escaped trailing dot. An input string like “one.two.three\.” would then cause the allocated memory area to be one byte too small and the last byte would be written outside of the allocated memory area. A buffer overflow if you want. The single byte written outside of the memory area is most commonly a 1 due to how the DNS protocol data is laid out in that packet. This flaw was given the name CVE-2016-5180 and was fixed and announced to the world in the end of September 2016 when c-ares 1.12.0 shipped. The actual commit that fixed it is here. What to do with a 1? Ok, so a function can be made to write a single byte to the value of 1 outside of its allocated buffer. How do you turn that into your advantage? The Redhat security team deemed this problem to be of “Moderate security impact” so they clearly do not think you can do a lot of harm with it. But behold, with the right amount of imagination and luck you certainly can! Back to ChromeOS we go. First, we need to know that ChromeOS runs an internal HTTP proxy which is very liberal in what it accepts – this is the software that uses c-ares. This proxy is a key component that the attacker needed to tickle really badly. So by figuring out how you can send the correctly crafted request to the proxy, it would send the right string to c-ares and write a 1 outside its heap buffer. ChromeOS uses dlmalloc for managing the heap memory. Each time the program allocates memory, it will get a pointer back to the request memory region, and dlmalloc will put a small header of its own just before that memory region for its own purpose. If you ask for N bytes with malloc, dlmalloc will use ( header size + N ) and return the pointer to the N bytes the application asked for. Like this: With a series of cleverly crafted HTTP requests of various sizes to the proxy, the attacker managed to create a hole of freed memory where he then reliably makes the c-ares allocated memory to end up. He knows exactly how the ChromeOS dlmalloc system works and its best-fit allocator, how big the c-ares malloc will be and thus where the overwritten 1 will end up. When the byte 1 is written after the memory, it is written into the header of the next memory chunk handled by dlmalloc: The specific byte of that following dlmalloc header that it writes to, is used for flags and the lowest bits of size of that allocated chunk of memory. Writing 1 to that byte clears 2 flags, sets one flag and clears the lowest bits of the chunk size. The important flag it sets is called prev_inuse and is used by dlmalloc to tell if it can merge adjacent areas on free. (so, if the value 1 simply had been a 2 instead, this flaw could not have been exploited this way!) When the c-ares buffer that had overflowed is then freed again, dlmalloc gets fooled into consolidating that buffer with the subsequent one in memory (since it had toggled that bit) and thus the larger piece of assumed-to-be-free memory is partly still being in use. Open for manipulations! Using that memory buffer mess This freed memory area whose end part is actually still being used opened up the play-field for more “fun”. With doing another creative HTTP request, that memory block would be allocated and used to store new data into. The attacker managed to insert the right data in that further end of the data block, the one that was still used by another part of the program, mostly since the proxy pretty much allowed anything to get crammed into the request. The attacker managed to put his own code to execute in there and after a few more steps he ran whatever he wanted as root. Well, the user would have to get tricked into running a particular JavaScript but still… I cannot even imagine how long time it must have taken to make this exploit and how much work and sweat that were spent. The report I read on this was 37 very detailed pages. And it was one of the best things I’ve read in a long while! When this goes public in the future, I hope at least parts of that description will become available for you as well. A lesson to take away from this? No matter how limited or harmless a flaw may appear at a first glance, it can serve a malicious purpose and serve as one little step in a long chain of events to attack a system. And there are skilled people out there, ready to figure out all the necessary steps. c-aresSecurity Post navigation Previous Postpoll on mac 10.12 is brokenNext Postcurl up in Nuremberg! 7 thoughts on “a single byte write opened a root execution exploit” Riking says: October 14, 2016 at 22:53 > Well, the user would have to get tricked into running a particular JavaScript but still… This is so easy to do, though, that the Chrome VRP considers it a given – you start from “load the attacker’s webpage”.

(Altwork) SAN FRANCISCO – Che Voigt believes his company has solved problems that have plagued the working world since the advent of typing. It’s a solution to hunched backs, stiff necks and tight shoulders. It’s a workstation that, with a push of a button, transitions from a standing desk to a seated table to a fully reclined platform like a dentist’s chair. Its seat expands and retracts, supporting the whole body from head to heels. Its desk moves up, down and rotates. There’s a screen and mouse and keyboard that follows the user’s eyes and hands. It’s the way of the future, he says; the most comfortable you can possible be working at a computer. And it starts at $5,900. Before anyone scoffs, Voigt has a defense: 1) Don’t knock it until you’ve tried it, and 2) If people don’t invest in ergonomics now, they’ll pay for it later. And if Silicon Valley’s track record is anything to go by, Voigt might be onto something. Tech firms have long embraced wacky inventions that promise heightened productivity and creativity – and the industry has a history of making them mainstream. Height-adjustable desks and $1,000 Herman Miller chairs that once seemed extravagant are no longer common just at software startups; schools, government agencies and even the White House have gotten on board. Whether it’s open floor plans, ergonomic keyboards or yoga ball chairs, workplaces far removed from the tech world often co-opt the quirky and often costly office cultures of firms like Apple, Google and Facebook in hope that some of their success rubs off. “Comfort is material to creativity,” said Voigt, 45, chief executive of Altwork, a company that builds each workstation by hand in a barn on a 65-acre family property shared with Zinfandel wine grapes in California’s Sonoma County. “If you’re stressed or distressed, the mind can’t fall into creativity. We want to get into an area where you can be productive and do really good work.” Twenty years ago, ergonomics was about finding a decent office chair and doing the occasional stretch throughout the day, said Joy Boese, an ergonomics specialist at E3 Consulting who has worked with companies such as Toyota and Netflix. It was considered an office perk, something filed in the “nice to have” category. Today, particularly in tech land, it’s expected. “Now it’s about tracking your health, tracking your steps, seeing how you spend your day, integrating fitness desks, treadmill desks, Zen rooms for people to take a moment to rest their mind,” Boese said. “These companies want people to feel like it’s more than just coming to work – they want a happy, healthy, engaged workforce.” Silicon Valley is at the forefront of this, Boese said, which is no surprise, given that it is traditionally “two to three years ahead of the curve.” But it’s also characteristic of the Valley’s ruthless optimization and productivity ethos. It was software engineers who popularized Soylent, the liquid meal replacement for techies. It was tech CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs who streamlined their wardrobes into a uniform, a move that Zuckerberg has justified saying it helped “clear my life so that I have to make as few decisions as possible . on things that are silly or frivolous.” And it was the tech world that normalized “lockdowns” – intense work periods when employees don’t leave the office until a project is done. These cultural quirks reflect the immense pressure that many tech workers face to deliver big projects on tight deadlines, justifying not only their own salaries but also their companies’ lofty valuations. The Altwork Station is designed for these people, said Voigt, who describes them as “high-intensity computer users.” “Being comfortable at your desk is really important,” said Helen Wu, director of growth partnerships at San Francisco tech firm AppLovin, where every employee can choose between a sitting or standing desk and request ergonomic gadgets. Wu herself doesn’t have an Altwork Station, but she uses a laptop stand on her desk, an ergonomic keyboard and a Handshoe mouse – a wireless gadget that looks like a fedora made for aliens – from the Netherlands. “Having a setup where you don’t have to worry about your physiology lets you focus on your work,” she said. The tech industry isn’t unique when it comes to valuing productivity. Wall Street, which has a reputation for brutal efficiency and long hours, has also invested in ergonomics. What sets Silicon Valley apart, according to ergonomics specialists who have worked with both industries, is its lack of self-consciousness and its willingness to go all-in. That’s why five-toe shoes (with separate nooks for each toe, like a glove for the foot) and telepresence robots – tablet computers on rolling pedestals that offer off-site employees an in-person presence – are not uncommon on tech campuses, but remain rare in New York’s Financial District. “We worked with a brokerage firm to redesign their office into an open plan space, and it was hard to get people out of private offices,” said Melissa Steach, an ergonomics specialist at Herman Miller, the furniture firm whose midcentury designs are now ubiquitous in the tech industry. “There was a lot of ego attached to it, the whole ‘I’m a baller, I’ve earned this office and you don’t have one.'” Silicon Valley, meanwhile, isn’t wary of workplace weirdness. It has embraced it – reclining chairs, bike-pedal footstools, treadmill desks and all. (EDITORS: STORY CAN END HERE) There’s a copycat element to it too, said Michael Lukasik, a brand development manager for West Elm Workspace, an arm of the housewares business that furnishes offices. Startups often express Google-shaped aspirations even if their businesses couldn’t be further from Google’s. “These smaller companies are coming to us and saying, ‘We saw images of Google’s offices – can you help us accomplish this?'” Lukasik said. “Everyone wants to attract the same talent that Google or Apple attracts and retains.” It doesn’t always work, of course. The Googles and Facebooks of the world were at least bringing in revenue before they started lavishing their employees with ergonomic perks. Some startups find themselves in the reverse situation, spending big before they’ve hit the jackpot. “It’s not unusual to hear that some company just got a round of financing and bought 20 (Herman Miller) Aeron chairs, or that another just bought 40 at a discount from another startup that went bust,” said Mike Vorhaus, Silicon Valley and technology analyst. “I absolutely think this is a follow-the-leader thing.” Still, many tech firms swear by it, reporting that ergonomic furniture has led to happier, healthier and more productive employees. Outside Los Angeles, underwear subscription startup MeUndies has an office decked out in Herman Miller furniture, with $660 chairs, $1,000 sit-to-stand desks and an open floor plan designed by ergonomists. “The most telling stat is employee retention,” said Terry Lee, MeUndies’ chief operating officer. “In the two years I’ve been here we’ve only had two employees voluntarily leave. In less than a year we’ve doubled our headcount. I think it translates to employee happiness, and workplace ergonomics tie into that.” For most companies, the draw of ergonomics is the effect that it is believed to have on the bottom line. “The companies buying these know if they can get their project done a little sooner, it pays huge dividends,” Voigt said. If a company could squeeze even 10 more minutes of worker efficiency each day, then the cost of an Altwork Station “is completely insignificant,” he said. Voigt is a mechanical engineer by trade and spent most of his career working on aerospace systems. He started on the Altwork Station five years ago when a family friend, who couldn’t sit for long periods of time because of an injury, came to him with the idea of a chair that would let him work in repose. Voigt didn’t think the project would take long. After all, how hard could it be to design a chair? “Well, it’s not just a chair,” he said. “You have to have a desk, and you have to learn about the human body, you have to figure out what to do with devices, and there are all these wonderful problems to solve to get it right.” The Altwork Station is pricier than comparable offerings from Herman Miller and Steelcase, but it’s more adjustable and, according to Voigt, the transitions are more seamless. Users can set their ideal position and the station will remember it. Some of the Valley’s biggest tech companies have already expressed interest in the Altwork Station, although Voigt wouldn’t say which ones. The company, backed by self-funding and $3 million from angel investors, started shipping pre-orders late last month. Although he understands that productivity is probably the desk’s strongest selling point, Voigt insists that the Altwork Station is a solution to neck, shoulder and back contortions we perform every day just to use a computer. “Humans have created all these fantastic things while hunched over a computer,” he said. “The fact that we’ve advanced all this tech but haven’t supported our body in any different way is insane to me.” Share this: Email Print Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Tumblr Telegram Related More articles from Business Amazon looks to clean house – literally App watch: The apps you must download immediately CNET: Which smart bulbs should you use with Alexa?

All rights reserved Terms of use Privacy Sitemap The Intercept_ Unofficial _Sources f t ✉ ⎕ 37 Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Freed From Gag Order, Google Reveals It Received Secret FBI Subpoena Jenna McLaughlin Jenna McLaughlin 2016-10-14T19:57:39+00:00 Photo: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google revealed Wednesday it had been released from an FBI gag order that came with a secret demand for its customers’ personal information. The FBI secret subpoena, known as a national security letter, does not require a court approval. Investigators simply need to clear a low internal bar demonstrating that the information is “relevant to an authorized investigation to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities.” The national security letter issued to Google was mentioned without fanfare in Google’s latest bi-annual transparency report, which includes information on government requests for data the company received from around the world in the first half of 2016. Google received the secret subpoena in first half of 2015, according to the report. An accompanying blog post titled “Building on Surveillance Reform,” also identified new countries that made requests — Algeria, Belarus, and Saudi Arabia among them — and reveals that Google saw an increase in requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Though the Department of Justice and FBI are required by law, following the passage of the USA Freedom Act, to “periodically review” national security letters to determine if a gag order is still necessary — lifting it either once an investigation has concluded or three years after it’s been put in place — only a handful of the hundreds of thousands of letters issued each year have been revealed. That Google can now speak freely about the 2015 national security letter is a result of those changes. Government watchdogs have criticized the FBI for abusing national security letters multiple times over the years — for restricting First Amendment protected speech, failing to provide enough evidence to make the requests, and targeting a massive number of Americans without notifying them or giving them the chance for redress. The provisions in the Freedom Act were meant to address some concerns — including what many have argued are unconstitutionally lengthy gag orders. But Google in its short blog post did not publish the contents of the actual letter the way other companies, including Yahoo, have done in recent months. Asked about plans to release the national security letter, a Google spokesperson told The Intercept it will release it, though it wouldn’t say when or in what form it will do so. Google hasn’t previously published any national security letters, though it’s possible gag orders for prior demands are still in place. It’s also unclear why Google wouldn’t immediately publish the document — unless the gag is only partially lifted, or the company is involved in ongoing litigation to challenge the order, neither of which were cited as reasons for holding it back “I think the question is really a great and important one for Google,” Brett Max Kaufman, a national security staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in an email to The Intercept. Kaufman recently worked with Open Whisper Systems, the creators of end-to-end encrypted messaging application Signal, to successfully challenge a gag order on a criminal subpoena — though the company had almost no information to turn over, based on the way the application is designed. “If the gag is really gone in its entirety — maybe it’s not — it’s hard to imagine why they couldn’t publish a redacted version of it that would still protect the target’s privacy,” Kaufman continued. “From here it seems like a policy choice not to release it, and a strange one at that.” Contact the author: Jenna McLaughlin✉jenna.mclaughlin@​theintercept.comt@JennaMC_Laugh ˅ ⎕ 37 Comments (closed) The Intercept_ Newsletter D × ✓ Weekly Digest ✓ Breaking Stories and Exclusives ⟶ Email list managed by MailChimp Filters SVG

Spending your PPC budget on another channel. Ignoring cross-domain tracking in Google Analytics. I like to consider myself a dreamer, but when it comes to increasing search traffic into conversions, I tend to ignore the statements above. This is especially true to Pubcon speakers like Gary Illyes, Bill Hunt, Annie Cushing, and Jenny Halasz, pushing those search marketing goals into the “must-haves” category. Day 3 of my Pubcon adventures as a newbie presented the secrets to the future of search, optimizing on Amazon, and tracking valuable reports in Google Analytics. Here’s what you need to know from Pubcon today: “Women in Digital Marketing” Breakfast After an exciting night at the US Search Awards with notable winners (congrats Go Fish Digital and Eric Enge!), I started the morning with a “Women in Digital” breakfast. Kelsey Jones, Executive Editor at SEJ, CEO of MoxieDot and StoryShout, graciously invited me to attend this power woman’s breakfast. I was humbled, honored, and heartened to share a table with some of the best minds in search that I’ve been looking up to throughout my career. Some of the attendees included: Katy Katz Annie Cushing Jenny Halasz Kelcey Piper Robyn Johnson Kendall Bird Susan Wenograd Jenise Uehara Henrikson Jessica Cromwell Danielle Antosz I look forward to many more of these “Women in Digital” breakfast power sessions. If you more on women in tech from Pubcon, check out Kelsey’s article. Keynote Speakers Gary Illyes & Bill Hunt The morning kicked off with Gary Illyes, Webmaster Trends Analyst for Google, shares tremendous insights into the inner workings of Google’s search algorithm. Here are a few of the big takeaways: Ranking without links is tough. Penguin 4.0 will devalue “all links” going to a site if it sees signs of link manipulation. Rankbrain was live months before it launched. Everyone should switch to HTTPS. Google is changing to a mobile first index. The new change is set to go live on January 10, 2017. The team at Overit offered another doodle of Gary: "Links are more scarce on the mobile web" says @methode via @2theTopDesign #Pubcon #SketchPubcon pic.twitter.com/rYEKsaHXST — Overit (@overit) October 13, 2016 Next, Bill Hunt, President of Back Azimuth Consulting, presented the on the current state and future of SEM/SEO in 2016. Hunt has worked with global brands such as Cisco, Absolut Vodka, IBM, P&G, and much more. Let’s take a look at the big takeaways from Bill’s keynote: PPC is the best marketing tactic, but we aren’t doing it well. SEO is not magic. Focus on on-page and link quality. You need to check out his DataPrizm keyword research tool. Utilize site search data with organic SEO. Google AMP is showing up for non-news page sites. Session 1: Optimizing for Amazon I had the pleasure of getting to know Robyn Johnson at the “Women in Digital” breakfast. Her story of starting with $100 and turning it into a seven-figure eCommerce business is inspiring and powerful. If you know anything about selling products online, you know it doesn’t get any bigger than Amazon.  And so, Robyn Johnson, Amazon consultant and the host of The Unstoppable Entrepreneur Show, shared some of the greatest tips to optimizing your Amazon products for SEO. So, what is the secret sauce to beating the Amazon algorithm? The future of Amazon is 100% Prime. Use flat files to get your changes approved faster. The most important rule of Amazon’s 14 is customer obsession. If you want A+ listing videos, contact Cascadia Seller Solutions.  If you’re a brand owner on Amazon, listen to this podcast with Robyn and James Thompson.  If you’re using Sponsored Ads and Amazon determines you are not relevant, your ads will never be seen. Session 2: Google Analytics Customization It might be time for Google Analytics to change their name to Google Annielytics. While I admit, I am a major fan girl for Annie Cushing, founder of Annielytics, and Jenny Halasz, search marketing consultant at JLH Marketing, Inc., data is still the main event for me when developing my SEO strategy. So, you can imagine how pumped I was to have it all packed into one 1-hour session. Let’s review some of the key tips from Jenny: Jenny recommends putting together 3 dashboards for every Google Analytics account to answer these questions: How did people get there? What did they do while they were there? And, why did they leave? If you don’t know what regular expressions (regex) are, read Jenny’s guide here.  Data is just data. Analysis leads to insight. Check out Jenny’s full presentation here: Advanced Google Analytics – Jenny Halasz from Jenny Halasz Now, let’s head over to Annie’s tips for Google Analytics: Do not use Google Analytics for social media reporting. They are terrible. The “Other” bucket in your channels report under Acquisition is incredibly valuable. Create new channels to track with campaign tagging. (Example: Retargeter should be a medium). When using mediums, never choose “exact match.” Set-up smart filters. Set-up cross-domain tracking to help track PayPal. If you want more from Annie, check out her slides here.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Telstra Australia starts delivering pre-order Pixel phones By R Padla - October 14, 2016 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Australians will soon receive the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones as Telstra Australia began to take pre-orders. Actually, one lucky customer already received his Pixel early this week and gladly showed it off over on Reddit. A certain ‘wooparse’ posted a photo of his Pixel phone and was game enough to answer questions from netizens. He was happy with the Pixel’s early arrival in the country but saw the challenge of having no protective phone case to buy. This redditor was one of the first batch to receive a Google-branded phone so he doesn’t know much about the unit. He asked how to activate the full photo resolution storage for future use and shared whatever he sees on the Pixel. So far, the new Pixel owner shared there’s an ambient display when a new notification is available or receive. The new Google Assistant starts when you say “Ok Google”. Buttons and navigations are smooth. Boot animation shows colored balls jumping over each other. The phone doesn’t seem to feature any carrier bloatware. When it comes to imaging, the Pixel camera can perform a 0.6-second long exposure with the shutter and FV5. Phone comes with standard earphones and some pre-installed apps. He also noted that encryption is turned on by default. The Pixel also features a magnetic back plus features Maps and Compass that are said to be accurate especially since it uses Google Maps.

As Samsung scrambles to determine what caused its Note 7 smartphones to overheat and catch fire, Google, Apple, and other manufacturers are poised to benefit from the carrier's misstep. A new survey from e-commerce firm Branding Brand found that 40 percent of people who currently own a Samsung device say they won't buy another phone from the Korean electronics giant. The majority, 62 percent, plan to go with another Android phone for their next purchase, while 30 percent say they plan to switch to the iPhone and 8 percent could buy a Google Pixel. While Apple's iPhone has always been a close competitor to Samsung's flagship smartphones, the Google Pixel is a newcomer to the high-end mobile market. Announced on Oct. 4, it will be the first device to feature Google's new voice-activated personal digital Assistant, similar to Apple's Siri or Amazon's Alexa. The phone also boasts other software improvements unavailable to any other Android device currently on the market, and Google says its camera outperforms all the smartphone shooters it's tested. //Related Articles How to Return or Exchange Your Samsung Galaxy Note 7 That 8 percent of Samsung owners are considering switching to a competing flagship device that is not even on the market yet speaks as much to the buzz that the Google Pixel has generated as the crisis that faces Samsung. On Tuesday, the company said it was killing production of the Note 7, and asked retailers not to sell their remaining inventory. According to the New York Times, Samsung in September assigned hundreds of employees to test Note 7s in hopes of determining what is causing them to explode, but none were able to replicate the problem. Samsung has since remained quiet on the progress of its efforts to determine the cause. The company has received 92 reports of the batteries overheating in the US, including 26 reports of burns and 55 reports of property damage, according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission.

Yesterday, Google published Daydream Keyboard on the Play Store showing the “on-screen virtual reality keyboard for text entry in Daydream applications.” The keyboard itself is visually very similar to the Google Keyboard with a grey theme and blue highlights that match the Pixel’s custom accents. Unsurprisingly, it shares the exact same Android icons and it’s unknown whether you can change the theme in settings Instead of tapping shift to access the numeral rows, a dedicated keypad floats to the left side of the keyboard. To the right is panel with a giant delete button, enter key, and button for switching inputs. The Play Store screenshot show a search box floating above the keyboard and a virtual desktop similar to the Daydream UI. Google notes that “Some Daydream apps will not work if you uninstall Daydream Keyboard” and that Daydream Keyboard is only compatible with Daydream-ready phones.” Interestingly, Android Police says that the app can be installed on the Nexus 6P, which means it most likely also works on Pixel and Pixel XL, which are actually Daydream-ready. You can grab the app on the Play Store. Guides Daydream View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

How does the hotly anticipated Pixel compare to its industry-leading Android competitor, the Samsung Galaxy S7? Size The two phones have the same width, but the Pixel is just a touch taller and thinner. Weight The comparatively squat Galaxy S7 is 6-percent heavier than the Pixel. Build When it comes to build, Google sticks with an iPhone-esque aluminum unibody, while Samsung keeps things interesting with slick curvy glass. The minimal aluminum frame nearly disappears into the glass front and back, which earned it major points in our review. Water resistance The Galaxy 7 series has industry-leading water resistance. The IP68 rating means the S7 can withstand immersion in up to five feet of water for up to 30 minutes. Unfortunately, the first Google-branded phone offers no such reassurance. Colors There are three color variants for each model; both are available in black and silver. In addition, Pixel takes a more colorful route with a blue option, while S7 goes for the gold. Display size Even though the S7 is smaller, Samsung manages to sneak a little extra screen (2 percent more) onto its front surface area. Display resolution The Pixel's 1,920 x 1,080 display meets the Full HD standard, but its resolution is still dwarfed next to the S7's Quad HD display. The difference might seem like overkill, but we bet that it makes a quite a difference when using mobile VR headsets. Display type Both manufacturers fall on the same side of the fence when it comes to using IPS vs. AMOLED display technology. Curved display The Pixel has a standard rectangular screen. The Galaxy S7's display hugs the curves of its glass front, curling ever so slightly around the edges of the phone. Always-on display We'll be able to confirm this once we perform our full-length review of the Pixel, but for now, it does not seem to have an "always-on" display option like the S7 does. This feature lets you see key notifications at a glance, without having to unlock the phone. Pressure-sensitive display Apple has developed a pressure-sensitive display that lets you lightly tap or firmly press the touchscreen for different results, but similar capabilities have yet to come to Android devices. Neither of these phones have a pressure-sensitive display. Camera megapixels The two devices have matching rear camera resolution, but with a notable 3-megapixel advantage, the Pixel is the selfie champ. Camera aperture (rear) The smaller the f-stop, the larger the aperture. A larger aperture means sharper photos in low light, among other things. S7 beats Pixel in this department. Optical image stabilization Optical image stabilization is absent from the Pixel. That means you'll see less noticeable camera shake and consequential photo blur from the OIS-equipped S7. Dual-lens camera Unlike the iPhone 7 Plus or the Huawei Honor 8, there are no fancy dual-lens tricks here. Charging/data port Pixel uses a more universal USB-C charging/data port, while the S7 uses the smaller microUSB. Battery Both phones have fairly large batteries, but the S7 edges out the Pixel. According to Google, a full Pixel charge will get you up to 26 hours of talk time and up to 13 hours of internet use or video playback over Wi-Fi. By Samsung's count, the S7 is good for up to 28 hours of talk time, 13 hours of internet use, or 16 hours of video playback. Fast charging Both phones offer the convenience of a quick charge. Wireless charging The S7 can be charged wirelessly using a charge pad (sold separately), but not the Pixel. Processor The two processors have the same clock speeds, but the Pixel's is a slightly newer version. RAM These phones have matching amounts of memory. Internal storage Both phones have 32 and 128-gigabyte storage sizes. The S7 also offers an intermediate 64-gigabyte option. microSD No matter which size S7 you get, rest assured knowing you'll never run out of space thanks to the phone's microSD expandable storage. VR headset compatibility Google's Pixel phones and Samsung's Galaxy 7 series are the leading virtual reality-ready phones on the market. Pixel is Daydream View-compatible; Gear VR is Samsung's offering. Headphone jack Be relieved, owners of expensive headphones: Android manufacturers haven't axed the headphone jack yet. Fingerprint sensor Fingerprint sensors are practically non-negotiable smartphone features at this point. Google puts its sensor on the back of the Pixel; Samsung's is incorporated into the home button. Mobile payments Both phones are equipped for mobile payments. Samsung Pay is supported in more countries, and it's accepted by more merchants within those countries. Why? Samsung Pay can actually mimic the swiping of a magnetic strip in addition to NFC transactions, so merchants shouldn't need any newfangled equipment to accept it. Virtual assistant Google Assistant (the newest iteration of Google Now) makes its first appearance on the Pixel and Pixel XL. We have not yet tried out this voice-activated virtual assistant for ourselves, but it is shaping up to be a more powerful alternative to the Google Now/S Voice features on the Galaxy S7. Operating system As Google's first real flagship, Pixel will launch running the absolute latest version of its operating system, Android 7.1 Nougat. Google has said Pixel will be on the forefront of new updates for the next two years and will receive security updates for three years. As of now, the Galaxy S7 is running Android Marshmallow with Samsung's proprietary TouchWiz skin. In the past, Samsung has taken 5-6 months to roll out its customized updates, which would place the Nougat update sometime in the beginning of 2017. Release The recently launched Pixel is the newcomer to the market. The S7 was released earlier this year. Starting price (full retail) Samsung prices vary depending on carrier and payment plan, but you'll likely pay about US$20 more for a Galaxy S7 over Google's Pixel. However, the Samsung flagship's specs sneak past Google's in a number of areas. The extra cash could be well worth it, particularly if you're drawn to its glass build, water resistance, expandable storage, or the versatility of Samsung Pay. Still, as the first "made by Google" phone, Pixel could offer a cohesive software and hardware experience not seen in other Android phones. We're also excited to see how the Daydream View experience compares to that of the Gear VR. We'll post a full length review of the Pixel once the phones ship. Until then, read up on what the Galaxy S7 has to offer, or check out News Atlas' comparisons of the Pixel and iPhone 7, or the Pixel XL and iPhone 7 Plus.

However, today the firm's chief executive Marc Benioff told the FT a deal was off - and shares slid 6 percent.  Twitter has yet to post a profit even after ramping up advertising efforts. Salesforce chief executive today Marc Benioff told the FT a deal was off as it 'wasn't a right fit'. Last week it emerged Google and Walt Disney had decided not to pursue a deal. 'In this case we've walked away. It wasn't the right fit for us,' he said in an interview with the FT. According to the paper's sources, Twitter's advisers are still seeking other potential bidders, but a person close to Twitter's senior management said 'the sale process is virtually dead.'

Share this article Share 21 shares Twitter had told potential acquirers it is seeking to conclude negotiations about selling itself by the time it reports third-quarter earnings on Oct. 27, according to people familiar with the matter. 'It's not the right fit for us for many different reasons,' Mr Benioff said, when asked if price was the deciding factor, adding: 'You're going to look at price, you're going to look at culture, you're going to look at everything.' TWITTER'S PLUNGING SHARE PRICE  Shares of Twitter's stock plunged to their lowest level since August on the news, falling as much as 8 percent and last seen down about 5.5 percent.  Salesforce shares were up 5.5 percent. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. Last week it was thought Google parent Alphabet was a likely contender for the microblogging service but those familiar with the deal told Recode that the company was not moving forward with an effort to buy Twitter at this time. Disney had also considered making a bid but is not currently planning an offer, according to sources.   Twitter shares plunged on the latest news. Twitter has struggled to generate revenue growth and profit, despite having some 313 million average monthly active users and a growing presence as a source of news. The company missed Wall Street's sales expectations in both the first and second quarters of 2016, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, and has yet to produce a net profit in 11 quarters as a public company. It has also failed to keep pace with rivals, notably Facebook Inc's Instagram and Snapchat.  Both now boast more users than Twitter by most measures, even though they are much newer, and advertisers have begun to migrate their ad dollars accordingly. Dorsey, who returned to Twitter as chief executive more than a year ago, has been part of Disney's board since 2013. Twitter went public in November 2013 at $26 a share.  The shares peaked above $74 just over a month after its IPO, but have been on steady downward trajectory since. Read more: www.ft.com/conte...

Rahul Kanwal  | Posted by Bijaya Kumar Das  Follow @rahulkanwal   rahul.kanwal@aajtak.com New Delhi, October 15, 2016 | UPDATED 13:32 IST A +A - PTI photo: Arvind Kejriwal. Highlights 1 Delhi govt spent Rs 1.58 crore to advertise on Facebook, YouTube and Google. 2 AAP's social-media ads were aimed at Goa, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. 3 The contract for the campaign was handed out to PR firm Perfect Relations without open bidding. A probe report submitted to the office of Delhi Lieutenant Governor Najeeb Jung has found that the AAP government misused taxpayers' money to expand the party's political base outside the city and separately nailed "nepotism" under Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's watch. According to documents accessed by India Today TV, the Delhi government spent Rs 1.58 crore to advertise on Facebook, YouTube and Google. What raises questions about this publicity campaign is the target audience. Official documents show the AAP's social-media advertisements were aimed at Goa, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, where the party hopes to expand its political footprint. "Talk to AK", for example, is a web-based interactive programme launched by AAP purportedly to extend an opportunity to residents to question their CM. LG'S PROBE REPORT SAYS ANOTHER STORY But the LG's probe report has found that the project catered to audiences in other states. The Arvind Kejriwal-led government has been jostling with the Centre for control on land, police and administrative powers over the bureaucracy that is currently in the hands of the L-G who reports to the union home ministry. The Delhi High Court said in August that the lieutenant governor is the administrative head of the Capital and the state government must consult him on all decisions. The Aam Aadmi Party government challenged this decision in the Supreme Court, which will hear the final arguments on November 15. Following the HC ruling in his favour, Jung formed the three-member panel to scan files to check "irregularities" and "infirmities" in Delhi government decisions over the past 18 months. "There is no justification on file as to why the (advertisement) programme is being done. No public purpose seems to be served to the citizens of Delhi as the target audience is from other states, i.e Punjab, Gujarat, Goa where elections are scheduled in early 2017," the probe report notes. A breakdown of the spending showed Rs 60 lakh was earmarked for Facebook to reach 1.8 crore voting-age people in Delhi, Goa, Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat. Another Rs 25 lakh was set aside for YouTube for a pan-India audience of around 20 lakh. According to official papers, Rs 20 lakh each were budgeted for the Google Display Network and Facebook post-event plans. CONTRACT HANDED OUT TO PR FIRM WITHOUT BIDDING The probe report has discovered the contract for the campaign was handed out to a PR firm, Perfect Relations, without any open bidding. When contacted, the management of Perfect Relations said they had carried out the mandate that they had been given by the Delhi government and would not like to comment on the draft probe report. India Today TV has learnt that a private complaint has also been filed with the Central Bureau of Investigation, which is expected to begin a preliminary inquiry soon. APPOINTMENT OF DR NIKUNJ AGGARWAL AS OSD UNDER SCANNER Separately, Jung's office is also probing the curious appointment of Dr Nikunj Aggarwal as officer on special duty to Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain. Dr Aggarwal is the son-in-law of the sister-in-law of CM Kejriwal. He was first appointed as a senior resident doctor for orthopaedics. What makes the appointment, at the Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalaya, suspicious is that it came at a time when no such post was vacant in the institute. "Posts are filled through advertising, but in the instant case, the appointment was done without any advertisement," notes the draft probe report of the three-member Shunglu committee. A vacant position of faculty in the orthopaedics department was adjusted to make way for the entry of Kejriwal's relative, it states. Also, the appointment of Dr Aggarwal was done on the basis of a simple hand-written application, without government norms being followed, according to the report. Within three months, Dr Nikunj Aggarwal was then appointed as the OSD to health minister Jain. What has raised the hackles of the probe team was a state-sponsored programme for Dr Aggarwal at a top institute. According to official documents, he was sent, on government expense of Rs 1.15 lakh, to a management-development programme for senior healthcare officials at IIM, Ahmedabad. "Being a senior resident (ad hoc), Dr Aggarwal was not entitled to participate in such types of trainings at government expense as per residency scheme of the hospital," says the probe report. It has also found discrepancies in an order dated July 2016 of the department of health and family welfare, which approved government expenses for his trip to Beijing to attend the China Sinopharm International Corporation. "Being an ad hoc employee, the cost of to-and-fro tickets to Beijing, visa charges and TA/DA borne by the Department of Health and Family Welfare is a clear cut case of financial impropriety. His travel to China was not in public interest as he is not a government employee. His appointment is illegal as it has been done in violation of laid-down norms. This is a clear cut case of favouritism and nepotism as Dr Nikunj Aggarwal is a close relative of the chief minister," the report observed.

(Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) Blades, Dell, Google, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel Google, IBM, Others Pitch Open Standard for Cloud Server Design by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on October 14, 2016 Add Your Comments Tweet A group of tech giants working to mount a serious challenge to Intel in the data center, has previewed an upcoming open standard for interconnecting components in a server it is positioning as an alternative to Intel’s proprietary technology. The group includes Google, hardware vendors IBM, HP Enterprise, Dell EMC, as well as Intel’s more direct rivals AMD and NVIDIA, among others. IBM’s upcoming Power9 processors, expected to launch next year, will support the standard and so will IBM’s servers they will power. Intel currently dominates the market for server chips, and hyperscale data center operators like Google, which spend enormous amounts of money on hardware every quarter, want a viable alternative. They have generally adopted a multi-vendor strategy for sourcing nearly all components of their infrastructure, but it’s difficult to extend that strategy to processors given the size of Intel’s lead in the market. OpenCAPI and Power9 are aimed at the high end of the server market – computers used for data-intensive analytics workloads or machine learning. The group claims that the standard will be capable of boosting server performance tenfold. That performance improvement comes as a result of two things: higher bandwidth on the links between CPUs and accelerators and cache coherency, which essentially means data needs to be shuffled less within the system as it is being processed, saving resources as a result. Click chart to enlarge: Accelerators, or additional processors that take on a portion of the CPU’s workload to free up its resources, have been a mainstay in the world of supercomputers for years, but their role is now growing in importance in server architecture for cloud data centers and for the quickly emerging field of machine learning. “The compute model going forward is the marriage between a really good data-centric processor, like Power, and a really good set of acceleration technologies,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power Systems, said in an interview with Data Center Knowledge. Most accelerators in use today are GPUs, made by the likes of AMD and Nvidia, and some are Intel’s Xeon Phi, but there has also been growth in the use of FPGAs, or Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, as accelerators. The advantage of FPGAs is that they can be reconfigured as workload needs change. Intel has invested heavily in FPGAs last year, paying $16.7 billion to acquire FPGA specialist Altera. The most prominent user of FPGAs to accelerate cloud workloads is Microsoft, whose latest-generation cloud server design supports the technology. See also: AMD Reaches Deal With Alibaba to Use Chips in Cloud Service It’s unclear at this point what kind of architecture will dominate the market for machine-learning hardware. There are divergent views on this today, with companies like Nvidia supporting GPU-accelerated AI servers and Intel saying that model isn’t scalable, pitching the next generation of its Xeon Phi processors – codenamed Knights Mill and expected to hit the market next year – as the better alternative. Amazon’s cloud servers for data-intensive workloads, including machine learning, rely on GPUs, and so does Big Sur, Facebook’s open source server design for AI workloads. See also: Why NVIDIA Gifted Elon Musk’s AI Non-Profit Its Latest Supercomputer Google has designed its own custom chip for machine learning, called Tensor Processing Unit. The company hasn’t revealed any details about TPU’s architecture, saying only that it is an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and that it is optimized for TensorFlow, its library of open source software for making AI applications. Google is also working on a server design together with Rackspace, which will run on IBM’s Power9 processors and have the OpenCAPI interface. The companies released the first draft of the Zaius server spec, which they plan to contribute to the Open Compute Project, today. The OpenCAPI consortium has an FPGA player among its members, in addition to server and GPU vendors. San Jose-based Xilinx plans to support OpenCAPI-enabled FPGAs, according to Friday’s announcement. IBM’s accelerator strategy has been to support as broad an array of choices as possible. Its current-generation Power8 chip supports NVIDIA’s GPU interconnect technology NVLink, and so will Power9, Balog said.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better. David’s feature story about Fitbit’s quest to get more people wearing Fitbits. David again on smartwatches and fitness trackers. Recommendations this week: Authy and the Garmin Forerunner 735XT.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants. David’s recommendation this week is Poisonfeather by Matthew Fitzsimmons. Michael recommends Amanda yerba mate.

For now, some of us still need powerful PCs. This week, we got to see that Microsoft and Apple are still intent on wowing our socks off when it comes to hardware for developers and creative professionals. With the new Surface Studio from Microsoft and the redesigned MacBook Pro from Apple, we’ve got some great options. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Surface Studio looks hot. So does the new MacBook Pro with the Touch Bar. Also see David’s hands-on report. Margaret Rhodes has some additional thoughts on the Touch Bar as well. There’s also a new Surface Book from Microsoft. David’s recommendation this week is Lessons From the Screenplay. Michael’s is the Jaybird X3 sweat-proof wireless earphones.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right. What about a Snapchat story, or a local city council meeting on Twitter? Yes—why not. The hosts discuss these changes in light of YouTube’s new app, Twitter’s new strategy, Snap’s new hardware, and Roku’s new future-proofed players.

Even though it makes less sense, Google will still probably pull the trigger. Evan Niu (TMFNewCow) Oct 14, 2016 at 1:42PM Android Wear smartwatches. Image source: Google. Google's new Pixel phones represent an important strategic shift for the company. It's the first time that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google has designed phones from the ground up, in contrast with prior Nexus devices where Google merely collaborated with hardware original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). The timing is a bit peculiar considering the ongoing maturation of the global smartphone market, combined with the fact that phones are so good nowadays that there's not a whole lot of potential hardware innovation left. But now that Google has embarked upon this path, we have to wonder what other products the company may have in the pipeline. Over the summer, Android Police reported that Google was working on a pair of Android Wear smartwatches, that would feature deep integration of Google Assistant, the revamped virtual assistant and spiritual successor of Google Now. The site subsequently snagged some renderings of what the pair of smartwatches might look like, which Android Police says are code-named Angelfish and Swordfish. Image source: Android Police. While these rumors remain unconfirmed, with no indications at Google's recent product event that it had such devices in the works, investors should consider if it makes sense for Google to design smartwatches, since the company is clearly making big moves into hardware. Why the smartwatch category is different Intuitively, you might think that of course Google would make a smartwatch since it has expressed a clear ambition to take greater control of the hardware that delivers its software. The search giant now makes phones, virtual reality headset accessories, Wi-Fi routers, speakers powered by virtual assistants, and more. Smartwatches are the newest computing product category, so it stands to reason that Google would jump in there, too. It does make more sense to enter into a nascent market, since there is greater opportunity to have an impact. However, there's a huge difference between Android and Android Wear: OEM customization. On smartphones, Google allowed OEMs to make all sorts of modifications and user interface (UI) customizations, which OEMs took full advantage of in an effort to differentiate themselves. They also added a wide range of additional software features, for better or for worse. But this created layers of fragmentation within the platform, and things got out of hand -- fast. In response, Google launched its Nexus program as a way to offer stock Android, while setting an example of what a flagship Android phone should be. Pixel is just an evolution of that same strategic purpose. But Google decidedly does not allow OEMs to add UI customizations to Android Wear, implicitly acknowledging that OEMs went overboard, potentially to the detriment of the operating system. OEMs aren't particularly happy with this decision; Huawei publicly called on Google to open up Android Wear to customizations last year. But this position makes sense from Google's perspective, since standardization can translate into a more consistent and potentially better user experience. If there's more standardization within the platform, there's less need for Google to take matters into its own hands if OEMs are merely being relegated to what they're good at: hardware. Still probably happening While there may be less strategic value relative to smartphones to design its own hardware, I still think Google will likely pull the trigger here. Smartwatches are too important of a product category for Google to leave to the OEMs alone. Indeed, industry leaker Evan Blass says Google's pair of smartwatches will be released in Q1 2017. Presumably, they'll bear the Pixel branding. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Evan Niu, CFA has no position in any stocks mentioned.

WonderHowTo.com reached out to Google to ask whether or not Pixel devices would feature unlockable bootloaders and the short answer is yes. Iska Saric confirmed that customers who purchased their Pixel device from the Google Store will be able to root their devices, thanks to shipping with an unlockable bootloader. Sadly, it was confirmed earlier that phones purchased directly from carrier partner Verizon will not feature unlockable bootloaders. If rooting is an important feature for you, you’ll want to purchase from the Google Store.

It starts with the ability to search for “who’s on my ballot” in the main Google search engine. Users who do so will be asked to provide the street address where they’ll be voting (i.e. it will be added to Google’s profile on you if that was somehow missing). Google Maps users will be prompted to use their Home address. You’ll then be given all the candidates on your ballot, as well as quick access to information on how to vote in your state and where to vote in your district. In my opinion Google is performing a huge service to the country with this feature. Watch the video for more information. Share this: Facebook Twitter Google LinkedIn Reddit 2 Comments Add a comment Jamie October 14, 2016 Sorry to be an Eeyore, but it *would* be great if they weren’t simultaneously collecting information. I could take anything Google puts on offer a lot more seriously if anything they did included the explicit assurance that no personal information would be logged, saved, or passed on, particularly for private matters such as this. :/ Again, sorry, but I just don’t trust ’em. October 14, 2016 at 3:13 EST PM Macfox October 15, 2016 So right, Jamie. You really can’t trust places like Google, Facebook, etc. ALL your personal info is up for grabs.

Context, Language, and Reasoning in AI: Three Key Challenges The next phase in the AI revolution calls for advances in how the technology addresses and processes data from the non-vision world. by Venkat Srinivasan, CEO, RAGE Frameworks October 14, 2016 Provided by Today, artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly emerging out of R&D labs and into the mainstream. Smart technologies are changing every aspect of our lives, from the way we work, to health care, education, travel, and transportation. One example: the self-driving cars produced by Google and Tesla. There are also many successful applications in the computer vision space. But what about the non-vision applications of AI: that is, areas including non-spatial data—most importantly, text and numbers? The IBM Watson technology platform has famously beaten human chess grandmasters and a “Jeopardy” champion and is featured with celebrities in TV ads heralding the arrival of a smarter planet. Google’s AlphaGo recently beat a Korean grandmaster in an even more complex challenge, the ancient game of Go. Does all that mean AI is finally here for non-vision applications? We believe the answer is an emphatic “yes”—but not with the current approaches used by IBM and Google.  Because of AI’s revolutionary potential, its applications in non-vision problems have attracted tremendous interest. There have also been attempts to replicate what worked with spatial data and apply it to text (and numbers). I’m referring to what seems like a blind rush of computational, statistically based approaches to process natural language. Such approaches attempt to turn text into data and then look for deep patterns in that data. That situation reminds me of when physicists entered the financial market space and attempted to create predictive models for financial data. Such efforts are bound to fail, as has already happened to several companies. Eventually, the hype and illusion of applicability will wear off. Then we’ll address the problem by focusing on the fundamental characteristics of the data and devising an approach that is more conceptually sound.­ Addressing a Trio of Challenges AI technologies must overcome three challenges to be successful in the non-vision world (and perhaps even in the vision world): language, context, and reasoning. A recent MIT Technology Review article, “AI’s Language Problem,” eloquently points out the first challenge. Today’s AI technologies, including those IBM Watson and Google AlphaGo, struggle to process language the way that humans do. That’s because the large majority of the current implementations approach text as data, not as language. They apply the same techniques that worked on spatial data to text. The second challenge—understanding context—is related to the language problem, but is sufficiently significant that I think of it as an independent issue. Natural language text needs to be processed in the right context. The right context can only be developed if the technology focuses on the language structure, not just on the words in the text, as most current technologies seem to be doing, according to a 2014 article in IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine. Then there’s the third challenge: the traceability of reasoning that the solution deploys to reach its conclusion. Various technologies are attempting to address all three challenges today. Several successful enterprise AI solutions deal with language, context, and reasoning transparency effectively. Handling Natural Language: From Processing to Understanding Current methods for natural language processing (NLP) are largely driven by computational statistics. These methods don’t attempt to understand the text, but instead convert the text into data, then attempt to learn from patterns in that data. In the conversion process, we lose all context and meaning in the text. The assumption behind such approaches is clearly that, given sufficiently large collections of text, all possible permutations and combinations of meaning must be present. Thus, discovering word-based patterns should reveal the intelligence in the text, which can then be acted upon. Unfortunately, that outcome doesn’t occur in most real-world situations. To address the language challenge in AI, we have to move from mechanically converting natural language to data through, for example, word occurrence-based logic. We can then understand the language by using its linguistic structure and the principles we have learned to express our thoughts. I view this as moving from NLP to Natural Language Understanding (NLU). In my view, NLP has come to symbolize the mechanical approach to natural language through conversion of text into data. Our real goal in AI is devising mechanisms for understanding the meaning of the written text. A deep understanding of the linguistics structure in text would involve applying several principles from computational linguistics to decompose the text back into the concepts and verbiage used to connect them in the text. This is essentially reverse-engineering the text back to its fundamental ideas to understand how those ideas were connected together to form sentences and paragraphs. RAGE AI has demonstrated such deep linguistic learning, and RAGE Frameworks has used this method to create and successfully deploy several AI applications in global corporations. Understanding Context NLU also involves understanding the context in which the language is used. But understanding context involves multiple challenges.   First, in many languages, certain words can be used in multiple senses. That makes it important to eliminate the ambiguity of all such words so that their usage in a particular document can be accurately understood. Word-sense disambiguation is an ongoing issue in linguistics, but researchers have made significant progress toward addressing it. Second, text documents often use domain-specific discourse models such as legal contracts, news articles, research reports, and the like. Certain properties of such domain discourse models should be incorporated into the AI technology to enhance NLU. Third, we use many words as proxies in the document for other concepts. For example, most commonly, we say “Xerox” for “copy,” “FedEx” for “overnight courier,” and so on.  AI technology must be able to recognize and understand these proxies. Finally, the document may refer to knowledge that isn’t explicitly included of the text. We can understand it only if we have that prior knowledge. AI has to create a repository of such global knowledge that can be retrieved, in context, to supplement the text in the document to gain full understanding of the meaning of the text. The Automated Knowledge Discoverer in RAGE AI is one such example of this idea, as I explain in more depth in my recent book, The Intelligent Enterprise in the Era of Big Data (John Wiley & Sons, 2016). This technology can automatically discover ideas related to a notion and expressions with various rhetorical relationships to the concept of interest. For a period of time, such knowledge and global context may have to be refined by human experts. But in a short period, we have found it possible to create enough knowledge in the machine for it to perform at better than 90 percent recall. For instance, we created an AI application to categorize relevant content for a global consulting company across 20 of its practice areas. The idea was to provide, on a real-time basis, distilled knowledge to all of its consultants, using information gleaned from each practice area. Automated knowledge discovery was used to expand this to a more global understanding. Now, this application categorizes 40 million articles a month with greater than 90 percent accuracy through deep linguistic learning. Reasoning The final challenge we need to recognize is the visibility to the reasoning deployed by AI technology. Almost all AI technologies using computational statistics are black boxes. There’s nothing wrong with that per se—except that when we get a recommendation from the AI technology and it isn’t intuitive, we have no way of understanding it. We also don’t know if it is truly causal or spurious. We just have to blindly trust it. Of course, there are applications where such visibility may not matter. For instance, in the example involving the game Go, it wasn’t important to understand the reasoning deployed by the machine for its moves. Another example: While we’d all prefer for Internet searches to be more relevant, the false positives don’t bother us too much. On the other hand, we believe that for many applications, such visibility will be essential for adoption. In certain mission-critical applications where people are held accountable—such as medicine and business—users have to develop trust that the engine’s reasoning is sound. Visibility would also make it easier to improve the engine in the event of  false positives or false negatives. With a black box, we have to find enough instances of false positives or false negatives to rebuild the black box. We’ll have no way of knowing whether all variations or permutations of that error have been addressed. The good news: With the adoption of deep linguistic learning, we can maintain full and complete visibility to the reasoning.  Venkat Srinivasan is the founding CEO of RAGE Frameworks and a successful serial entrepreneur.

While pundits are in disagreement about the role the media should play in vetting politicians' statements, readers are bringing record traffic to fact-checking websites like Politifact. By Ellen Powell, Staff October 14, 2016 Save for later Saved Google's headquarters is seen in Mountain View, Calif., on Jan. 3, 2013. The search engine will begin flagging articles with a new 'Fact check' tag on Google News, the company announced Thursday. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP/File View Caption About video ads View Caption of Perhaps inspired by the "fact check" election, Google News is introducing a new label for stories that rigorously vet politicians' statements. Google, whose News feature aggregates content from news sites around the world, already labels some types of articles, such as “In-Depth” and “Opinion” pieces. Earlier in the year, it added a “Local Source” tag to feature local coverage of major news events. Now, the website and app have a new category – “Fact Check” – that highlights stories assessing the veracity of statements by public figures. The new category may be a response to the 2016 US presidential election, which has been heavy on fact-checking. Though some don't see the value in media fact-checking, the wild ride of the campaign appears to have bolstered many readers’ interest. Recommended:Are you smarter than a Fox News viewer? How about a CNN viewer? Take our quiz to find out. “Our traffic is better than it’s ever been,” Angie Drobnic Holan, editor in chief of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact.com, told The Christian Science Monitor in July. “Media organizations are doing fact-checking in part because it’s very popular with readers.” Test your knowledgeAre you smarter than a Fox News viewer? How about a CNN viewer? Take our quiz to find out. Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend In June, the Associated Press deployed no fewer than a dozen fact-checkers during a speech by Donald Trump that attacked Hillary Clinton. And websites like PolitiFact have been mainstays in the effort to find the truth amid the campaign rhetoric. During debates against Mr. Trump, former Secretary of State Clinton has repeatedly urged viewers to do their own fact checking. PolitiFact’s scorecard finds that, of 292 Trump comments checked, 207 – or 70 percent – are less than "half true," with 17 percent receiving the harshest "Pants on Fire" rating. The organization has judged 270 Clinton statements, finding 27 percent less than "half true," and categorizing 6 (or 2 percent) as "Pants on Fire" falsehoods.  Not everyone agrees with media fact checking. Jeffrey Lord, a former aide to President Reagan who offers a pro-Trump angle on the presidential election for CNN, has described media fact-checking as “elitist” and “out-of-touch.” He says the candidates are the best fact-checkers for each other because ordinary people are most interested in what Clinton and Trump have to say. Others suggest that the truth of the candidates’ statements is less important to voters than the promise of action. “[Voters] don’t hear a pledge, they hear, ‘I’m going to do something,’ ” Kathleen Hall Jamieson, the director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Annenberg Public Policy Center, told the Monitor. The Annenberg Center sponsored a focus group that found that, though few Republicans expected Trump to actually build a wall on the Mexican border, for instance, they supported him because they wanted to see action – and believed he did, too. But for interested readers, the new tag will make it easier to find “fact-check” stories, if all goes according to plan. Websites can include content that alerts the Google algorithm to a “Fact Check” story. Eligible stories should contain the original claim, an assessment of the claim, and how that assessment was reached, Google says. Of course, having a category for “Fact Check” stories doesn’t make any given story more likely to be accurate. Google is only aggregating the content, not providing a guarantee of its trustworthiness. Fewer than 10 organizations used the ClaimReview schema at the time of writing, but this looks set to increase. The company is also taking feedback to help improve its algorithm and deliver content to readers. Richard Gingras, the head of news at Google, said he hopes the new label will boost the work of fact-checkers and help readers find that kind of analysis. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check Community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” he wrote in a Thursday blog post.

By Brandon Vigliarolo | October 14, 2016, 9:48 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Google With every passing iteration of technology more and more of the things we use most move to the cloud. Google knows this, and its G Suite allows users to create, edit, and store documents safely and securely online. Chrome, Google's market-dominating web browser, has also turned into an operating system that's unique to Chromebooks. These budget laptops running Chrome OS are cloud-powered bargains that can help everyone get work done for a fraction of the cost of a MacBook or Windows laptop. More about Mobility CIO Jury: 10 out of 12 tech leaders trust Samsung despite Galaxy Note7 failure IBM Watson is coming to the iPhone, and that's big news for business users Tech Pro Research: Social media policy Subscribe to TechRepublic's Mobile Enterprise newsletter TechRepublic's smart person's guide about Chromebooks is a quick introduction to these laptops, as well as a "living" guide that will be updated periodically as new models and features are released. SEE: Check out all of TechRepublic's smart person's guides. Executive summary What are they? Chromebooks are laptops powered by Google's Chrome OS, an operating system based on the Chrome browser. Chromebooks are very affordable and are built around G Suite, Google's online cloud services. Why do they matter? Cheap laptops running Chrome OS can be easily deployed to students or employees, allowing the machines to be very valuable to the enterprise world. Since most Chromebook work is done in the cloud they're a much lower security risk than typical laptops. Who do they affect? Chromebooks have the potential to affect anyone who relies on the cloud or web apps for most of their work. When are they happening? Chromebooks have been on the market since 2011, and in 2016 they surpassed sales of macOS devices. How do I take advantage of Chromebooks? Chromebooks can be purchased directly from Google and at stores like BestBuy; enterprise solutions are also available. What are Chromebooks? Chromebooks are any laptop that, under license from Google, runs the Linux kernel-based Chrome OS. Chrome OS is incredibly lightweight, drawing almost all of its interface from the Chrome browser. It also supports Chrome apps, and as of late 2016 will be the only platform to get new Chrome apps. Chromebooks are manufactured by a variety of vendors, such as Google, HP, Acer, Samsung, Dell, and others. They range in price from the mid $100 range to over $1,200 for the Google Pixel. Educational pricing is available as well. Android apps are slowly becoming available for Chromebooks too. As of this writing there are still only a few machines that have access to the Google Play store for Android, but the list continues to grow. Google plans to make Android apps available to all Chromebooks in the future, which will make them even more practical and useful. You can see the full list of Chromebooks that can run Android apps on the Chromium Projects site. Additional resources Chromebooks: Tips and tricks to make offline use practical (TechRepublic) 10 apps that make Chromebooks feel like a real desktop (TechRepublic) How to multitask with Google Keep in iOS, Android, and Chrome OS (TechRepublic) Why do Chromebooks matter? Chrome OS is incredibly lightweight, and so are the machines that run it. They can be updated easily, wiped with minimal effort, and are inexpensive enough to be easily replaceable. Schools and businesses are both making use of Chromebooks because of how low maintenance they are. Businesses that use G Suite can make even more use of Chromebooks: integration is simple and instant because users log in with the same Google account they use for work. As Chrome OS continues to evolve and become more practical for everyday use Chromebooks will matter more and more. They have the potential to be cloud-based thin client laptops, potentially disrupting portable computing as we know it.

(ZDNet) Android and Chromebooks: A one-two punch for business (TechRepublic) Chromebooks are the new "it just works" platform (ZDNet) Who do Chromebooks affect? Chromebooks can affect anyone who uses a laptop and does a good portion of their work in the cloud. More and more businesses are turning to cloud hosting through systems like G Suite, meaning it doesn't matter what machine the work is being done on. Chromebooks also affect companies that make laptops and desktops. Chromebooks overtook MacBooks in total sales earlier this year, signaling a shift in computing priorities: the cloud is king and the machine is just a terminal. If computer manufacturers don't find a reason for consumers to buy their machines over cloud-centric Chromebooks the future might be bleak for their profit margins.

Chromebooks have been on the market since 2011, but it's just in the past few years that they've gained momentum. School districts and enterprises are adopting them rapidly, and new features make them even more enticing. The biggest feature coming to Chromebooks in the near future is the addition of Android apps, which will likely increase sales even further. Additional resources Dell brings the Chromebooks to the enterprise (TechRepublic) Make your Chromebook experience even more efficient with these tips (TechRepublic) The future of computing has a name: Chromebook (TechRepublic) How do I take advantage of Chromebooks? Chromebooks are meant for people who already make use of Google's suite of applications. While G Suite use isn't a prerequisite for owning a Chromebook it makes getting up and running much easier. Chromebooks can be purchased at retailers like BestBuy right now, or online directly from Google. Don't dive into a Chromebook before doing your research, though: the market is huge and features vary greatly. Google has a guide for finding the right Chromebook and it's worth going through to find the one that will work best for you.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Internet Google now fact checks news, expands AMP to all mobile search results Internet Google now fact checks news, expands AMP to all mobile search results By Bertila Helena - Google Search has just gotten two major new features with an eye on making itself more useful to people. The first concerns the company’s Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) project, while the second focuses on fact-checking the news. AMP basically loads pages faster than usual, with Google claiming websites which support the feature load in less than a second and consume 10 times less data than normal sites. Pages which support the tool sport a lightning bolt symbol in search results. AMP’s been around for about a year now and Google is highlighting that fact by expanding its reach beyond the news. It was initially restricted to the Top Stories section of Google Search. It can now support any link in the results page in various markets such as Europe and India. Also Read: Google Pixel, Pixel XL go up for pre-orders in India Google stresses that AMP doesn’t affect the answers users get for their queries. Some of the sites which are compatible with the tool are Zomato, eBay, Pinterest, Reddit, WordPress, and Aaj Tak. Publications like the Washington Post have apparently seen a 23% rise in mobile search consumers who return within 7 days and an 88% gain in load time for AMP content over regular mobile web. The second addition focuses on sniffing out the truth in reporting. Google is now rolling out a Fact Check tag in Google News. The platform already has several labels such as In-Depth and Opinion. The new one is meant to make it easier to suss out the facts in large news stories. Users will be able to see the tagged articles when they expand the story box in Google News’ desktop avatar. It’ll also be accessible in the Google News and Weather iOS and Android apps. The add-on will hit the US and UK first.

Meanwhile, in the US, which has consistently made the most requests since at least 2011, authorities sought data on just over 14,000 users. In the first six months of 2015, for comparison, Google received 35,365 requests in total – 9,578 less than the current statistic. Additionally, Google reported that 2016 was the first time it had ever received data requests from Algeria, Belarus, Cayman Islands, El Salvador, Fiji, and Saudi Arabia. "Globally, we received 44,943 government requests for information regarding 76,713 accounts during the first half of 2016," wrote Richard Salgado, company director of law enforcement and infosec in a blog post, adding the firm provided data "in response to 64% of those requests." He continued: As we have noted in the past, when we receive a request for user information, we review it carefully and only provide information within the scope and authority of the request. The privacy and security of the data that users store with Google is central to our approach. "Before producing data in response to a government request, we make sure it strictly follows the law, for example to compel us to disclose content in criminal cases we require the government use a search warrant, and that it complies with Google's strict policies." The transparency notice also revealed the FBI lifted a gag restriction on a National Security Letter (NSL) issued in the second half of 2015. As a result, Google updated these figures from the period – July to December 2015 – from 0-499 to 1-499. NSLs are compel notices that are served by the federal government in the US, usually the FBI. Until recently, the contents of these classified letters were unknown however that changed after a number of major tech firms – including Yahoo – published them online, albeit in a redacted format. According to Salgado, Google also saw an increase in the number of accounts covered by requests made under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is a Watergate-era law that – as explained by the ACLU – "establishes how the government can secretly eavesdrop on Americans in their own country in intelligence investigations."

The battle comes down to Google, the brains behind Android itself and OnePlus, the tiny Chinese brand that has won itself a legion of fans. Google's Pixel phone is days away from launching in the UK and it threatens to blow all the competition out of the water in terms of specs and features. But there's no getting around the fact that Google's creation costs a tonne. As much as Apple's iPhone 7, in fact. Read More Google Pixel and Pixel XL: UK release date, price, specs and features Getty Images Members of the media examine Google's Pixel phone during an event to introduce Google hardware products Read More Google Pixel goes on UK sale TODAY - Best UK deals The OnePlus 3 , by contrast, offers similar levels of performance for a fraction of the price. Which is why we've lined up the two phones side-by-side to see which one is more worthy of your money. Read More Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus - which smartphone will win when Google takes on Apple? Price It's a clear winner for the OnePlus in this category. The 2016 OnePlus 3 model is almost half the price of the premium Pixel phones. The Pixel phones cost £599 for the 32GB model and £699 for the 128GB version. That's if you're going for the 5-inch model. The 5.5-inch Pixel XL is £719 for the 32GB model and £819 for the 128GB one. Read More How much will the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones cost? Best UK deals and where to find them AP Photo/Eric Risberg The new Google Pixel phone is displayed following a product event The OnePlus 3 only comes with a 5.5-inch display and costs £329. That price has gone up thanks to Brexit , but it still makes it a lot more affordable than Google's gadget. Features On paper, Google's Pixel leads the way here. It's got the latest version of Android and is effectively a channel for Google's ever-improving software. The Google Assistant is the voice-controlled digital helper tucked away inside the Pixel while Google Daydream is the company's latest stab at VR. Google's also throwing in a few sweeteners like unlimited storage on Google Photos to help convince you. But when we're talking about pure specs, OnePlus is capable of holding its own. The OnePlus 3 has 6GB of RAM compared to Pixel's 4GB and a 16MP camera compared to Pixel's 12MP. Read More Google Pixel: How much space do you REALLY get on the new 32GB smartphone?

If you're judging on which phone has the best extras, the Pixel takes the prize. Google Pixel launch Google Pixel Review Pixel and Pixel XL specs, price, rumours How much do Google Pixel phones cost? Google Pixel on UK sale Google Pixel XL vs iPhone 7 Plus How much storage on Google Pixel phone? Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3 Google Pixel latest news 1 of 8 Camera We haven't been able to test the Pixel's camera fully yet - so it remains a bit of an unknown quantity at this point. But Google has made a point of saying that, unlike the iPhone 7, there is "no unsightly camera bump" on the back of the Pixel. The Pixel has a 12.3-megapixel camera, featuring an f/2.0 aperture and big 1.55 micron pixels to capture lots of light. While those specs may not sound all that impressive on paper, the Pixel's camera has been given a score of 89 by DxOMark - the industry standard for camera and lens image quality - making it the highest-rated smartphone camera ever tested. The camera app offers a number of clever features like "Smartburst", which takes a rapid-fire sequence of shots and automatically selects the best ones, and "Lens Blur" to achieve shallow depth of field and bokeh effects. Read More How to buy the OnePlus 3 in the UK as O2 reveals plans to stock device The OnePlus 3 OnePlus meanwhile has packed its camera full of features like white balance, shutter speed, ISO and high-dynamic range. There's also optical image stabilisation and the option to support RAW image files for editing on professional software suites. The rear camera uses a 16-megapixel sensor from Sony that's capable of processing 4K video if needed. Here’s an example of a picture taken on a bright day with the OnePlus 3 with HDR disengaged. Conclusion The happy truth is that you're not going to go wrong with either of these phones. Google's Pixel probably just edges it out for us - it's a glimpse at the future of Android and offers a range of features that you just won't get on other smartphones. However, when it comes to balancing the budget, the OnePlus 3 still offers the best deal around. So if you can't afford the Google Pixel, it's a very worthy runner up.

Sometimes, these memes come from dark money-backed content factories funded by tech moguls (looking at you, Palmer Luckey). But more often than not, like Pepe, they come from 4chan. To the uninitiated, 4chan can best be described as a bulging cyst on the ass of the internet. It’s often recognized as a bastion of the alt-right, the main faction boosting Trump’s candidacy online. Trolls from 4chan sometimes orchestrate ugly and racist posting campaigns on the wider web and attract media attention as a result, leaving experts and tech companies wondering how to stem the online tide of politically-motivated hate. Instead of trying to filter keywords used by racists, which are always changing, researchers want to block the source: 4chan. Read More: The Alt-Right Was Conjured Out of Pearl Clutching and Media Attention A team of researchers funded by the European Union’s ENCASE project, which seeks to improve social networks, have completed a large study of user activity on 4chan’s “Politically Incorrect” board, /pol/, and invented a mechanism to detect if trolls from that site are invading other social media sites to spread hate as part of a targeted campaign. “One way to look at countermeasures to hate speech, for Google or for Twitter, is to look at activities on 4chan. Because we do find evidence that some of the hate speech is coming from 4chan,” Emiliano De Cristofaro, a computer scientist at University College London and one of the authors of the study, told me in an interview. One of the goals of the EU’s ENCASE program is to invent browser add-ons for users and server-side software for companies in order to enhance security and privacy on social networks. "It’s much more effective to look at groups and where the content’s coming from, instead of keywords" In the study, which hasn’t been peer-reviewed, the researchers scraped 4chan between June and September, amassing a corpus of eight million posts and over 200,000 threads. Analyzing these, the team was able to correlate upticks in hate speech in the comments of certain YouTube videos to the time the link was posted in a thread on /pol/. The team also looked at Twitter’s firehose of tweets to see if a particular hashtag was being co-opted by 4chan trolls. De Cristofaro and his colleagues used this approach to analyze the effect of “Operation Google,” a campaign launched on /pol/ that asked participants to replace common racial slurs with the names of Google products and other code words. The goal was to get around Google’s algorithmic hate speech filtering. According to the researchers’ study, the trolls’ campaign managed to infiltrate YouTube, but was otherwise largely confined to 4chan itself. “When filtering out hate speech automatically, it’s much more effective to look at groups and where the content’s coming from, instead of keywords,” said De Cristofaro on Operation Google. “The keyword approach can be evaded by switching the terms or using code-words.” There’s something to be said for just ignoring 4chan, /pol/, the alt-right, and trolls altogether. While these groups may have a loud voice online, their champion—Trump—is slipping in the polls regardless as gaffe after gaffe continue to convince much of the public that, amazingly, he’s exactly as bad as he seems upon first inspection. As troll scholar Whitney Phillips noted in a recent essay for Motherboard, media attention (admittedly, just like this article) is the lifeblood of the movement. But their hate does spread beyond the online world where it proliferates. It’s worth mentioning, for instance, that the most popular sites shared on /pol/ besides YouTube and Wikipedia, according to De Cristofaro and his colleagues’ study, were the less-than-reputable right wing “news” outlet Breitbart, and Donald Trump’s own website. A recent Washington Post profile on a mentally ill Trump supporter illustrated how the half-truths and toxic attitudes that ooze from such sites often buoy pro-Trump sentiment. “The alt-right is using 4chan as a source for information,” DeCristofaro said. “Whether you like it or not, 4chan is very popular and has a lot of influence.” Get six of our favorite Motherboard stories every day by signing up for our newsletter.

 The most popular Google searches for Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton speak volumes Ben Gilbert Oct. 14, 2016, 1:11 PM 32,197 facebook linkedin twitter email print Amid the political pundits, pollsters, and stump speeches, it's easy to get lost this election season. So much noise! And in times like this, Americans often turn to an emotionless medium for their political questions: Google. It's there that you'll find some of the most revealing questions Americans have about the US's two major-party presidential nominees. For those interested in what those questions are, Google has a service called Google Trends. If you're looking for what people are searching on Google, Trends is the place to explore as much. Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, Juanita Broaddrick, and Kathy Shelton at the presidential town-hall debate on Sunday night in St. Louis. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Given that we're just a few short weeks away from the November 8 presidential election, Google Trends has been cataloging what people are searching for on each candidate on a day-to-day basis. And what they're searching for speaks volumes. Here's a look at what people are searching for most when it comes to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the past day: The chart on the left measures the past week, while the one on the right is just the past 24 hours. Google Based on those questions, it's clear that both Trump supporters and nonsupporters alike are looking for information on Trump's campaign. Most tellingly, based on the chart to the left, people are looking up what Trump said most recently instead of his main policy tentpoles: building a wall along the US/Mexico border, defeating ISIS, and strengthening the economy. Things get even more revealing when you look at general searches related to Trump's campaign: Google The top two results are Natasha Stoynoff and Jessica Leeds — two of the women who this week accused Trump of sexual assault. It's not surprising that their names are the top-trending searches related to Trump's campaign, given that the sexual-assault allegations leveled at Trump are dominating news coverage of his campaign. He has repeatedly brought up the allegations himself in stump speeches since accusers came forward in several articles published this week. Looking at the same trend charts for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton offers a look into a campaign that's seemingly more in control of its messaging: Google First lady Michelle Obama, a surrogate for Clinton's campaign, was a popular search query after her speech on Thursday went viral. Another thing that went viral, however, was the second-highest result: Clinton's Wikipedia page was replaced with porn earlier this week (it's been fixed). More interesting in Clinton's case is the type of questions people are asking on Google: Google Unlike the questions people are asking Google about Trump, the questions people are asking about Clinton have more to do with her as a person than her faults. The chart to the right suggests the most notable negatives attached to Clinton are storylines involving the attack on the American embassy in Libya ("Benghazi"), the private email server she used while serving as secretary of state ("emails"), and her family's charity ("Clinton Foundation"). Yet, outside the least searched question, it looks as if few people are turning to Google to ask questions critical of Clinton. Instead, they're wondering whether Fox News host Megyn Kelly is voting for Clinton or Trump.

Ltd.), have announced that they will co-build the Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN), a 12,800 km transpacific submarine cable system that will provide the first direct undersea route between Hong Kong and Los Angeles, California (USA) with ultra-high capacity transmission. — Brian Quigley, Director, Google Networking Infrastructure: The Pacific Light Cable Network (PLCN) will have an estimated cable capacity of 120 Tbps, making it the highest-capacity trans-Pacific route, a record currently held by another Google-backed cable system, FASTER. "In other words, PLCN will provide enough capacity for Hong Kong to have 80 million concurrent HD video conference calls with Los Angeles - an example of Google Cloud Platform having the largest network backbone of any public cloud provider." — This is the sixth submarine cable in which Google has an ownership stake - joining the ranks of the Unity, SJC, FASTER, MONET and Tannat projects. We anticipate that PLCN will be operational in 2018. — PLCN is scheduled for commercial launch in summer of 2018.

At the end of this tutorial, you’ll be able to completely disable tabs on Google Chrome such that all the URLs will open up in a new window and not tab. If you’re a Google Chrome user, then you might have noticed that wherever you click on any URL, it will either open up in the same tab or in a new tab. Google Chrome doesn’t have any native option to disable tabs to open links in new window, but there is a way using which you can do the same. So, today in this tutorial, I will explain how to disable Chrome tabs to open links in a new window in Chrome. Actually, there is a free Chrome extension called “New Tab, New Window” which you can use to disable tabs in Chrome. It actually forces Chrome to open all the URLs in a new window (Chrome instance) instead of opening them in new tabs. In addition to that, if you would like to open links from external programs such as MS Word, PDF readers, etc. in a new Chrome window, then there is another simple registry hack which can do the job for you. Sponsored Links If you’re looking for a way to forcefully open all the links in the same tab in Chrome, then you can check out our post on How to Force URLs to open in the same tab in Chrome, IE, Firefox. How to Disable Chrome Tabs to Open Links in New Window in Chrome: The process of disabling Chrome tabs using the “New Tab, New Window” extension is very simple, as all you got to do is install the extension and you’re done. Step 1: First, simply install the Chrome extension “New Tab, New Window” on your browser. After installing the extension, it will automatically disable Chrome tabs and all the links will open up in a new window in Chrome instead of a new tab. For example, let’s say you’re reading an article and you found a link to another article which you want to open in a new window. Then the possible option for that is to right-click on it and then choose “Open in New Window” from the context menu. But, if you’ve installed this extension, then you don’t need to do that as you can simply click on the link and it will directly open up in a new Chrome window. Step 2: No manual configuration is required to disable Chrome tabs after installing the extension. However, you can change the position of the new window either as default (cascade) or same as the parent window. For this, simply right-click on the extension icon and select “Options”. After that, a new popup will appear where you can choose the position of the new window, as shown below. How to Always Open URLs from External Programs in New Chrome Window: Step 1: To get started, the first thing you need to do is press “Windows Key + R” to open “Run” prompt and then type “regedit” in the input field. After that hit Enter and it will open up the registry editor. Step 2: Now, you need to navigate to the following registry key location in the registry editor: "HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\ChromeHTML\shell\open\command" Step 3: After you navigate to this key location, you’ll see a key value named “Default” on the right panel. Double-click on the key value to open up the string editor. In the “Value Data” field, you will be able to see a long string ending with -- "%1". Step 4: Now, you need to replace -- "%1" with --new-window "%1" at the end of the “Value Data” string. As soon as you do that, click “OK” and close the registry editor. After that, whenever you click on a link in any external program like MS Word, PDF Viewer, Powerpoint, etc., it will always open up in a new Chrome window instead of in new tab. My Final Verdict: If you’re looking for a way to disable tabbed browsing in Chrome such that you can open up links in new windows in Chrome, then this tutorial is definitely for you. In this tutorial, I was able to completely disable Chrome tabs using the “New Tab, New Window” extension to open links in new window. I was also able to open links from external programs in new windows with the help of a simple registry hack. Get “New Tab, New Window” from here.

Just in time for the US presidential election, Google is rolling out a "fact check" tag to its News service. Google News aggregates stories from various sources (including PCMag), identifying them via labels like "highly cited," "featured," "opinion," "in depth," and now, "fact check." Fact checking, once a job that was relegated to interns and entry-level reporters, "has come into its own," Google News head Richard Gingras wrote in blog post. "Rigorous fact checks are now conducted by more than 100 active sites," he said, citing the Duke University Reporter's Lab. "They collectively product many thousands of fact-checks a year, examining claims around urban legends, politics, health, and the media itself." Google's algorithms will determine which articles may contain fact checks using the schema.org ClaimReview system; it also looks for sites that follow commonly accepted criteria for fact checks. Publishers interested in applying to have their service included can find more details online. News junkies in the US and UK will see new tagged reports in the expanded story box on the Web and in the Google News & Weather iOS and Android apps. "We're excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin," Gingras said. //Related Articles Facebook, Twitter to Tackle Fake News Google began labeling types of articles seven years ago, making it easier for readers to access a range of content. Earlier this year, it added a "Local Source" tag to highlight local coverage of major topics. The news comes as Facebook is grappling with a spate of fake news in its trending section. Amidst concern that its trending news team was surfacing only liberal news, Facebook ditched human curators for algorithms. But its algorithms are apparently rather gullible. Facebook later joined an organization dedicated to tackling misinformation online, alongside Twitter and more than two dozen other tech and media titans. In other Google search news, Search Engine Land reports reports that Google will soon favor its mobile search index over desktop. "Google is going to create a separate mobile index within months, one that will be the main or 'primary' index that the search engine uses to respond to queries," the blog says. The desktop index will remain but won't be updated as often as the mobile one.

Facebook Live is no longer relegated to the social network's app. Web and iOS users can now stream content from Facebook to their television set through devices like Apple TV or Google Chromecast; it's coming soon to Android. "We're focused on creating video experiences that people want, and we've heard that people want different options for how and where they watch videos that they discover on Facebook," product director Brent Ayrey wrote in an announcement. So, gather some friends and snacks, search your phone or desktop for an interesting video, and press the TV symbol in the top-right corner to select a streaming device (any AirPlay- or Google Cast-enabled gadget). Then kick back and watch the latest Rogue One trailer on the boob tube. While you watch, you can continue scrolling through your Facebook News Feed. You'll see real-time reactions and comments to the video you're watching on the TV screen. If you're looking for something to watch, be sure to check out PCMag's Random Access, live from PC Labs every week day at 10 a.m. ET (today's episode is embedded below) and the mobile-focused Dialed In, every Tuesday at 3 p.m. ET. //Related Articles Prepare For an All-Video Facebook Feed Video has exploded on Facebook in the last year or so (allegedly). And the social network dove head-first into it with the December launch of Live Video, which allows users to broadcast clips to the social network in real time. The company in April beefed up the service by adding the ability to go live in Facebook groups and events, add filters, and post varied reactions as a viewer. You can also now skip ahead to the good parts of recorded videos and live stream for up to four hours.

We’ve already seen Google Assistant running on the Nexus 6P, but the one new feature that has remained inaccessible is Google Camera 4.2 that ships with the Pixel devices. This version of the app requires the 7.1 version of Android Nougat, so until now it has been unavailable on Nexus devices which don’t have that update yet. XDA Developers has ported the app to work on Android 7.0 devices and they’ve confirmed it works on the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P so far. The developers note that they haven’t changed the build.prop in any way and because this is a modified version of Google Camera, it won’t install itself over your official camera app. Download Google Camera 4.2 apk local_offer    Google Camera   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (6) stars Further Reading Google Camera getting RAW support Google Camera for Android N Google Camera to get Goggles tech Download: Google Camera 3.1 w/new UI and 6.0+ features stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Google News launches fact check label for readers wanting 100% accuracy The perfect tool for news-hungry readers wanting to know what they are reading is right BY JANE DENTON 14th October 2016, 5:21 pm Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) Click to share on WhatsApp (Opens in new window) Comments US-BASED technology giant Google News has launched a new “fact check” label to help readers gauge fact from fiction in the bountiful world of online news. Richard Gingras, Google’s head of news, said the tool will “help readers find fact checking in large news stories.” Getty Images 2 Google News is offering readers the chance to check facts in online news articles Through an algorithmic process, live stories are linked to fact checking articles and websites, allowing readers to decipher fact from spin. Having launched today, Google’s fact check label appears among news search results, alongside other more established labels, including opinion, local source and highly cited. In a blog post, Google said an article will be flagged up in the new category if it has a certain website code and if it follows the “commonly accepted criteria for fact checks.” RELATED STORIES So sketchy From Antoni van Leeuwenhoek to Mary Seacole - what is the history of the Google Doodle?

In Google News, fact check labels are visible in the expanded story box on the Google News site, on both the iOS and Android apps, and roll out for users in the US and UK first. One example of where the tool is in use today features “Trump’s Misguided Debate Bias Claim”. From here, readers are taken to an explanation of the claim on the FactCheck.org web page. Google 2 This is how Google New’s new fact check label appears on screen It is no coincidence that the label has been launched by the US tech giant weeks before the Clinton versus Trump presidential battle reaches its peak. Sites which already have a fact checking service can apply to be included to appear in search results. According to the the Duke University Reporter’s Lab, there are currently more than 100 fact checking sites online, the BBC reports. Facebook, despite its increasingly critical role in the distribution of news, has yet to roll out any fact-checking feature. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

NFL NBA CFB MLB Soccer UFC NHL WWE Golf NASCAR CBB More Trending Lab Lists Video Tickets Golden St Warriors Draymond Green's Defense of Kevin Durant Reveals a Hidden NBA Truth By Erik Malinowski , Golden State Warriors Lead Writer Oct 14, 2016 Share Tweet Next ARTICLE » Use your ← → (arrow) keys to browse more stories Noah Graham/Getty Images 174.0K Reads 340 Comments Ever since Kevin Durant announced July 4 that he was leaving the Oklahoma City Thunder for the Golden State Warriors—the same Warriors who had just knocked the Thunder out of the Western Conference Finals in seven games—the criticism has been constant and unyielding. From that day more than three months ago until now, past and present players have been coming out every couple of days to tsk-tsk Durant's decision: Charles Barkley, Reggie Miller, Damian Lillard, Markieff Morris and Tracy McGrady.  One salty remark after another. The popular storyline goes that Durant basically duped the people of Oklahoma City into thinking he was going to stay and then was peer-pressured into bolting for the allure of a team on the brink of greatness. And Draymond Green reached his breaking point Thursday afternoon. A day after Paul Pierce gave a SiriusXM interview in which he expanded on his memorable July 4 tweet and said, among other things, that today's players are not "as hungry or as competitive as my generation was," Green laid into Pierce after an afternoon practice in Denver: "Nobody complain when somebody leave Apple and go to Google," Green said, per Anthony Slater of the San Jose Mercury News. "Aren't they in competition with each other? Nobody talk junk about the CEO who leaves Apple and goes to Google. As a basketball player, you are the CEO of a business. You are a business. Kevin Durant is a big business. He is the CEO of that business. So him going to play basketball for a different team, the CEO decided to leave where he was at and go somewhere else. "But there's so many guys in this league that are so stupid they don't think like that. They don't think business wise. It happens every day in the world. But in basketball it's a problem. Aren't you competitive in your day job if you work for Apple? Don't you want to outdo Google? What's the difference on the basketball court. It's your day job. You want to do what's better for you." Durant, to his credit, has been as thoughtful and forthcoming during his transition to Bay Area life as anyone in his position could be expected to be, given the pressure he's under and the narrative that quickly coalesced in the wake of his decision.  So while Durant was clearly peeved earlier this week when comments he made during a Warriors panel discussion at Stanford were taken out of context—"Man, whatever I say is going to be twisted up," he said after practice Tuesday, "so I'm only just going to say how I feel from now on"—he's largely taken everything in stride as the season quickly approaches. But it's no accident that Green was the one to finally snap. He is the emotional leader of this Warriors team, a role that has served head coach Steve Kerr and the players to great benefit over the past two seasons. When Golden State is down by 10 or 12 at the half, it's Green who makes the locker room speech. He is the star on this team who will not hesitate to self-sacrifice for the good of another. Sometimes that emotion can manifest itself in an unfortunate (and painful) way, but this is who he is. He's been like this the second he stepped on an NBA court as a second-round pick feeling a mountain-size sleight. So after months of the Warriors' new star taking one public drubbing after another, from players who had never won a title (Barkley, Miller), never had to make a similar decision (Lillard, Morris) or were themselves the beneficiary of a manufactured superteam (Pierce), it was only natural that Green would so forcefully come to Durant's defense.  Noah Graham/Getty Images Thank goodness he did, because what Green said about today's NBA should be a model for how younger players control their own destiny. After an offseason that saw many such as Lillard, Memphis' Mike Conley and Washington's Bradley Beal sign contracts worth more than what almost every Hall of Famer made in his entire playing career, it's more important than ever that players recognize the power they possess with regard to their future employment. The emotional attachment still plays a role, yes, but the business aspect is now an integral and inescapable part of how players decide their respective futures.  Green's comparison of players to tech CEOs was perhaps correct in the sense of "branding" (ugh), but a more apt example centers on the engineers who are in such high demand at these companies. It's true that workers move all the time from Apple to Google to Facebook to Amazon and sometimes back around again to a previous company, and even all of that gets more complicated as you take non-compete clauses and other conditions into account. But Green's point is valid: Hiring managers and headhunters fight like hell to bring in the best coders and programmers, promising perks and a better quality of life to people with highly specialized skills that are hard to replicate or replace—kind of like elite basketball players. The other simple reality that so many critics seem to forget? Durant, as a free agent operating within the bounds of the collective bargaining agreement, was fully within his rights to choose his next employer. Teams, in turn, must do their duty to convince him of their merits. And yet, all the ire, especially from way over yonder in OKC, seemed focused on Durant (who made an informed decision) and not in the direction of general manager Sam Presti (who has cleverly portrayed Durant's departure as some kind of fait accompli) or team owner Clay Bennett or even Russell Westbrook (who did not attend the Thunder's sit-down meeting with Durant in the Hamptons) for letting him walk. The Warriors, let's remember, brought along not just Green but Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala, in addition to several team executives. Durant, ultimately, made a many-layered decision. It was personal, moving to an environment that was unfamiliar and exciting. It was professional, considering the opportunities that awaited him in a new and larger market. It was competitive, since the chances of him winning a title with Golden State are exponentially higher than with OKC. Sure, Durant could've perhaps been more gracious in saying his final goodbye to the Thunder fans who cheered and loved him for so many years. But this was not a decision he made lightly, and there's been little public defense of his thought process—only a stream of knee-jerk vitriol from a variety of agenda-driven sources. Noah Graham/Getty Images I wager that the Warriors will be an even stronger bunch in the wake of Green's comments. Kerr is a coach who wants his players to be happy, and team ownership takes pride in cultivating a workplace that fosters open communication. In the Warriors' continuing hunt to build team chemistry with Durant, this episode may serve to solidify some long-term bonds. I can only imagine what the team group chat looks like at this very moment. The bottom line is that the Dubs figure to win a whole lot of games this season. It's no coincidence that Pierce's comments came just a week after Golden State annihilated the Clippers in their preseason home opener at Oracle Arena. As the losses pile up, the comments from opposing locker rooms may only get more bitter, but the Warriors have to expect that. They've seen a barrage of such talk for months and the season hasn't even begun. And it won't stop (Golden State hopes) until at least mid-June. There may yet be future opportunities for other Warriors to come to a teammate's defense, be that Durant or someone else, but Green did his job here. Especially after the events of last June's Finals, when Green's Game 5 suspension arguably cost the Warriors their best chance at repeating as champions, he has now reaffirmed his role on this team, as their best defender, both on and off the court. He's the guy who does what others won't do and says what others won't say.  In this case, it was exactly what Durant—and the Warriors—needed to hear.          Erik Malinowski is the Golden State Warriors lead writer for B/R.

Google’s decision to add a fact-checking tag is based both on the popularity of its tagging system as well as the growth of fact-checking. “Over the last several years, fact checking has come into its own,” writes Google head of news Richard Gingras, citing Duke University Reporter’s Lab list of over 100 sites that now fact-check. To get the fact-check tag attached to an item, news orgs need to first add schema.org ClaimReview markup language to news items that feature a fact-check so that Google can identify the item. “We also look for sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks,” writes Gingras. That criteria include articles that clearly identify facts, which are clearly checked and explained with appropriate and accessible citations and sources, especially primary. There’s criteria for the orgs doing the fact-checking as well, which “must be nonpartisan, with transparent funding and affiliations.” You’ll be able to see articles with the tag starting now. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

SUBSCRIBE What you need to reach the big leagues of local SEO Looking to build a successful career in local SEO? Columnist Brian Smith is here to coach you on how to improve your game. Brian Smith on October 14, 2016 at 10:21 am More Ffooter / Shutterstock.com It’s that time of year again. The air becomes crisp, the crack of the bat fills the stadium, the crowd roars — Chicago Cubs fans like me get that old, familiar feeling of foreboding. Major League Baseball’s playoffs are upon us, and in the spirit of the postseason, it’s time we explore how the great American pastime applies to building a successful career in local SEO. The right stuff If you aspire to local SEO success, you’ve got to have the right stuff. The competition in the industry is fierce, and it’s not easy to stand out among your peers. If you’re looking to wow the scouts, or if you’re considering lacing up your cleats for the first time and joining the local SEO game, these are the qualities and skills that talented young SEOs must have: Adaptability. The local SEO landscape is constantly changing. SEOs need to be comfortable with the fact that each day they log on in the morning, it’s a whole new ballgame. What was relevant yesterday might no longer be relevant today. Google alone updates its algorithms over a thousand times a year. If you’re looking for consistency and predictability in a career, local SEO is not it. However, if you thrive on the challenge and excitement of never knowing what Google will throw at you next, you might just have what it takes. Hunger for continual improvement. You’ve got to have that hunger, that desire to constantly learn and improve your SEO skills. Good is never good enough — not if you want to rise to the top. There’s always a way to improve SEO performance. Find it! Become a stats fanatic. Search algorithms are so complex and have so many variables that once you’ve learned the SEO basics, any additional performance gains come through constant experimentation and complex data interpretation. A successful SEO relishes A/B testing and digital sleuthing. Embrace the stats. SEO is a lot like the movie, “Moneyball” — though it’s more Jonah Hill than Brad Pitt. Talk the talk. Communication is an absolutely critical skill to local SEOs. Maintaining quality relationships with both clients and the other departments within your organization requires effective oral and written communication skills. A knack for behavioral science and psychology. At all times, a local SEO must have three groups in mind: 1) the end user who actually uses the search results, 2) the brand you represent and 3) the search engines. Local SEOs who can intuit the needs of these three groups are setting themselves up for a long career of SEO success. Specialize. Whether you focus on enterprise brands or SMBs, it’s important that you play to your own strengths. Just as in baseball, there are different positions and skillsets; find your own niche, and play to your strengths. Learn from the best If you’re looking to get a leg up on the competition, it’s important to learn from the best, from those who lead and define the industry. In local SEO, you’ll find that there are a few who stand taller than the rest of the field. If you’re not already following local search experts like David Mihm, Mike Blumenthal, Mary Bowling, Linda Buquet, Darren Shaw, Mike Ramsey, and the other local search columnists at Search Engine Land, now’s the time to start. But it’s not just the league leaders you should be paying attention to. If you’re just starting out, look to the veterans on your own team. The quickest way to develop your skills is to work alongside someone who can show you the ropes. Likewise, look to the communities and forums for help and insight, especially after any major algorithm updates. The collective knowledge of local SEOs is a powerful tool. Use it. Striking out Local SEO often feels like you’re up to bat with Google on the mound, and the search engine giant is staring you down, and you’re left trying to guess the next pitch. You might be expecting a fastball, but inevitably Google will throw you a curve and change up the algorithm on you. The result: a swing and a miss. Here’s an important lesson for all local SEOs (and for all SEOs, for that matter): failure is an unavoidable aspect of the SEO game. The search algorithms are so complex and change so often that after you’ve mastered the basics, it’s mostly trial and error to achieve significant gains after that. If something you tried didn’t work, dust yourself off, study the data and try something different. Remember, it’s a long season. Tomorrow is another day. Learn from your last at bat and try something different the next time. Striking out every now and then is inevitable. Failing to learn from that experience is unacceptable. Just don’t fail too often or you’ll be out of the job and out of the league. No pressure. Be a utility player Though it’s important to specialize in your given field, that doesn’t mean you should be a one-trick pony. When it comes to local SEO, the hat you wear today might not be the hat you wear tomorrow. Things change so rapidly in this business that you should expect your role within the team to constantly evolve. For example, cleaning up geocodes and manually placing pins is a time consuming process. But that doesn’t mean tomorrow Google won’t come out with an update to the Google My Business API that will allow us to automatically update geocodes. If that day comes, acknowledge the change, adapt, improve, and look for the next area to put your effort into. In local SEO, it’s important to constantly look to the future and anticipate it. The Penguin update was predicted long before it actually arrived. All signs point to AMP being the future of mobile. The signs are there for those willing to look. Begin laying the groundwork for looming industry changes now and you won’t get caught flatfooted when they do come to pass. Play the local SEO game the right way “Say it ain’t so, Joe,” but integrity is an important aspect of both baseball and local SEO. Sure, you have your cheaters in both domains, but eventually they get caught and punished. Google is constantly getting better at catching spam links and bogus local listings. You might be able to stay ahead of the search engines for a while, but eventually you’ll get caught, and you’ll have to pay the consequences. Play the local SEO game the right way, and you’ll be much more likely to have success in the long run. And that brings me to the most important lesson about local SEO. There are no shortcuts. No easy ways to the top. To gain expertise in local SEO, you’ll have to earn it, you’ll have to grind it out. But hey, that’s part of the fun.

SUBSCRIBE What Google’s experimental content podium means for SEO What's the deal with Google Posts? Columnist Tony Edward explains this invite-only Google feature and discusses its potential implications for search marketers. Tony Edward on October 14, 2016 at 10:58 am More Google has been testing a new content platform called “Posts with Google,” and it could have a huge impact on brand searches, for both paid and organic. We all know that Google has had its struggles with trying to develop its own social network; Google Buzz is dead, and Google Plus seems to be on its way out. This new platform seems to have some social elements to it, though it is very different from a social network. On the official site for this platform, Google states the following: Every day millions of people search on Google, many of whom are looking for information about prominent individuals and organizations. Now we’re experimenting with a new way for users to hear directly from select entities they’re searching for on Google. Verified individuals and organizations can now communicate with text, images and videos directly on Google. Creating content is fast and simple, and once published, posts will appear instantly in search results related to the publisher. Each post can also be shared on popular social networks. So it appears the goal for this platform is to provide real-time updates from individuals and organizations when someone performs a direct brand search. This complements Google’s Knowledge Graph results, which provide quick information for entities. Google was already doing this real-time update by having official Twitter profiles and a tweet feed appearing for searches for entities. Let’s take a look at the platform. Check out the Tory Burch profile on posts.google.com. As you can see, it resembles a company social network profile page. It has a post feed, profile photo and what appears to be a cover photo/banner. The Tory Burch content feed is also appearing for branded searches. Notice the content carousel that sits below the paid ads and at the top of the organic search listings. This platform has a strong social integration as well; social share buttons are prominent on the profile and in the content carousel that appears in the SERPs. Impact on search This podium feature is still experimental, and right now it’s “invite only.” But if Google opens this up to more individuals and brands, it will have a major impact. As you can see in the Tory Burch content carousel above, the Google Posts content is very prominent and includes links, images and videos. This type of result can steal clicks from both paid ads and organic results. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing, as the links within your posts can direct users to your website, which can save you budget on the paid search side. From a conversion standpoint, this platform allows you to post real-time updates, such as sales or promotions, which can help increase conversions on your site. This can also help distract users from negative results that may be present on page one of your branded search results. It would be interesting if Google provided reporting metrics for this result type, such as organic impressions and clicks in the Search Analytics Report via Search Console (as they currently do for web pages). At this point, we have to wait and see what Google decides to do. There is currently a waitlist to use this platform, and I would highly recommend signing up if you are representing a brand or business. Visit the signup page here.

The move comes in the wake of the increase in fact-checking by online organizations, especially with regard to claims by politicians and public speakers. An official statement from Google reads, “In the seven years since we started labeling types of articles in Google News (e.g., In-Depth, Opinion, Wikipedia), we’ve heard that many readers enjoy having easy access to a diverse range of content types. Today, we’re adding another new tag, ‘Fact check,’ to help readers find fact checking in large news stories.” The fact-check feature works through an algorithmic procedure from Schema.org referred to as Claim Review, where live stories are linked to fact-checking articles and websites. The process allows readers to validate or debunk information they read on the internet as fast as possible. #googleoffice #googlelogo A photo posted by Tal Haguel (@talhag) on Sep 27, 2016 at 10:06am PDT During the process, fact-checking articles will appear on the screen below the main headline. The search engine giant used an example of a headline over passport checks for an expectant woman, with a link to Full Fact’s analysis of the subject matter. Through the fact-checking feature, readers will be able to establish if stories are false, claims in the headline are fake, or if there is an exaggeration in the information given. Google said that the new fact-checking feature would first be available in the United Kingdom and the United States through the Google News site. The feature will also be available on the news and weather apps for both iOS and Android platforms. Those who would like to become a part of the new service are encouraged to apply to have their websites included. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Google added. Google is not the first organization to make a move on fact-checking. A report from Duke University Reporter’s Lab revealed that there are over 100 fact-checking sites online, including BBC’s Reality Check. The feature has now become increasingly common, with firms like the International Fact-Checking Network, PolitFact, and FullFact analyzing speeches by politicians and other public speakers to establish whether or not they are true. Google’s head of new, Richard Gingras, pointed out that such publishers that already have fact checking services can still apply to be included in the search results. Last winter I asked my team to include a mock of this very thing in one of the very first presentations. Blown away at how hard they have worked to realize this @google #googlelogo A photo posted by Jonathan Lee (@hifromjonathan) on Sep 1, 2015 at 9:50pm PDT However, not all fact-checking sites run by algorithm have managed to fulfill their intended purpose. According to a report by the Independent, Facebook has had a difficult time preventing false headlines from appearing in its own trending news feature. The leading social media company changed human curators for an algorithm when a fake story about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly being sacked over allegiances to Hilary Clinton caused conflict. The fact-checking feature from Google comes in time for the final round of the U.S. presidential elections. Although Google does not name Brexit or Donald Trump openly, authors like Ralph Keyes allege that people now live in a “post-truth” period. According to the author, this is an era when debates rarely focus on facts or policy, but rather on wild claims and emotions. Donald Trump, the U.S. Republican presidential candidate, in many cases has been found making misleading or false statements. PolitFact has rated 71 percent of Trump’s statements as false. The presidential candidate this week wrongly advised his supporters to go out and vote on November 28, which is 20 days after the United States’ actual election date.

For a limited time, KNFB Reader will be offered for the reduced price of $19.99 for the Android app. KNFB Reader is a mobile app that reads print aloud. It’s easy to use. Take a photo and the app reads the text aloud in clear synthetic speech. And it’s fast–the print will be yours almost instantaneously. The app is fully accessible thanks to Google TalkBack and app functionalities that guide the blind user in independently taking the perfect picture. The app can currently recognize text in nineteen different languages, and is compatible with connected Braille displays. Mark A. Riccobono, President of the National Federation of the Blind, said: “We are delighted that continued support from Google will allow us to further develop the KNFB Reader app and to get this life-changing technology into the hands of more people who can benefit from it. We deeply appreciate Google’s continued support because it means that more people who are blind or who have print disabilities will have a quick and convenient means of accessing the printed word.” One new KNFB Reader user said, “I had a minor medical procedure recently and upon discharge I was given a pile of papers which included my reported results. For the first time in my life, I was able to read my report in privacy and independently. If you are still wondering whether to buy this app, all I can say is that for me it was a good investment. I can imagine myself using the KNFB reader on a daily basis.” To purchase KNFB Reader, visit the Google Play store:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sensotec.knfbreader About the National Federation of the Blind: The National Federation of the Blind knows that blindness is not the characteristic that defines you or your future. Every day we raise the expectations of blind people, because low expectations create obstacles between blind people and our dreams. You can live the life you want; blindness is not what holds you back. – USNewswire Tags Google Play people support time CIEDITOR-BALA Related Posts Global carbon emissions remain flat for third year Nov 14th, 201605 London, Nov 14 (IANS) Global carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels are projected to rise only slightly...

Participants in the OpenCAPI group include IBM, Google, Nvidia, Mellanox, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Micron and Xilinx. Chris Johnson, a Principal Engineer at Google commented 'Google is committed to open standards and we are excited to contribute to the cross-industry use and development of OpenCAPI'. Google's collaboration with RackSpace on the Zaius server will include IBM's forthcoming POWER9 processor technology, which is built around OpenCAPI. Tom Eby, vice president of Micron's compute and networking business said:"While memory has always been an essential building block for computing, it is quickly becoming the critical technology to unlocking next-generation performance." google hp ibm ← You may like to read: → Google To Divide Its Index, Giving Mobile Users Better and Fresher Content Silicon Valley Investors Call For California To Secede From the US After Trump Win Ask Slashdot: Would You Recommend Updating To Windows 10?

Douglas Soltys October 14, 2016 11:31am With a flurry of new product announcements, and finally, a suite of self-made hardware, Google has finally stepped outside the frenemy zone, and in direct competition, not only with Apple, but with its own partners. Dieter Bohn of The Verge posed the question: if you’re Google, would you trust the future of the company to your hardware partners? This week, CanCon poses another one: why now? After 8 long years of Android, why did Google finally decide that now was the time for an end-to-end solution? Beyond announcing a phone, Google also revealed a bevy of other products, among which was its latest iteration of affordable VR gear. It was not the only notable VR announcement this week, however, with PlayStation VR, Facebook-owned Oculus, and Canadian-made Sulon Q all in the news. Will VR ever truly make it into the hands of the average consumer, and if so, what will that world look like? Tune in as CanCon’s podcast crew – Erin Bury, Managing Director of 88 Creative, Patrick O’Rourke, MobileSyrup Senior Editor, Rob Kenedi, TWG’s Entrepreneur in Residence and host of the amazing #smallrooms podcast,and Douglas Soltys, BetaKit Editor in Chief – speculate on if we’re headed for a snow crash.

John W Douglas they need to get you onto the MS podcast more often, excellent podcast. Douglas tr0n Soltys I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE Rose You’re in luck… watch out for this week’s ep featuring the man himself! John W Well isn’t that a peach! thereasoner In my view these phones were never about competing with Apple so much as offering Samsung some competition in the premium Android market. The modular approach chosen by some established OEMs has largely failed to gain traction, others like Sony can’t break from the past by offering something new and different and other than some Chinese brands being successful at devaluing Android with high spec low cost offerings there is nothing challenging Samsung at the premium price tier within the Android ecosystem currently. Samsungs dominance in the premium segment is so complete it’s like they are the makers of Android really, they hold all the cards as far as how that OS is going to be perceived from affluent buyers. In steps Google with their own premium products that pull away from the previous Nexus strategy abdominal aline themselves in line against the best of what Android has to offer. I’m sure that the thought of Samsung one day breaking away with their own Tizen OS and leaving Android in the lurch was also a motivating factor but Apple? Umm, no. They’re not the driving force behind this move, at best they are an after thought in this case imo. John W I have to say, a couple years ago i would have figured that Samsung would have tried to start pushing Tizen by now. I am not sure how much development time they put into it, but with Google having its own phones now, and the likelihood of Google phone only features it makes me worry for other OEM’s. thereasoner They do use it in phones for the Asian markets, nothing high end though and they’ve got a long way to go in replacing Google services. Tizen is nothing without Google, even MS has a hard time and they’re way ahead of Tizen. kirfer “end-to-end”? Head to head, maybe?

But the machines are learning that just like the robots of sci-fi blockbusters, being able to tell one thing from another is a key skill. A team of UK researchers has created software which has taught itself to recognise objects around it, with impressive accuracy. Scroll down for video  UK researchers have created software, called RadarCat, which can teach itself to recognise objects around it with impressive accuracy . Pictured is the platform recognising a Nexus smartphone placed on a radar sensor Called the RadarCat, short for radar categorisation for input and interaction, the software scans the world around it uses radar to scan the world around it. Tests in the computer lab have shown the platform, created by researchers at St Andrews University in Scotland, can correctly identify everything from a sponge to a block of wood and even tell if a glass has water in it or not.

The approach is reaching increasingly impressive milestones in the real world, such as Google-backed machine learning platform Deep Mind being able to navigate the London Underground network, a task which regularly stumps tourists. By using a machine learning approach, the software learns from a few examples in order to work out the parameters. The software was able to correctly identify everything from a sponge to a block of wood and even tell if a glass has water in it or not (pictured left and right) At the heart of the technology is Google’s Project Soli, a sensing technology which uses disruptions in radar signal to detect non-touch gestures SEEING WITH RADAR  In order for the software to interact with the real world, the team at St Andrews turned to a novel piece of hardware.  Google’s Project Soli uses radar sensors to detect non-touch gestures. By combining the machine learning software with the Soli sensors, the platform is able to detect and work out what objects in its environment are. In this way, RadarCat could be used to change how people interact with computers. The team gives one possible example as an application for blind people to work out the contents of identical containers, such as a carton of milk and orange juice. Objects are placed in front of a sensor which detects changes to a radar field and works out what it is ‘looking’ at. It can even identify different body parts. At the heart of the technology is Google’s Project Soli, a sensing technology which uses disruptions in radar signal to detect non-touch gestures. A video of RadarCat in action, which the team showed to Google at its Californian headquarters earlier this year, shows the platform identifying apples, oranges, smartphones, tablet computers, cases and more. The team was also able to create a painting app, with the brush changing function depending on which surface it was placed on. In a final demonstration, the Soli device is connected to an Android smartphone and placed against different areas of the body.  Combined with the clever software, it is able to detect which body part it is scanning and whether the region is covered or not.

Professor Aaron Quigley, who led the research, said: ‘The Soli miniature radar opens up a wide-range of new forms of touchless interaction.  Professor Quigley, said: ‘Once Soli is deployed in products, our RadarCat solution can revolutionise how people interact with a computer, using everyday objects that can be found in the office or home, for new applications and novel types of interaction.’ He added: ‘Beyond human computer interaction, we can also envisage a wide range of potential applications ranging from navigation and world knowledge to industrial or laboratory process control.’  Read more: RadarCat: Radar Categorization for Input & Interaction using Soli [UIST2016] - YouTube 2016 | New technology using radar can identify materials and objects in real time | University of St Andrews Share or comment on this article e-mail 18 shares Most watched News videos SNL mocks confident Clinton supporters with Dave Chappelle Havelock resident shocked as he films earthquake hitting NZ Trump supporter spews ignorant racist rant at young woman Adorable boxer dog jumps far better than the John Lewis dog Mother kicks her young child out for voting Trump in school Michael Moore tries to meet with Trump at Trump Tower Clinton makes final appearance at campaign headquarters Nigel Farage avoids questions as he enters Trump Tower Dashcam footage captures moment van swerves before crashing SNL mocks government shutdown with Gravity skit Terryfing video of ground shaking as earthquake hits Christchurch Dogs leaping through grass like antelope will cheer you up Trump says he will 'immediately' deport two to three million...

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant.

The iPad grows up: Apple's iPad Pro The iPad Pro is, for many, a real laptop replacement - and a way to combine work and play in a gadget that will last all day and won't break your back to carry. 'A glimpse into the future of the living room': The new Apple TV Apple says apps are the future of TV, and while its new $149 box does have some issues, its combination of streaming services, games and other apps make it the best way to make your TV smart. The end of wonky wifi: Google's OnHub It's incredibly simple to set up, and we found it tripled the speed of our home wifi connection - but at $199 is expensive..

Image: Linda Moon/Shutterstock In one of the biggest indications of its mobile-first intentions, Google is expected to split its desktop and mobile search indexes soon, with the former to play second fiddle to mobile. As things stand, Google search results on both desktop and mobile are sourced from the same powerful index that decides what results you get when you search ‘Chinese restaurants Dublin’, for example. However, if reports are accurate, that search in a few months’ time on desktop won’t be as up to date as the same search on mobile, as Google’s plans follow market trends and the near month-on-month decline of PC sales globally. A year in the making According to Search Engine Land, Google webmaster trends analyst Gary Illyes confirmed at an event that the company will be going ahead with the splitting of its search indexes into desktop and mobile in the coming months. While it might not so evident at first, in-depth comparisons between search results on desktop and mobile will show that the former is slightly different and not as up to date. Last year, Google revealed at the SMX East event that it was toying with the idea of splitting the search index in two, but now Google and SEO experts will certainly be following developments of the new index prior to its launch. The decision to focus greater attention on mobile would appear to follow the company’s attitude to the platform, having announced last year that its search rankings would favour mobile-optimised sites over ones that are not. How out of date the search index on desktop is, and whether it will have any access to the mobile version remains to be seen, but its effect on how its ranking algorithm on mobile will be considerable. ‘It makes sense’ Currently, Google generates its mobile ranking by extracting data from the desktop version and modifying it for use on mobile but with this new index, it can run its own dedicated algorithm. One company that this change will certainly affect is Yoast, a search optimisation company that is used by many websites to optimise their content for Google searches. Speaking with The Guardian, Yoast founder and CEO Joost de Valk has welcomed the news. “It makes sense to me that they’d have two separate indexes and treat them as equals, but now they’ve got a primary one. That makes sense too, because it’s probably the fastest way for them to grow their index,” he said. “I think, in part, it is about pushing people to change their sites to be responsive, rather than having a separate desktop and mobile site. By saying that their mobile index is more important, it will push people to focus on their mobile sites.” Google on desktop.

Reuters reported on Thursday — the deadline for Google to respond in the case — that the company had received an extension from authorities. The new deadline in the case is November 7, according to the news service. ADVERTISEMENT The extension was given to Google at the company’s request. A European Commission spokesperson told Reuters that the “commission analyzed the reasons for the request and granted an extension allowing Google to fully exercise its rights of defense.” The company is facing charges that it abused its dominant position in the market when it came to its comparison shopping service. Google is also facing two other antitrust cases in Europe, where authorities have aggressively pursued American companies. The deadlines in those cases come later this month. Those cases concern Google’s online advertising deals and its popular Android operating system. American regulators at the Federal Trade Commission have been hesitant to pursue Google for competition violations. In 2013, the agency announced it would not take formal action against the company after an investigation of its search practices. That could be changing. Politico reported in May that the agency was once again examining the company’s role in the search market.   Please enable JavaScript to view the featured perspectives by Versa.

Birdman Beef: Cash Money Records Refused To Release ‘Tha Carter V’ For Free By Nicholas Mojica On 10/14/16 AT 10:56 AM Close Lil Wayne’s highly-anticipated album, “Tha Carter V,” should have been out in 2014 but disagreements with Birdman and the Cash Money Record label have led to Lil Wayne’s album being delayed multiple times. During an interview with the Rap Radar podcast, Lil Wayne’s manager, Cortez Bryant, revealed that Cash Money had the chance to release the album for free. Speaking with Elliott Wilson and B. Dot, Bryant said Weezy never received an advance for the album’s first single, “Believe Me,” but still wanted to move forward with the release of the album. While waiting on the advance, Wayne went on tour with Drake, but following the tour, Cash Money still didn’t give Weezy his advance money. This led to Wayne coming up with an idea to release the album with some help from Google. “This was before streaming really hit. We had a deal cut with Google where they were going to back the album and we were really gonna be able to give ‘Carter V’ away for free, streaming,” said Cortez.  According to Bryant, the deal they had in place with Google was “lucrative” but Birdman and his brother Ronald “Slim” Williams, label co-founder, didn’t understand it.

When I presented it to Slim and Baby, they didn’t get it. They didn’t get streaming. They went to the powers that be, the label was against it because they hadn’t put their hands in the [streaming services’] pockets yet, they had no control over it, and they basically told me we can’t put the album out. And when I had to tell Wayne that, he was like…what? He was like, ‘You can’t stop me, you can’t hold me back, my fans don’t deserve this and I’m about to air it out.'” Although Lil Wayne has released other albums such as the “Free Weezy Album” while waiting for the release of “Tha Carter V,” don’t expect him to take matters into his own hands again. After releasing the “Free Weezy Album” with Jay Z through Tidal, Bryant said he doesn’t want to get hit with another cease-and-desist. As fans wait for the album to release, just know that the album is finished and Wayne says it sounds great. “I popped it in, and I was like, it’s still so much better than everything I’ve ever heard,” Wayne told the New York Times. Cash Money Records had a chance to release Lil Wayne’s “Tha Carter V” for free but passed on it. Pictured: Lil Wayne and Birdman at the 2013 BMI R&B/Hip-Hop Awards in New York City on Aug. 22, 2013.

That’s what some publishers believe after having used Google’s AMP (accelerated mobile pages) and Facebook’s Instant Articles. According to Digiday, AMP now accounts for 10 to 15 percent of publisher search traffic. That’s insane. The main reason? AMP-enabled links are lightning fast, so people use them. Thrillist said AMP provides 15 percent of its search traffic; USA Today said it generated 12 percent of its mobile views; and The Verge put it at about 14 percent. “For AMP to almost immediately climb to this 10 to 15 percent number as a contributor to the overall search pie, as a product goes, it’s almost unprecedented,” Shahzad Abbas, vp of digital media at SEO consulting company Define Media, told Digiday. < Previous Article Next Article > Advertisement Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

This week, the company launched a new fact check feature that will be displayed in expanded news stories, alongside the search engine's existing labels, such as opinion and highly cited. The fact check feature works like this: Google will use its Claim Review process to algorithmically determine whether a story might contain factual problems and highlighting sources that have been shown to "follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks," according to its announcement. It's unclear just how many sites will meet this criteria, but the Duke Reporter's Lab has found that "rigorous fact checks are now conducted by more than 100 active sites," Google wrote in its announcement. According to Engadget, that number has grown from just four such organizations in 2010. Google announced Thursday the fact check feature is available for its U.S. and U.K. users of its Google News website and mobile apps for Android and iOS, implying it will hit other markets in the future. "We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community," wrote Richard Gingras, Google's head of news, "and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin."

The consortium plans to make the OpenCAPI specification available to the public before the end of the year and expects servers and related products based on the new standard in the second half of 2017, it said in a statement. Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, is known to protect its server technologies and has chosen to sit out of the new consortium. In the past also, it had stayed away from prominent open standards technology groups such as CCIX and Gen-Z. “As artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced analytics become the price of doing business in today’s digital era, huge volumes of data are now the norm,” Doug Balog, general manager for IBM Power, told Reuters. “It’s clear that today’s datacenters can no longer rely on one company alone to drive innovation,” Balog said.

The move, announced Thursday, will allow readers on Google news applications and websites to click on links to check facts where claims have been evaluated by fact-check organizations. The new feature is being introduced amid a war over facts between many major media outlets and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Google News "determines whether an article might contain fact checks" using an algorithm that evaluates claims and by seeking websites "that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks" ©Leon Neal (AFP/File) It also aims to stem the spread of "fake" news that may spread through social media. "We're excited to see the growth of the fact-check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin," Google news chief Richard Gingras said in a blog post. Google News "determines whether an article might contain fact checks" using an algorithm that evaluates claims and by seeking websites "that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks," the statement said. Bill Adair, a Duke University journalism professor and founder of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact, called the Google announcement "a huge step for fact-checking." Trump has forced fact-checkers to work overtime with a seemingly relentless stream of untruths and exaggerations about his past, and he has hit back at the media for damning revelations. On Thursday, Trump savaged US media for reporting "outright lies" that he groped and forcibly kissed women who came forward to tell their stories to news outlets.

Desktop Google searches could soon feel slightly out of touch compared to those done via smartphones as the company begins to push mobile search. Google has said it is fully splitting its search index into two versions: a rapid updated mobile one, and a secondary search index for the desktop web. SearchEngineLand reports: The news came today during a keynote address from Gary Illyes, a webmaster trends analyst with Google, at Pubcon. Illyes didn't give a timeline in his talk, but in a follow-up with Search Engine Land, he confirmed that it would happen within "months." Google first announced that it was experimenting with the idea of a mobile index last year at SMX East. Since that time, Google's clearly decided that a mobile index makes sense and is moving ahead with the idea. It's unclear exactly how the mobile index will work. For example, since the mobile index is the "primary" index, will it really not be used for any desktop queries? Will it only contain "mobile-friendly" content? How out-of-date will the desktop index be? Desktop usage is now a minority of Google queries but still generates substantial usage. The most substantial change will likely be that by having a mobile index, Google can run its ranking algorithm in a different fashion across "pure" mobile content rather than the current system that extracts data from desktop content to determine mobile rankings. google mobile search ← You may like to read: → DHS Warns of Mirai Botnet Threat To Cellular Modems Israel Meets With Google and YouTube To Discuss Censoring Videos Japanese Court Demands 'Right To Be Forgotten' For Sex Offender The Rise and Fall of the Gopher Protocol Publisher Is Pretty Sure Google Could End Piracy Censorware Failure: Kiddle's "Child-Safe" Search Engine OpenCAPI: Google and IBM Lead Tech Consortium To Speed Data Centre Performance This discussion has been archived.

Users won't get "pushed" in any direction that isn't set up as the default anyway, because we all know that users are too damn lazy to put forth an effort otherwise. Spoof the browser? Yeah right.

"Don't be evil Google"?... I read this in the current issue of World Jewish Congress (WJC) digest and pass it along to you: "The World Jewish Congress called it 'scandalous' that the world's largest Internet company, Google Inc ., is failing to remove thousands of neo-Nazi hate videos from its video platform YouTube. An investigative report broadcast on German television found that many video clips which incite violence against Jews, Muslims, Blacks and refugees remain easily accessible on YouTube. WJC CEO and Executive Vice President ROBERT SINGER said: Google's company motto is 'Don't be evil'. But it becomes increasingly apparent that Google has no problem with allowing evil to spread on its YouTube platform. Google likes to give lofty assurances that hateful and racist content has no place on YouTube, yet it is quite obvious that they don't act to keep such content off their platforms. Google has been put on notice many times, and it has known about the extent of the problem for years. By failing to act, it is helping in the proliferation of racist and anti-Semitic propaganda on the internet. We therefore urge them: Don't be evil, don't abet evil-act against evil. In April, the WJC sent a letter to Google Germany asking the company to remove songs of the German neo-Nazi band Kommando Freisler. While 11 clips were deleted by YouTube, thousands of other versions continue to be available on the service. Remembering Jewish history... In September of 1941 at Babi Yar, a ravine on the outskirts of Kiev, Nazi "Einsatzgruppen" , mobile killing squads shot and buried nearly 34,000 Jews in a two-day period. In August 1943, with the Red Army advancing, the Nazis dug up the bodies from the mass graves of Baby Yar and burned them in an attempt to remove the evidence of mass murder. Today, Babi Yar has come to symbolize the horrific murder of Jews as well as the persistent failure of the world to acknowledge this Jewish tragedy. A Jewish Pavilion Mensch... I received the following email from the Jewish Pavilion: "LISA LEVIN is a wonderful mensch. (See photo above of Lisa and her mother, MARILYN LEVINE.) Lisa's mother moved to Orlando to live near Lisa. Soon after Marilyn settled in at Oakmonte Village, Lisa became involved by volunteering at bi-weekly Shabbat services. With great appreciation to Lisa for her dedication to the Jewish Pavilion and to 40 or more of her mother's neighbors and friends, she is very valuable as a volunteer. While Lisa feels helpful and enjoys getting to know her mom's friends, Marilyn feels proud showing off her daughter who is truly a wonderful and kind woman." And speaking of the Jewish Pavilion... On Sunday, Oct, 23 at 2 p.m ., the Jewish Pavilion will hold "Sunday in the Park," a fall festival at Cranes Roost Park in Altamonte Springs. There will be food and beverages, entertainment and prizes! Featured will be "The British Invasion," the Beatles Tribute Band. You are welcome to bring your friends. If you purchase 12 tickets you will receive 2 free! The cost of a ticket prior to Oct. 20th is $20. It will be $25 at the event. Proceeds enhance the lives of our elders.

Leisure Home LBoard Hadi: Rejecting PH not equal to supporting Umno Adam Abu Bakar Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Google adds fact-checking to news articles AFP | October 14, 2016 Google News "determines whether an article might contain fact checks" using an algorithm that evaluates claims and by seeking websites "that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks," the statement said. WASHINGTON: Google is adding “fact check” tags to its news articles, introducing the feature amid a US presidential race roiled by heated disputes over the accuracy of information. The move, announced Thursday, will allow readers on Google news applications and websites to click on links to check facts where claims have been evaluated by fact-check organizations. The new feature is being introduced amid a war over facts between many major media outlets and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. It also aims to stem the spread of “fake” news that may spread through social media. “We’re excited to see the growth of the fact-check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Google news chief Richard Gingras said in a blog post. Google News “determines whether an article might contain fact checks” using an algorithm that evaluates claims and by seeking websites “that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks,” the statement said. Bill Adair, a Duke University journalism professor and founder of the Pulitzer Prize-winning site PolitiFact, called the Google announcement “a huge step for fact-checking.” Trump has forced fact-checkers to work overtime with a seemingly relentless stream of untruths and exaggerations about his past, and he has hit back at the media for damning revelations. On Thursday, Trump savaged US media for reporting “outright lies” that he groped and forcibly kissed women who came forward to tell their stories to news outlets.

Screenshot Those who clicked on the message were directed to Google’s voter registration guide (available in English and Spanish), which provided a link to the state DMV website, where people can register using their driver’s license, permit, or non-driver ID. The DMV automatically forwards the registration form to the resident’s board of elections—they can check the New York State voter registration search engine to ensure their form was received. The Google service also includes step by step instructions for citizens who want to register in person or by mail—this process must also be completed today. Any New Yorker who wants to vote must be a U.S. citizen who will be at least 18 years old on Election Day, November 8, and who resides in New York as of October 9. Prospective voters cannot be in prison or on parole for a felony conviction, be declared mentally incompetent by a court or claim the right to vote in another state. Do you meet the requirements? Screenshot Once they’ve completed the voter registration procedure, New Yorkers can get information about Election Day itself—polls will be open from 6 AM to 9 PM throughout the state (though anyone who requires an absentee ballot will need to submit an application by November 1, and mail their completed ballot so it’s postmarked by November 7). Anyone voting in person for the first time may need to show some form of ID (driver’s license, state ID, utility bill, bank statement or paycheck, among others). Voters can also search their street address to find their polling place and see their full ballot. If you live in the other 49 states, never fear—the New York page includes a dropdown menu where you can search for your state’s specific voter registration requirements as well. Facebook held a similar voter registration drive last month, which led to over 120,000 Californians registering to vote on a single day.

The ability to fact check the news in real time has been something of a problem for politicians making outlandish claims at debates; so much so, that US presidential nominee Hillary Clinton runs her own fact-checking page about her rival Donald Trump. The same goes for Google News, one of the largest news aggregators online, that will now try to shine a light through the fog of misleading headlines using its tagging system. Much like when it identifies an opinion piece or a highly cited source, stories that feature in-depth or quick fact checks of claims made by organisations or politicians will have their own ‘Fact Check’ label. In a blog post, Google’s head of news Richard Gingras said that Google News now determines whether an article might contain fact checks in part by looking for the schema.org ClaimReview markup. Google News also looks for sites that follow the commonly accepted criteria for fact checks. There are a few criteria that Google lists for publishers to follow in order to get their fact-checking content listed on Google News. An example of Fact Check in action. Image: Google Rocky relationship Discrete claims and checks must be easily identified in the body of fact-check articles for readers to understand what was checked, and what conclusions were reached. In the case of Hillary Clinton running her own fact-checking page, it would not be eligible to be listed under the fact check tag as it must be nonpartisan, with transparent funding and affiliations. It isn’t widespread just yet, with the UK and US the first countries to try it, but Google plans to roll out the tag to other countries in the coming months. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Gingras said. Major tech companies and news have not had a steady relationship of late, particularly Facebook, who took steps to firing its human news aggregators over claims that it demoted conservative news in its Trending section.

SUBSCRIBE Google Panda demotes or adjusts your rankings down — it does not devalue Gary Illyes from Google told us Google's new Penguin 4.0 algorithm devalues spam, ignores it -- but Panda demotes the spam by adjusting the rankings down. Barry Schwartz on October 14, 2016 at 9:38 am More In part two of our interview with Gary Illyes of Google, Gary told us that the Google Panda algorithm demotes, or adjusts a site’s ranking down; it does not devalue or ignore the spam, like Penguin 4.0 does. Gary told us in the interview, when we asked about Panda devaluing versus demoting, “[S]o essentially, if you want a blunt answer, it will not devalue, it will actually demote.” As you may remember, Penguin 4.0 now devalues links by ignoring them, as opposed to demoting or penalizing the links. But that is not how Panda works. Gary said “… it is an adjustment. Basically, we figured that site is trying to game our systems, and unfortunately, successfully. So we will adjust the rank. We will push the site back just to make sure that it’s not working anymore.” Here is the audio snippet: Here is the transcript: Barry Schwartz: Well, since you brought up Panda, and I know I asked you this on Twitter, you didn’t give us a direct answer to it. … I asked specifically, does Panda devalue or demote or both. And you kind of implied it demotes. But can you like tell us straight up? Gary Illyes: Well, Panda is not a penalty. … Yeah, maybe in the beginning it was thought of as a penalty, but currently we don’t. … But we don’t think of Panda as a penalty now, but rather as an algorithm applied to sites … or sites as a whole. It measures the quality of a site pretty much by looking at the vast majority of the pages at least. But essentially allows us to take quality of the whole site into account when ranking pages from that particular site and adjust the ranking accordingly for the pages. So essentially, if you want a blunt answer, it will not devalue, it will actually demote. Barry Schwartz: OK, but it won’t promote it? Gary Illyes: No, I don’t think that [it] has the ability to promote. Barry Schwartz: And it’s looking at specific pages on the site, gathering all the pages across the side and saying based on all of these pages that we looked at for this site, 80 percent of them are pretty poor quality, thus we might go ahead and apply a Panda demotion of some sorts. Gary Illyes: Well, it is an adjustment. Basically, we figured that site is trying to game our systems, and unfortunately, successfully. So we will adjust the rank. We will push the site back just to make sure that it’s not working anymore.

We’re using robots for subsea exploration, interplanetary explorations, for expanding our nuclear industry. It’s no surprise if they’re able to do everything at some point in the future. In fact, the robotic revolution has got to a point where we’re seeing applications in new industries. Take for example, the construction industry which is using construction robots to make work more efficient. Big architects like Bjarke Ingels, Wolf D Prix, claim construction robots are the future of the construction industry. In 2016, we’ve seen increased use of robots in industries like construction. More companies are now using robots to do repetitive tasks on construction sites and to make human jobs safer. An Army of Construction Robots Will Build Google Headquarters Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick are using robot-crane hybrids to build Google’s proposed California headquarters. Also known as ‘crabots,’ these machines will be used to build most of its internal structures. IMAGE: Google North Bayshore According to the planning reports, the crabots are a “range of small flexible manageable cranes and robotic machines”. The Google crabots will move freely across the entire site to establish a “hackable system for the building of the interior structures”. They are in use to lift and move prefabricated materials, elements of furniture and services. The prefabricated materials are essential to the designers’ proposal for creating a hackable workplace system. The materials used will be lightweight and mobile structures instead of permanent concrete buildings. All things considered, the usage of crabots to build a hackable (customizable) system will allow easy and affordable reconfiguration of space throughout the building over the years. Using Robots to Plot the Course A San Francisco-based drone startup, Skycatch, is using drones on high-profile building projects. These drones are help get a bird’s-eye view of the construction site and receive progress reports. Additionally, the drones are used to speed up the logistics of the construction by monitoring deliveries. Similarly, a Japanese construction machinery giant Komatsu, is using Skycatch drones to provide the eyes for automated bulldozers. These drones send 3D models of a building site to a computer which then feeds the images to unmanned machinery to navigate. Last year, Australia’s Fastbrick Robotics shared a video of a bricklaying robot which can place 1,000 bricks an hour based on a CAD drawing. The construction robot can finish the shell of a new hour every two to three days, complete with plumbing and electrical. Robots have evolved to a point where they don’t need reconfiguration, they can adapt on their own. In a complicated industry like construction, the use of robots will make building sites less hazardous. They’ll even change the roles played by humans by taking over repetitive, time-consuming tasks. Although, this doesn’t mean that human construction workers will become redundant. Author Anna Domanska Follow Anna Domanska on Twitter, Facebook & Google.

Google News Rolls Out New Fact-Check Tag International Business Times 14/10/2016 Mary Pascaline © Provided by IBT US Google added a new “fact-check” tag to its Google News service Thursday. The tag will now appear among news search results with the service’s existing labels like opinion, local source and highly cited. Google News’ algorithm will use ClaimReview from schema.org to connect fact-checking stories to live news articles. Readers in the U.S. and U.K. can find facts in the expanded view of the articles on the web and mobile versions of Google News. “We’re excited to see the growth of the Fact Check community and to shine a light on its efforts to divine fact from fiction, wisdom from spin,” Google said in a blogpost. The service, which aggregates news stories, has rolled out the new fact-checking label less than a month before the U.S. goes to polls on Nov. 8. The tense presidential race has seen several instances where fact and fiction collide. Both nominees have been accused of misrepresenting facts. Google said in its blogpost that websites that meet the commonly accepted criteria for a fact-checking service can apply to have their service included. “If we find sites not following those criteria for the ClaimReview markup, we may, at our discretion, either ignore that site's markup or remove the site from Google News,” the service’s support page warned. The new label is currently available only for users based in the U.K. and the U.S. Go to MSN Home More in News Hunt for prisoners ‘at risk to public’ after they flee jail Mirror Second tremor hits NZ hours after deadly quake kills two Mirror NHS plans involving hospital closures 'kept secret from public' Press Association Theresa May sets out stall for UK's place in Trump’s world The Guardian Diabetic grandmother dies after Chinese 'slap treatment' The Telegraph London-bound flight forced to land after stork-hit Evening Standard Up Next May under growing Cabinet pressure to exploit Farage's links with Trump International Business Times More in News IVF mum marries donor after tracking him down and falling in love Mirror Tracking an elusive diary from Hitler's inner circle The New York Times £1bn Madonna becomes highest-grossing solo touring artist ever Evening Standard AdChoices AdChoices More from International Business Times Paris attacks and the rise of the French right-wing International Business Times SwiftKey for Android has a new update International Business Times Apple to launch 3 iPads in March 2017 International Business Times Nintendo finally confirms end of Wii U International Business Times International Business Times View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sport Money Lifestyle Horoscopes Health & Fitness Food & Drink Cars Travel Dating © 2016 Microsoft Privacy & Cookies Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Anti-Spam Newsletter

Simon Robb for Metro.co.ukFriday 14 Oct 2016 2:21 pm Mary Jane Seacole has been honoured by Google (Picture: Getty Images) Pioneering black nurse Mary Seacole has been honoured today with a Google doodle – but who is she? And why is she revered? In defence of studying Art History – the only truly liberal arts subject For starters, she was voted the most important black Briton in history. You may have heard of Florence Nightingale, who is considered the founder of modern nursing for her work during the Crimean War in the 1850s. Well, Mary Seacole was forgotten for almost a century, despite serving as a nurse in the same war and setting up her own ‘hotel’ to help the wounded. Where was she born? She was the daughter of a Scot who served in the British Army (Picture: Getty Images) She was born in Jamaica in 1805 to a Scottish soldier father who served in the British Army. Her mother was known as a healer (doctress) who used traditional Caribbean and African herbal remedies for the sick. Growing up she learnt all her nursing skills from her mother who ran a boarding house. What did she do in the Crimean War? She travelled to the war-torn region of Crimea by herself and set up a ‘British Hotel’ for injured soldiers in the town of Balaclava. This is what a million pumpkins looks like The hotel was built from driftwood, packing cases, iron sheets and other salvaged items like glass doors. She sold everything from handkerchiefs to champagne, as well as dispensing people’s medication. Was she famous at the time? Her work in the Crimea is often overshadowed by her contemporary Florence Nightingale (Picture: Getty Images) Yes. Many people knew who she was and her work was written about in a number of British newspapers. She was even acknowledged by Florence herself, who she met once in Scutari, Turkey. Speaking about Florence, Seacole said: ‘You must know… that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.’ Did racism hold back her memory? It is argued that the main reason Seacole’s memory had faded was down to her race. Historians believe her landmark achievements remained hidden for so long due to racial attitudes in the 19th century. Novelist, Salman Rushdie referred to Seacole as an example of ‘hidden’ black history. He wrote: ‘See, here is Mary Seacole, who did as much in the Crimea as another magic-lamping lady, but, being dark, could scarce be seen for the flame of Florence’s candle.’ How do we remember her now? Google have honoured her with a doodle (Picture: Google) In 2004, Seacole was ranked the greatest black Briton ever in an online poll. Mum creates brilliant kid-friendly video that explains consent in a way everyone can understand She is also one of few black women that have been honoured with an English Heritage blue plaque. In June, a statue of the nursing heroine was unveiled outside St Thomas’ Hospital in London, a place that is also associated with Nightingale. And not forgetting today’s Google doodle, of course.
