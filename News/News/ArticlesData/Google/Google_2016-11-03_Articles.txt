While RCS and SMS will be compatible in some ways, the former standard will allow for iMessage-like features like file transfers, audio messaging, video sharing, conference calling, location sharing and live sketching. Well, it won’t be anywhere near as amazing as Invisible Ink or lasers, but as applied to an interoperable standard, we’ll take it. Over 150 devices on the market currently are capable are supporting the RCS. 58 carriers worldwide will be on the launch pad — in the US, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile have signed onto the new standard. Here’s where the fragmentation begins, though: Google has decided to offer its own cloud servers for RCS — a service it brands as Jibe — and has been able to recruit Sprint to use them to launch its service. Starting next year, all Android phones on the network will come pre-loaded with Google’s Messenger app “as the default SMS and RCS messaging experience.” Some LG and Nexus phones will support RCS chat right now with a Messenger update, now in distribution. Google has been pushing Jibe hard to other carriers and is expecting to nail more deals down soon — the big G gets money from carriers while the carriers don’t have to worry about maintaining their own servers as they’ve done with SMS. In terms of the competitive scene, security and privacy, that’s a ball of yarn within itself. Of course, this drags Mountain View’s approach to messaging on Android into focus as we see Google’s Messenger become just a little more like iMessage and Facebook Messenger just by being a default. Allo, which has the quickest potential to provide way more advanced messaging features in combination with access to service bots like Google Assistant, is arguably trying to cannibalize users from “the default.” And Hangouts? Well, it’s a hot enterprise mess that’s still trying to figure out where to go now. As The Verge‘s Dieter Bohn describes the situation, Messenger is more a play for carriers while Google is attempting to keep itself in the consumer convenience market with Allo. At this point, we doubt consumers are noticing a difference between the two that will make them switch in droves. Advertisement likethis What's your reaction?

I extract items for the Wrap from my link blog, which you’re welcome to follow. To make sure you never miss an issue, subscribe to my weekly email briefing. News Look out Slack. Microsoft unleashes Teams—Microsoft has announced its Slack killer, Microsoft Teams. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls it a “chat-based workspace” within Office 365, designed to bring teams together for conversation and collaboration. It also unifies Office apps like Word and Powerpoint, Skype, and other Microsoft tools in a single piece of software that work on a variety of devices. Teams also has threaded conversations, something Slack lacks. Slack has bots; so does Teams, and they’re based on Microsoft’s Bot Framework. The takeaway: By most accounts, Slack’s leaders should be very worried. Read more Need evidence that Slack is worried?—In response to Microsoft’s launch of Microsoft Teams, Slack bought a full-page ad in the New York Times that welcomed its competitor to the enterprise messaging space and offering some “friendly advice.” The takeaway: The open letter seems panicky to me and (as the TNW article points out, it seems Slack didn’t see Teams coming). Slack should also be worried about Facebook Workplace. If you think an independent company that cornered the early market is sure to maintain its hold just by being first, I have one word for you: Meerkat. Read more But should Slack be worried?—According to ZDNet’s Ed Bott, there’s a huge difference between Microsoft Teams and Slack despite superficial similarities. Slack, he says, is a product while Teams is a Feature of Office 365, which also includes email, Skype, Office apps, and a terabyte of OneDrive for Business storage. Another difference: Slack enables contractors and other outsiders to participate in a team (without paying for a license for outside collaborators).  The takeaway: Bott believes the markets for Slack and Teams are different. That sounds right, for the most part; smaller companies using Slack as a collaboration tool may not have the need to pay more for a suite of tools they don’t really need. On the other hand, all those companies using Slack and Office 365 may just dump Slack in favor of the integrated suite of tools they’re already paying for that now includes a collaboration package. Read more The perils of election-themed marketing—Starbucks no doubt thought it was creating a campaign that would resonate with everyone on both sides of the American political spectrum. But its green “unity” cup has provoked harsh responses, ranging from accusations of “political brainwashing” and “spreading liberal bias” to threats of a boycott. Starbucks always comes out with a seasonal cup as the holidays approach, and some are upset this one isn’t more overtly Christmas-themed. According to CEO Howard Schultz, the cup was designed as “a reminder of our shared values and the need to be good to each other.” The takeaway: Even if you think your message is noble and appealing to everyone, a divisive political season is bound to produce negative reactions to anything with an election theme. Steer clear. Read more New YouTube creator tools aim to make it more social—YouTube has introduced new features designed to improve the ease with which creators can build community and recognize their most ardent fans. Creators can “pin” comments to the top of a thread and a comment from the channel owner gets special visual treatment to make it stand out. Creators can also “heart” comments from fans. The takeaway: Anything to improve the cesspool of YouTube comments is welcome, but i especially like giving more control of the community to the channel owner/creator. Businesses that have used YouTube as storage for videos can think about nurturing a fan base. Read more Live video streaming comes to Kickstarter—Using Facebook Live, Twitter Periscope, or YouTube Live, brands and individuals can live-stream video to anybody about anything. The strength of live-streaming is getting a boost, though, from Kickstarter, which is a more focused venture. Kickstarter Live lets backers and creators interact via live-streaming video. Early testers of the service used it for everything from live product demonstrations to cooking classes. According to TNW, “If potential backers can see a product being used in real-time, they may be more confident that they’ll actually get something for their money.” The intimacy of real-time video can also strengthen the connection between creators and backers. The takeaway: Every company will soon need to assess whether real-time video has a place not just in their strategies for Facebook, Twitter, and the like, but even on their owned properties. Read more Vine founders release live video app—Like we need another one? Hype is an iOS-only app (so far) from the founders of Vine (those guys whom Twitter didn’t bother to notify they were shutting down) that will go head-to-head with Twitter’s Periscope (not to mention Facebook Live). It’s not just another clone, though. Hype lets users “share a variety of multimedia content into the live broadcast—so, for example, a streamer using Hype can include cameras or videos from their device’s camera roll, blending their live content with stuff they made earlier.” They can also add music and emojis, and they can use video as the background for their video. The takeaway: The features sound nifty, but building audiences that already exist for Periscope (on Twitter) and Facebook Live (on Facebook) will be hard. I expect to see some brands try it out as a way to offer more visually rich broadcasts. ReEad more MasterCard releases Blockchain APIs—Blockchain is complex and extremely geeky, but here’s the thing: You WILL be communicating to your stakeholders about how it is changing your company’s or client’s business, so you might as well get up to speed. The impact of blockchain will be similar to the impact of the Internet: world-changing. By way of evidence, consider the both MasterCard and Visa are getting involved. Visa has released a B2B blockchain of its own, while MasterCard has developed a set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) designed to as experiments for interact with its own internal blockchain to enter into smart contracts and settle payments. The company says more is to come. The takeaway: Go ahead. Unsubscribe from this newsletter because you think blockchain is so far outside the scope of PR and marketing that I’m just being ridiculous. But when blockchain rocks your world in a year or two (okay, maybe three), I want you to let me know so I can say I told you so. Read more Trends Brands ride Cubs’ coattails—I’m shocked—shocked, I tell you—to find that brands were quick to send out marketing messages when the Chicago Cubs won their first World Series in 108 years. Some had a connection to the news, like Nike. A bunch of Chicago-based companies (United, Allstate, Motorola) had legitimate connections to the team. For other brands, though, it was one more example of why real-time marketing is quickly running its course. The takeaway: Will anybody decide to shop at Staples because they tweeted out a W formed from paper clips? Or ride the Long Island Railroad because they shared a picture of a train from 1908? If there’s a connection, fine, I suppose, go ahead and offer up congratulations. If not, your time is better spent on efforts that might convert to sales or leads. Confine your real-time efforts to public affairs issues. Read more Google’s app store is getting a makeover—The overhaul of the Google Play store is noteworthy because of the rationale: It will accommodate Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, mobile payment options, and wearable devices. The takeaway: A more cohesive and comprehensive apps store will make it easier for Android users to find and install what they need to take advantage of newer and emerging smartphone capabilities. It should also serve as a warning to communicators and marketers that these capabilities are quickly becoming mainstream. Read more Yogurt company gets customer support for employing refugees—I have been reporting here for years the research that reinforces the importance of companies standing up for societal causes. Chobani founder Hamdi Ulukaya was receiving death threats for his efforts to hire refugees for his upstate New York factory. Right-wing websites have called for boycotts. But customers are rallying to demonstrate support for Ulukaya. Brandwatch ran its sentiment analysis software and found mostly positive references, while some of the negative messages were intentionally crafted to drown out the truly hateful posts. The brand’s hashtags, such as #RefugeesWelcomne and #BuyChobani—have been trending. The issue could even be translating into sales increases (at least for the short term). The takeaway: The Edelman Trust Barometer makes it clear that customers don’t want companies to sit on the sidelines; they want companies to use their clout to affect social change. It’s personal for Ulukaya, an immigrant himself, and though he has been criticized for being too public with his views, it’s clear his customers appreciate his efforts. Last week I reported on a study that correlated Chobani-like behavior with improved sales. The Chobani case study seems to bear that out. Read more Native advertising’s star continues to rise—Native advertising will make up 25% of advertising revenues for news media companies by 2018, more than doubling the 11% it accounts for now. The Native Advertising Institute and the International news Media Association surveyed 156 publishers worldwide to arrive at the figure. The study also found that 48% of newspaper media are selling native ad space and 39% more plan to make their space available for native ads. The takeaway: In the PESO model—paid/earned/social/owned—communicators in every discipline should explore the potential of native advertising as a means of expanding reach to the right audiences and building credibility. Be sure to explore the variety of types of native advertising to select those that will best suit your strategy. Read more One class of native ads may be fading—You see them at the end of articles on all kinds of sites, lists of articles from around the web you may be interested in. They often have little in common with the story you just read or your interests. But they’re a cheap way for advertisers to reach large audiences for not so much money. Some publishers, though, are worried that these ads are turning off readers (especially when they take readers to dodgy websites), leading Slate and The New Yorker, among others, to remove them. Others could soon follow. The takeaway: The industry has a small window of time to get native advertising right, and these “promoted stories” widgets from companies like Outbrain are failing miserably. It didn’t have to be this way. Sharing truly relevant content would have made this category of native advertising desirable rather than a liability. Read more Research Data is the new influencer—The power of data to influence the public is growing, according to the first-ever public opinion poll about public attitudes, knowledge, and behavior about data. The study, From Hill+Knowlton Strategies and Research+Data Insights finds that only a third of the public understands data even though most trust it. According to the study, 80% of the public want data to help them identify news sources to trust, 60% want it to help them figure out where to live, and 49% think it can help them pick the right candidate to support in an election. Eighty-eight percent say claims are more persuasive if they’re backed up by data. Among the 36% of Americans who are data-literate, only 6% are data-savvy. These are part of a new class of “data influencers,” having an impact on the attitudes and actions of those around them. The takeaway: Using data to support claims is becoming more important, but equally important is helping educate the public about data in general—kind of like the balancing act marketers are going to have to play with Artificial Intelligence. Read more The truth about the Dark Web—Watch cyberthrillers and you can be excused for thinking the Dark Web is populated with child porn, drug dealers, and all manner of other illicit and criminal activity. The truth is, according to research from Terbium Labs, more than half of what occupies the Dark Web is perfectly legal. The Dark Web isn’t searchable by Google or other indexers and can’t be accessed with a normal Web browser; rather, you need to use the privacy-protecting browser Tor. According to the study’s authors, “Anonymity does not equate criminality, merely a desire for privacy. The takeaway: Among those using Tor are journalists, human-rights advocates, and political dissidents. Increasingly, companies will also have to account for the desire among many of their stakeholders for privacy. Read more Artificial Intelligence and Chatbots CNN Kik bot will keep young users updated on election night—Kik was the first messaging app to offer a centralized place to find chatbots and CNN wants to tap the app’s 13-to-17-year-old user base. The cable news network’s Kik bot will deliver real-time election results along with custom Clinton and Trump emojis, GIFs, smilies, and stickers featuring CNN talent including Anderson Cooper. The takeaway: The 13-to-17 set doesn’t sit in front of a TV watching news, but CNN wants to be their source anyway and sees a bot as a means to make that happen. It’s a strategy worth watching and, if that demographic is important to you, emulating. Read more Yahoo aggregates its bots—Yep, Yahoo is still around and making some interesting moves as it awaits approval of its acquisition by Verizon. Among them: an app called Yahoo Bots for iOS and Android that serves as a central collection of its various virtual assistants, including Yahoo news, Yahoo Weather, Yahoo Finance, and Blitz (for fantasy football players). More could be added soon. The takeaway: Making it easier to find bots will accelerate their adoption. Microsoft is already launching a bot search engine. Read more Case studies of marketers using AI are all about brand experience—Feel like a bowl of soup? Specifically, Campbell Soup? You can ask IBM’s Watson for recipes based on the weather where you live, the kinds of flavors you like, and even what groceries are in your fridge and pantry. Sesame Street is employing Watson to produce personalized learning for children. USAA customers can ask an AI-imbued personal assistant called Eva who, for now, can help navigate information but down the road will review and analyze customers’ financial information and make money management recommendations. BMW’s opt-in AI learns about you to help you navigate around traffic, find your parked car, or give you walking directions once you park. The takeaway: Last week I shared a survey of CMOs that found most believe AI will have a greater impact on marketing and communications than social media. These examples should help cement that idea for you. AI is, without question, the biggest thing on the communications horizon. Read more Twitter enters the bot fray—Twitter is introducing bots companies can use to automate customer service inquiries. The bots will interact within the Direct Message part of Twitter to deliver automated welcome messages and quick replies to basic questions. “Quick replies let businesses prompt people with the ways to reply to a DM, whether by choosing from a list of options or prompting users to enter specific text values,” according to C|Net. The takeaway: Bots represent a technology with clear communication implications. With Microsoft and Facebook among those developing platforms for bot development, and now Twitter offering some basic bot functionality for brands, communicators should explore where bots will play a role in everything from media and investor relations to internal communications. Read more IBM’s Watson now part of Staples mobile ordering—Mobile is a big part of the future of commerce, but it’s still often cumbersome. Office supply retailer Staples thinks AI can make it easier. By employing IBM’s Watson, customers will be able to “order anytime, anywhere, from any device they prefer, including by text message.” Watson will be able to answer questions and initiate actions like returns. Customers will also be able to speak their order into the phone, which Watson will process. The takeaway: AI will soon be at the heart of all such transactional processes, which will be as easy as Captain Kirk saying, “Computer…” Read more New chatbots let marketers analyze campaigns—Among the variety of chatbots flooding the market, four are designed to help marketers monitor, analyze, and (in some cases) manage campaigns from within messaging apps like Slack and Facebook Messenger. Simple natural-language queries will allow marketers to conduct their analysis from within messaging without needing to log into the advertising platform. The takeaway: If you think of this category of chatbots as “virtual assistants,” you can start to see the possibility for the vast array of different tasks they can help you accomplish more easily than was possible before. Read more Microsoft introduces Concept Graph to aid AI learning—Artificial Intelligence enables tools like Siri and Amazon’s Echo to understand an inquiry regardless of how it is phrased. To aid AI in understanding what people mean, Microsoft has released Concept Graph, a database of words connected to concepts. Here’s the idea: People have an advantage over machines in that we already understand a broad range of concepts (e.g., dates, people, objects). We’re able to conceptualize the idea, say, that a hamburger is food or a shirt is apparel. The Concept Graph is designed to help machines understand sentences by providing them with “common-sense computing capabilities.” The database contains 5.4 million concepts. Concept Graph competes with Google’s Knowledge Graph, which contains 70 billion facts. The takeaway: Tools to aid in machine learning are being introduced at a steady clip, signaling a big imminent leap in AI’s functionality. Read more Virtual and Augmented Reality A VR e-commerce experience with no headset required—Wrap your mind around this, if you can. Hormel wants you to buy bacon in an immersive VR environment that require neither an app nor a headset. Just visit the site and you can hold the phone up to your eyes for a semi-immersive experience. It works better with a Cardboard headset; Hormel is even distributing a limited number of bacon-scented headsets. To make an actual purchase, you’ll just use your eyes to complete the transaction. The takeaway: I tried it on my laptop, which left something to be desired. When I get back to my office, I’ll pop my phone into my Cardboard goggles and see if it’s better. But admit it: You’re intrigued. And as for VR E-Commerce, expect to hear more about this concept. Read more Conde Nast tests print-based AR—Conde Nast is the first brand to try HTC’s Vivepaper, a QR-like code printed on paper that triggers a VR headset to display virtual content on top of the paper. A camera built into HTC’s Vive headset sees and tracks your interaction with the page. The concept isn’t new. Companies like Metaio (recently acquired by Apple) did something similar with your phone: Open the app, scan the code on the printed page, and the page came to life with video, extended content, and more. With HTC’s technology, though, you are immersed in a virtual world that includes a slice of the real world: the document you’re holding. Vivepaper will also work for Android and iOS owners using mobile VR headsets like Cardboard. The takeaway: The potential is huge but I wonder how many people are going to scramble to get their headsets to take advantage of it. While some believe we’ll eventually all wear normal-sized glasses that deliver AR, VR, and Mixed Reality, I remain skeptical. These technologies will be big, but people will use them when they decide to take the time, not whenever they happen to see a code on a printed page. At most, they’ll put the publication aside for later and, if they remember, will try it out later. Or not. Read more Mobile and Wearables Most Internet access is mobile—It’s official. Mobile devices—smartphones and tablets—access the Internet more than desktops and laptops. StatCounter Global Stats said mobile devices accounted for 51.3% of global Internet usage in October vs. 48.7% for laptops and desktops. The takeaway: This should come as no surprise. We have clearly been headed down this road. But if you needed convincing before, this ought to do the trick. We are rapidly headed to a mobile-dominant communication and productivity environment. Your communication strategies must account for this irrevocable trend. Read more More Internet use will be mobile next year—Fifty-one percent is nothing. By next year, 75% of Internet use will be driven by smartphones and tablets. That’s the projection from Zenith, a media buying agency (and a unit of Publicis Groupe SA). By the following year, mobile advertising spending will reach $134 billion (more than will be spent on newspaper, magazine, movie, and outdoor advertising combined). The takeaway: That ad projection is a startling wake-up call. And it doesn’t even account for advertising in VR and AR, which is undoubtedly coming sooner than we may think. Read more Stock Exchange taps Snapchat to attract Millennials—The venerable New York Stock Exchange has found success with Snapchat at reaching Millennials. Banners promoting its account adorn its New York building and has created geofilters around activities. For example, when Yum Brands (which trades on the NYSE) spun off its China assets, the exchange created geofilters covering its own Wall Street building, in Times Square, and at Yum Brands headquarters, where a graphic overlaid videos and images from Taco Bell and Pizza Hut. The NYSE has worked with other companies to create filters for use on the day of their IPOs. Metrics reveal that the strategy has paid off, with huge numbers of people adding the exchange and the brands its content supports as Snapchat contacts. The takeaway: If you want to attract the attention of a younger demographic, you need to use the tools they’re using. They won’t visit your website just because your goal is to drive traffic. And if the 224-year-old financial institution can do it, so can your company.

Apple learned early on that controlling all entire hardware and software was the way to go, but Google seemed content to just work on the software end. Sure, there were a few forgettable Google-branded Nexus phones, but they were far from the best Android handsets. Now Google has decided to dive in head-first and design its own phones, the Google Pixel and Pixel XL. HTC is building the phones, but the design is all Google's. Let's get one thing out of the way first -- Google's Pixel looks like an iPhone. That's not necessarily a bad thing. Apple has sold millions of iPhones, and the design and look are proven hits. But even though it looks like an iPhone and costs the same as the iPhone (starting at $650), there are hardware differences that are worth mentioning. Hardware and specs I've been using the non-XL Pixel for the last few weeks, so my hands-on thoughts will focus on the smaller version. The Pixel is built around a 5-inch AMOLED screen made from Corning Gorilla Glass 4 with a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels (441 pixels per inch). It runs a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor with four gigabytes of RAM and ships with 32gb or 128gb of storage. The sleep/wake button is high on the right edge, but the volume rocker button is also on the right. This put all the buttons comfortably under your thumb (if you're right-handed). The big difference in the Pixel's design is the placement of the fingerprint sensor on the phone's back, which happens to be exactly where my index finger rests when I'm holding the phone. Putting the fingerprint reader on the back isn't really better or worse than the iPhone's front placement -- it's a matter of taste. Because the Pixel chose the back, I have to pick up the phone to unlock it with my finger. I do find I keep my iPhone lying on my desk, so I am able to just touch my finger to the reader without picking up the phone to check a message or text. The body is made of aluminum, but the top third of the phone's backside is also glass. The main camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and an f/2.0 lens. The front camera has an 8-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 lens. The camera is top-notch. The Pixel is on par with Apple's iPhone 7 or Samsung's Galaxy S7 Edge. I can't say enough nice things about the camera on the Pixel. I also love invoking the camera app by a quick double flip of the phone or double tapping the sleep/wake button. Google also includes unlimited cloud storage for all photos and videos taken with the Pixel. The charger is USB-C, which seems to be where the world is headed (except for iPhones). The Pixel's USB-C port uses the faster USB 3.0, which means much faster transfers. According to Google, 15 minutes of USB-C charging from the included 18-watt power supply will provide seven hours of power. The Pixel's physical dimensions are 5.6 inches x 2.7 inches x 0.2 inches, and it weighs 5.04 ounces. It's about a quarter of an inch longer than my iPhone 6s. The 2,770 mAh battery easily lasted a day for my use. You'll find the usual radios -- 802.11ac Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2 along with NFC. There are a few features you won't find on the Pixel, including water resistance and stereo speakers (there's just one). There is no slot for adding storage, and the Pixel does not have wireless charging. Android in all its glory You may have used Android phones before, but you really haven't used Android as Google intended. Different wireless carriers and phone manufacturers put their own software on top of Android, often cluttering up the landscape. The Pixel runs pure, unadulterated Android 7.1, and it's the only phone to feature Google's new Assistant. Simply say "OK, Google," and you'll invoke the Google Assistant, which will answer questions, manage tasks, find photos, entertain you and help you stay on schedule. I think Google's Assistant is much better than Apple's Siri. You can have an actual conversation with Assistant. I asked the Assistant how to get to Klyde Warren Park in Dallas, and the directions from my location were displayed on a Google map. Then I asked, "When was it built?" and the Assistant brought up an article about the park and when it was built. Very cool. There are some other Android tweaks you'll notice. I had to look up the way you call up the app list on the Pixel. With other Android phones, you'll have an icon to bring up all the apps. On the Pixel, you swipe up from the bottom of the screen to bring up the apps. The apps are also pretty uniform in their appearance. All the included app icons are round. Third-party apps still can be shaped differently, but I like the round look. Overall the phone was very snappy and responsive. Conclusions I'm really happy Google has decided to get into the phone game. The company has the most popular operating system, and it's about time it designed its own hardware to take advantage of it. I'm a longtime iPhone user, so I'm a sucker for the design. I'm still on the fence about the fingerprint sensor placement. There is a lot to like about the Pixel and Pixel XL. I realize this isn't an in-depth review, but there are plenty of places online to find those. The Pixel is a hit with me, and it joins the iPhone and Samsung Galaxy 7 phones in the top tier of handsets. I can't wait to see what Google does with the next version of the Pixel The Pixel costs $649 and the XL costs $769 for the 32gb model. Add $100 to each to increase the storage to 128gb. They are available from Google, Verizon stores or Best Buy. You might see commercials or websites that say the Pixel is a Verizon exclusive, but that's just for sales. If you buy the Pixel through Google, it's unlocked for use on any carrier. Thanks to Verizon for the review phone. Google Pixel Pros: Looks like an iPhone, solid build, pure Android experience, great camera. Cons: Not water-resistant, no external storage. Bottom line: Great handsets that really allow Android to shine.

Business Technology Is Google Fiber going wireless for the last mile? Google Fiber has paused the rollout of new cities for its high speed Internet service while its explores other technology options. Reuters Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. Google Fiber has paused the roll-out of its high speed Internet in new markets including San Diego while it explores other technology options such as wireless. (Reuters) Mike FreemanContact Reporter A key hurdle to widespread gigabit-speed Internet is the high cost of getting fiber optic lines over the last mile -- from the fiber backbone in nearby streets to each house. But increasingly, cellular operators, broadband providers including Google Fiber and several startups are exploring a new, less expensive way to bridge the last mile gap – wireless technology. Google Fiber – which named San Diego as a potential city for building an ultra-fast fiber optic Internet network -- said last month that it would pause future fiber optic roll outs in San Diego and seven other potential Google Fiber cities while it explored new approaches.  Among those is wireless, including high frequency airwaves, which can deliver gigabit data rates over short, line of sight distances but also tend to bounce erratically off obstacles and degrade in rain or fog. “Millimeter wave is one of several different technologies (Google Fiber) is looking at, but it does seem to have the most promise,” said Karl Bode of broadband watchdog DSL Reports. “There are line of sight issues here, and weather can impact signal,” he continued.  “As such you need transmitters relatively close to the home, meaning you still have some notable deployment costs. Still, that's cheaper than digging up streets, which is why Google is interested.” Don’t expect Google Fiber to incorporate wireless into fiber networks anytime soon. There are still many questions about how viable wireless can be, and what licenses would be required from federal regulators in various airwave bands. But recent improvements in antenna technology and beam forming techniques to more precisely steer these high frequency airwaves are fueling optimism about their ability to span the last mile. Certain high frequency airwaves have been earmarked to become part of the spectrum dedicated for upcoming gigabit class 5G cellular networks. Last week, Verizon Communications Chief Executive Lowell McAdam spoke at the Intel Capital Global Summit in San Diego about the bandwidth capabilities of millimeter wave 5G technology, calling it “wireless fiber,” according to Murthy Renduchintala, president of Intel’s mobile and Internet of things group. “I think he said 50 percent of his costs in a fiber roll-out is from the lamp post to the home,” said Renduchintala. “So he’s basically saying if I can get high-speed ‘wireless fiber’ to the house, it would make deployments much more rapid and much more economically viable.” Verizon built its FiOS fiber optic TV and Internet network in nine states but stopped expanding into new markets in 2010, in part because of high installation costs. In October, San Diego’s Qualcomm said it would deliver the first 5G mobile modem chip, called the Snapdragon X50, next year for testing. It expects to reach top-end download speeds of 5 gigabits per second when shows up in commercial devices in 2018. Qualcomm is targeting the X50 for mobile handsets. But analysts think that “fixed wireless” markets – such as boxes that link the fiber optic backbone in the street to individual homes  – also are potential uses of this technology. With five gigabits of bandwidth, users could download an entire digital movie in less than a minute.  Skyriver, a San Diego start-up, recently completed field trials for millimeter wave point-to-multi-point technology to fuel gigabit broadband. The company said it has been acquiring spectrum rights in millimeter wave bands in several markets. For Google, affordable bandwidth is the key to its Web businesses such as Google search and YouTube. In 2012, it got into the Internet Service Provider business with Google Fiber. Today 12 cities nationwide either have Google Fiber up and running or are in development. Google has worked with these cities to install fiber on existing power poles, among other things, to keep costs down. The company’s entrance into the high speed Internet business has spurred on cable and telecom competitors to ramp their fiber optic roll outs – though most have limited expansion to new housing developments. Google has been talking with eight additional cities – San Diego, Los Angeles, San Jose, Portland, Phoenix, Chicago, Jacksonville and Tampa – as the next potential markets for Google Fiber expansion. Last month, it put those plans on hold, raising concern that it had lost its enthusiasm for Google Fiber. . In its third quarter earnings conference call, Google/Alphabet Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat said the company will continue to be an Internet Service Provider in the 12 existing cities where fiber is deployed or in the development pipeline.  “We are making great progress in those cities, and we remain very committed to growth across those cities,” she said. “We are pausing for now our work in eight cities where we have been in exploratory discussions. But very much to your question, it is to better integrate some of the technology work we have been developing.” The company is still talking with San Diego officials about permitting, micro trenching and other issues, said Stacey LoMedico, San Diego’s assistant chief operating officer.  A meeting was held earlier this week. The two sides have not yet talked about wireless, said LoMedico. Last year, Google purchased San Francisco based Webpass, which uses point-to-point microwave to deliver high speed Internet to urban apartment buildings, condo complexes and businesses in San Diego and five other cities. The company is licensed in the 70/80 Gigahertz spectrum bands, according to a Google spokesperson. It installs large antennas on top of buildings to deliver point-to-point Internet. Its then distributes bandwidth to each apartment or office. “In San Diego, Google Fiber and Webpass will work together to extend and accelerate deployments via point-to-point wireless,” said a Google spokesperson in an email. “In addition as we’ve said, we’re actively expanding our roadmap to include innovative technologies like fixed wireless that expand access to more people, faster.” A key question is how far can a high bandwidth wireless signal travel to connect the fiber node to homes? Some companies have claimed the signals can travel a bit over a mile (about two kilometers) in tests. But industry analysts think it’s unlikely to be that far in actual deployments. “I don’t think there will be any trouble going a couple hundred meters, but I think a lot of engineers are trying to figure this out,” said Christopher Taylor, director of radio frequency/wireless components at industry research firm Strategy Analytics.   Three must-see headlines <h1>Thousands made and braided bread for unity Shabbat</h1> <h1>'We're expecting:' Zoo's endangered stick insects breeding for first time ever</h1> <h1>Five beers that made San Diego famous</h1> Thousands made and braided bread for unity Shabbat 'We're expecting:' Zoo's endangered stick insects breeding for first time ever Five beers that made San Diego famous See more videos mike.freeman@sduniontribune.com;  Twitter:@TechDiego 760-529-4973 Copyright © 2016, The San Diego Union-Tribune US Politics Latest Most Popular Jobs Homes Cars Customer Help Today's Paper 78°

We have accounts everywhere, letting us kill time at work on Facebook, check Twitter for the latest news, cruise Pinterest for inspirational moodboards and hit Amazon for great shopping deals. On top of that, most of us also have a pile of inactive accounts created for discounts or one-off purchases. With our digital footprints expanding, we are relaying more personal data than ever to trackers, hackers and marketers with and without our consent. Are we sharing too much? Do we have the right not to be tracked? Is withdrawing from the Internet entirely to preserve your privacy even possible? Let's go over each of these issues. Data dangers Creating profiles at sites you use regularly has many benefits such as ease of log-in and better suggestions for links or products you might like. But with growing concern over privacy terms that change at the drop of a hat, the sale of personal data by less scrupulous websites and the challenges of keeping stalker-y exes at bay, more and more Americans are deciding to reclaim and delete their personal data. If you're among the roughly 59% of Americans who use a single password for a handful of accounts, deleting inactive accounts is an important security measure. If a hacker cracked that password, you could suffer a domino-effect hacking of your other accounts too, especially if they are linked via a common email address. Aside from the accounts and profiles we willingly create, our data is also exposed as hundreds of people search websites that comb police records, courthouse records and other public records such as real estate transactions, making our personal data publicly available to anyone who look for it. Deleting this data isn't as easy you might expect — and many companies won't remove your personal details fully. Deleting your online presence Tracking down all your data won't be easy. There is no one service that will trawl the Internet for pieces of you, so you’ll have to dig deep and create a master list of every account you’ve created in your internet life. Start with JustDelete.me A site called JustDelete.me provides an incredibly comprehensive list of email, social media, shopping and entertainment sites along with notes on how difficult it is to completely erase your account and links to actually get it done. This is a great resource to help you remember and find unused profiles as well as gauging how much effort you'll have to expend to shut it down. Find other open accounts Next, review your email accounts, looking for marketing updates and newsletters, to get wind of other accounts you may still hold or companies that have bought your email address. Then go through your phone and check for apps that have required you to create accounts. Once you've created a list of accounts you then should sort them according to how often you use them, if at all. Delete any you don't use. “Data is an asset to these companies,” says Jacqui Taylor, CEO of web science company Flying Binary. "Not only are these companies able to monetize you as their product, you aren't even receiving a service in exchange.” Working off your list of accounts, head back to JustDelete.me and use it as a springboard to start deleting accounts. Account Killer has a similar offering, and additionally can check every site you browse to for how easy it is to remove an account – before you actually create that account. To do that, grab its SiteCheck bookmarklet downloadable for Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari. If you find it tough to cancel certain accounts – for example, a subscription that mysteriously keeps on renewing, or customer service that just won’t take you off their systems – you might want to outsource the heavy lifting with Cancel Wizard, which charges $35 per cancellation to take care of hassling the rogue site on your behalf. (It appears on AccountKiller as a link to a ‘third-party cancellation form’.) Downloading and removing your content If there's data you'd like to keep — say, photos or contact lists — you may be able to download them before deleting your account. Facebook and Twitter data can be downloaded in the respective Settings tabs, while LinkedIn contacts can be exported via Contact Settings. At many sites such as Evernote and Pinterest, you won't be able to delete your account. You can only deactivate it and then manually remove personal data. At sites such as Apple, this process includes a call to customer service. Erasing your image from public spheres  Then there are the outdated or otherwise unwanted photos floating around random sites – your bio pic from the first company you worked at, or that eyes-half-shut number from that networking cocktail night. Start by searching for your name in Google, selecting the Images tab. Note what sites the pictures of you are appearing on, then individually contact the webmasters of the sites they appear on. You might do this through a contact box on the site, or by Googling the term “WhoIs [site address]” to find the registration info, including email address. If there isn’t one – or if you have no luck directly contacting the webmaster – try contacting their site’s hosting provider, which usually turns up in this search. If the photos are from accounts you’ve just shut down (or otherwise recently deleted), they may continue to appear in search results for some weeks; in that case, you can make a request for Google to remove the outdated links here. Google may also remove certain images from appearing in search results – if they contain sensitive info, like a photo of your signature or financial account details, of if they’re “revenge porn”. You can make the request here you would still need to contact the site owner to remove the images themselves, as the URL can still be found through other search engines and social media, for example.  Don't forget background checking sites To find out which background check websites have posted information about you, check out the list of popular sites on this Reddit thread. Then go to each and try searching for your name. See if you pop up in the first few pages of search results. If you do, the same Reddit thread has information on opting out, but get ready for a hassle: usually calling, faxing and sending in physical proof that you are who you say you are. After that, expect to wait anywhere from 10 working days to six weeks for information to disappear. Shutting down email You may want to reduce your internet footprint by erasing rarely used email accounts, or to stopper spam from one that’s been hacked. Head to your email account’s settings and select to delete your account. If you’re diverting email from a lesser-used account, remember to send out a message with your preferred contact details first. It’s worth noting that while Gmail makes your email address unavailable to anyone else in the future, Outlook.com releases it 60 days after you delete your account. The final comb Remember that Google – and most other search engines – personalize search results according to what you’ve searched for and clicked on in the past, potentially leaving out other pages where your info has appeared. Sign out of your account, and perform another search for your name. We’ve focused on Google as it claims 73% of global desktop searches; but it’s worth searching for your name on Bing (9%) and Yahoo (7%) to see if further instances of your name or image crop up. To request outdated content be removed, you can contact Bing here; Yahoo only removes outdated search results every six to eight weeks.  Sites that don’t allow complete withdrawal A large number of companies make it impossible to delete all traces of your accounts. According to JustDelete.me, this list includes Etsy, the online marketplace for home crafters, which retains your email address no matter what; Gawker Media, which retains the rights to all posts you made; and Netflix, which keeps your watch history and recommendations “just in case you want to come back.” Then there's Twitter, which signed a deal with the Library of Congress in 2013 giving it the right to archive all public tweets from 2006 on. This means that anything you've posted publicly since then is owned by the government and will stay archived even if you delete your account. To prevent future tweets from being saved, convert your settings to private so that only approved followers can read your tweets. (Go to the settings in the security and privacy section.) Shut down your Facebook account by going to Settings, Security and then click “Deactivate my account.” You can download all of your posts and images first by going to Settings, General and then click “Download a copy of your Facebook data.” However, you've already agreed to the social media giant’s terms and conditions, which state that Facebook has the right to keep traces of you in its monolithic servers, basically any information about you held by another Facebook user (such as conversations still in the other person's inbox or your email address if it's in a friend's contact list) will be preserved. The divide between companies that make it easy to delete your data and the companies that make it difficult is clear. “If you're the product (on such free services as the social platforms), the company tends to make it difficult,” Taylor says. Monetizing your data is the basis of the business model for such companies. For services like eBay and Paypal, Taylor adds, you aren't the product (both collect fees from sellers), making it easier to delete your account and associated data. The right to be forgotten Being able to erase social and other online data is linked to a larger issue: the right to be forgotten online. In the European Union, a Court of Justice ruling gave EU residents the right to request that irrelevant, defamatory information be removed from search engine databases. However, no such service is available to the residents of United States. “You should be able to say to any service provider that you want your data to be deleted,” Taylor says. “If someone leaves this earth, how can their data still be usable by all these companies?” When erasure isn’t an option Much of our personal data online is hosted on social platforms that regularly update their terms of service to change how our data can be used. A privacy policy that you were comfortable with when you signed on could evolve to become something you don’t agree with at all. “Your digital footprint is not under your control if you're using these free services,” Taylor says. But in an increasingly connected, virtual age, it can seem inconceivable not to have a footprint at all. Most of us use a social account to log in to dozens of other sites. Some sites require that you do so: for example, Huffington Post requires a Facebook log-in, while YouTube commenters need a Google account. Employers frequently perform background checks through Google or dedicated third-party social media checkers. In many professions, an online portfolio of work on the likes of WordPress or Tumblr is a necessity. It's becoming increasingly difficult to communicate socially without the aid of a Facebook or Twitter account. Given the realities of our connected world today, not being online can be seen as a negative. The key, Taylor says, is to take ownership of your data. Control how much of your personal data is available online by pruning inactive accounts. Create new accounts selectively, and post with the understanding that within a single update to the terms of service, your data could become publicly shared or further monetized.

Reply Facebook problem From Gina on August 05, 2015 :: 6:45 pm I deleted my FB acct over a year ago. Recently, a friend talked me into trying again. After filling in my info, I see that now, you must have a cell phone, which I don’t have, or upload an ID with your “authentic” name. I’ve been known by a nickname most of my life. It is not an “alias” or a “fake name,” it is a nickname. My friends, business associates, know me by this name. It is not the name on my ID. It is not similar. FB keeps asking for an ID with the nickname on it. I uploaded my ID with my legal name on it, but since the names don’t match, I cannot access my acct. I wish I could just delete this acct, but I cannot do it, as I cannot log in. I have e-mailed FB at least 7 times, sent a snail mail letter, but this acct is stuck. What to do? Reply Can't remove my info From Crystal Satterlee on August 14, 2015 :: 5:14 pm How to I remove my info from a site like this? http://www.uglyhomewrecker.com/ Reply That's going to be difficult From Josh Kirschner on August 14, 2015 :: 6:24 pm That’s incredibly spiteful of whoever put up that site, when it would seem the anger should be directed primarily at Doug. Your best bet is to talk to an attorney to see what your legal options are. but I’m not sure you have many. Unless the information on the site is untrue, you probably can’t sue for libel, and the First Amendment will likely trump any privacy rights. One option you may have is to play tit for tat. Threaten the website owner (who I assume you know exactly who it is) that you will put up an nearly identical site outing Doug, with his full name and details, along with the text conversation. The situation should be equally embarrassing to him and his wife. Perhaps that will encourage whoever to up the site to take it down. Let me know how things work out. Caveat: I am not an attorney. You should check with an attorney before embarking on any specific path.

Without fanfare, the familiar yellow Snapchat ghost logo was added to the Capital G website (formerly known as Google Capital) Friday. Alphabet is the parent company of Google. The addition was first reported by Business Insider. CapitalG has also invested in tech start-ups Airbnb, Uber, SurveyMonkey, Glassdoor and the Duolingo language learning app. Snapchat raised $1.81 billion in funding earlier this year, the company reported in a regulatory finding, and many press reports have said the company was on the cusp of filing an IPO in early 2017 worth anywhere from $25 to $40 billion. Snap has declined to comment. In 2013, several bloggers reported Google offered $4 billion to buy the company, then known as Snapchat, after Snap spurned Facebook's $3 billion offer. Snap and Alphabet declined comment on the Capital G investment. On its website, Capital G says its goal is "to make returns-driven investments in leading companies around the world and help entrepreneurs rapidly grow their businesses."

Messages based on the RCS spec will upgrade the SMS experience for mobile users. Google's efforts to push broad adoption of Rich Communication Services for cross-operator messaging on mobile devices appear to be gaining traction. The company announced on Nov. 4 that it has launched RCS messaging for Sprint customers that are using Android phones. The new support will allow Android users to conduct group chats, send high-resolution photos, receive and read receipts, and generally do more with chat than they currently are able to with standard Short Message Service (SMS). "Sprint subscribers will have their standard SMS experience upgraded through the Messenger apps for Android devices, developed by Google," Amir Sarhangi head of RCS, said in announcing the launch on Google Keyword blog. Sprint subscribers will see RCS support in Messenger for Android becoming available in 2017. All new Android devices from Sprint will have the RCS-enabled version of Messenger enabled by default on their systems starting next year, Sarhangi said. Existing Sprint subscribers using certain LG and Nexus phone models will automatically receive the new Messenger as an over-the-air update next year. Meanwhile, Sprint subscribers using other devices will be able to download the Messenger version with RCS via Google's Play store. Google will launch RCS with more partners in the next few months, Sarhangi added. RCS is an attempt by the GSM Association (GSMA) to develop a specification that mobile operators can use to deliver messaging services comparable to WhatsApp, Facebook and other mobile apps. Most of the SMS-based messaging services that mobile operators currently offer are harder to use and lack the rich multimedia functionality offered by such mobile apps. In addition to Sprint, a slew of other mobile operators, including Deutsche Telekom, Orange, Vodafone, Telenor Group, Bharti Airtel and Telstra, have committed to using RCS for their messaging services. Earlier this year, Google announced an initiative to work with several of these organizations to develop an Android RCS client and a common, universal profile for the RCS specification. The goal of that effort is to foster standards around RCS via the use of consistent feature sets, implementation protocols and configurations. The 58 GSMA carriers and manufactures that are engaged in the RCS initiative have agreed to use the common RCS specification—or Universal Profile for Advanced Messaging—that Google is developing. There will be two releases of the Universal Profile. The first one will launch on Nov. 17 and support a variety of capabilities, including chat, group chat, file transfer, audio messaging and video sharing across operators, according to the GSMA. The second release is scheduled for the second quarter of 2017 and will support more APIs and improved authentication and application security among other things. With this week's announcement, Sprint has become the first carrier to use the universal RCS profile.

COMPUTER After Go, StarCraft II is officially the next game for AI to conquer Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains November 04, 2016 The next victims of the automated workforce. (AP Photo/David Goldman) Share Written by Dave Gershgorn Obsession Machines with Brains November 04, 2016 First, chess fell to AI. Then Atari, and soon after, the ancient Chinese board game Go. Now, it looks like StarCraft is the next to be dominated by self-learning machines. Google DeepMind and Blizzard announced on Nov. 4 a tool that allows artificial intelligence to directly play StarCraft II. The tool, a kind of digital controller that lets AI act as a player, was built specifically for developers to let AI bots interact with the game’s interface. Researchers at DeepMind, an AI unit of Google, say that StarCraft is a particularly difficult challenge in videogames because of its complexity. Players must manage resources like minerals and gas, control hundreds of individual units, and scout unseen areas of the game’s map. “StarCraft is an interesting testing environment for current AI research because it provides a useful bridge to the messiness of the real-world,” writes Oriol Vinyals in a DeepMind blog post. “The skills required for an agent to progress through the environment and play StarCraft well could ultimately transfer to real-world tasks.” DeepMind isn’t the first to tackle StarCraft games. The Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference has been running a StarCraft AI competition since 2010, and a host of papers around AI and StarCraft emerged this year from tech companies like Facebook. A long-spanning project at Berkeley called Overmind has focused on beating StarCraft: Brood War, a game that has an open-source API like DeepMind’s. However, this is the first time that Blizzard has announced official support for hackers trying create digital players. Some researchers on Twitter lamented that Blizzard only acknowledged the research around StarCraft when a big name like DeepMind showed interest. if only a large group of ai experts had been trying to work on starcraft for years with almost zero support from blizzard 🙃🙃🙃🙃🙃 — 🍂 Mike Cook 🍂 (@mtrc) November 4, 2016 Computers already have some advantages over humans. A key figure in measuring the competence of StarCraft players is their actions per minute (APM). Humans have to click their mouse or type hotkeys to command their units. According to the StarCraft wiki, an advanced human player can perform about 2oo APM, easily attainable at the computational scale of DeepMind or Facebook. Research from Stanford in 2014 puts average APM for its StarCraft 2 bot at 1,000 to 2,000 while battling. Facebook just published two papers in the last two months about playing StarCraft, and its latest paper introduces its own open-source framework for Brood War called TorchCraft. Soumith Chintala, a researcher at Facebook’s AI lab, tweeted earlier that the company would be announcing the open-source code. Look forward to further announcements and our code release… :) https://t.co/wV567FDe8O — Soumith Chintala (@soumithchintala) November 3, 2016 Open-source code, like what DeepMind and Facebook are set to release, is fast becoming the norm in artificial-intelligence research. Many researchers believe that opening the field to others for research, while not giving away the secret sauce like the data under the algorithms, accelerates the speed at which breakthroughs occur. DeepMind says its open-source tool will be released next year. “One of the best ways to accelerate AI research is to improve the quality and diversity of environments in which to test algorithms,” Ilya Sutskever, the research director of OpenAI told Quartz in a statement. “Making StarCraft more widely available will aid the research community.” Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search

(Photo: Ted S. Warren, AP) Attention millennials, especially those living in cities. Don't panic if it comes down to late Tuesday afternoon. There are no excuses for not voting. Not work hours. Not weather. Not lack of wheels. Uber, Lyft, Google, Zipcar and Maven are offering special discounts or promotions to enable voters of all ages to get to their polling places on time. Uber and Google are offering an "in-app" feature that will help you locate your polling location and then seamlessly request a ride with just the push of a button. When you open the Uber app Tuesday, you'll see a reminder to get out and vote. ► Free Press poll: Donald Trump gains on Hillary Clinton as race in Michigan tightens Then by tapping the "Find Your Polling Place" button, which takes you a site with a Google-generated list of nearest polling stations. Next step: requesting a ride to get there. If you have managed to never take an Uber and will be requesting a ride for the first time, enter the code VOTETODAY to get $20 off. Lyft, in recognition that we are electing the nation's 45th president, will offer a 45% discount on one ride between 7 a.m. and 8 p.m. for metro Detroit passengers. All Detroit Lyft users can access this promotion through the Deal of the Week e-mail they receive Sunday night. If you've never used Lyft before, just download the app and use the code NOVEMBER8TH to receive $5 off your first 10 rides. On the car-sharing front, Zipcar will make 74 cars available for free between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. Tuesday night. But remember, polls close at 8 p.m. ► Free Press 2016 Endorsements: The full list One must be a Zipcar member to use the service. Members can reserve free Zipcars on the mobile app or online starting today through Tuesday. New members can join instantly by downloading the app. Zipcar spokeswoman Katelyn Chesley said there will be 26 free cars at the company's stations in the city of Detroit, one at Metro Airport, three in Dearborn, one in Flint, and 43 in Ann Arbor. General Motors' Maven ride-sharing business will offer $5 off all day, according to GM spokeswoman Annalisa Bluhm. No one, however, will be able to complete his or her ballot by app. That must be done the old-school way. ► Voter Guide: Hear what the candidates have to say Contact Greg Gardner: 313-222-8762 or ggardner@freepress.com.

NATION Harvard cancels men's soccer season for long-running practice of sexually ranking the women's team Kirkland House At Harvard University Bill Greene / Boston Globe A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. (Bill Greene / Boston Globe) Matt Pearce The evidence that would bring down the Harvard men’s soccer team was hiding in plain sight for years: publicly available emails, in the men’s own words, showing them sexually ranking new freshmen members of the 2012 women’s soccer team. “She looks like the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated,” one of the men’s players wrote of a female in his eight-page “scouting report,” sent to his teammates, which assigned number rankings and potential sexual positions to the women. Of another player, he wrote: “She seems to be very strong, tall and manly so, I gave her a 3 because I felt bad. Not much needs to be said on this one folks.” Many of his comments are too crude to print, but they seemed to meet approval from his teammates: Of several who responded to the author’s “report,” one man wrote, “hahahahaha well done.” Worse still, the messages suggested that the “scouting report” wasn’t a one-time act of collective sexism, but a yearly ritual. Rolling Stone defamed University of Virginia administrator in rape story, jury finds Associated Press A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... (Associated Press) The messages had been publicly archived on a Google group-emailing service, Google Groups, and sat unnoticed for four years — until Harvard’s student newspaper, the Crimson, found and published the comments last week in a story that rocked one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions of higher learning. (The Crimson’s report did not identify the individual men behind the emails.) On Thursday, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise canceled the remainder of the men’s 2016 soccer season and banned them from post-season play, citing an investigation by the University’s Office of the General Counsel that turned up evidence of more recent “scouting reports” of the freshmen women. “Based on that review, I understand that this practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016, and that current students who participated were not immediately forthcoming about their involvement,” Scalise wrote in a message to Harvard’s athletes. Scalise said the department would work with the campus Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to educate the men’s soccer team and other athletic teams, adding that “Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior.” The 2016 men’s team apologized Friday in an open letter in the Crimson, saying that “no woman deserves to be treated in this manner.” “We accept responsibility for the mistakes and serious lapses in judgment that have led us here, and, in addition to accepting the sanctions from the Athletic Department, are shifting our focus toward the concrete actions we can take to address the fundamental issue of sexism in our community,” said the apology, which was attributed collectively to the team. A reporter for the Crimson, C. Ramsey Fahs, discovered the soccer team’s publicly available Google Group and the emails while “doing some digging on an entirely different issue,” the Crimson’s student president, Mariel Klein, told the Los Angeles Times. Members of the men’s soccer team changed the group’s settings to “private” after the Crimson contacted them for comment, said Klein, who called the crude report “a powerful document to see” in light of recent discussions on campus about sexism and sexual assault. Harvard President Drew Faust said she was “deeply distressed” to learn about the men’s behavior and supported the team’s suspension, adding, “The team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable.”  The postseason ban includes the Ivy League championship and the NCAA tournament, and the suspension ends a promising season. The men’s team had been leading the Ivy League standings and was ranked 15th nationally in the NCAA’s RPI ratings. “We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” men’s coach Pieter Lehrer said in a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times through the university. “Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.” Members of the women’s squad who had been featured in the 2012 report said they had initially brushed off the news but said the story became more unbearable after it picked up traction in the mainstream media, which they blamed for latching on to the story because of Harvard’s name. “The sad reality is that we have come to expect this kind of behavior from so many men, that it is so ‘normal’ to us we often decide it is not worth our time or effort to dwell on,” six women’s players wrote in an op-ed for the Crimson, expressing disappointment that “close friends” on the men’s team had been quietly carrying out the sexist practice. But the women asked the men and others to join them in hoping the story would lead to a more “productive conversation” on so-called “locker room talk” that extends far beyond the world’s locker rooms. “We are human beings, and we should be treated with dignity,” the women wrote. “We want your help in combating this. We need your help in preventing this. We cannot change the past, but we are asking you to help us now and in the future.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

Nov 4th 2016, 9:35 PM 11,442 Views 59 Comments Share23 Tweet Email1 Image: Niall Carson/PA Wire GOOGLE FUNNELED MORE than €22.6 billion in sales from across Europe and other territories through its Irish subsidiary last year – a near-one-quarter increase on the 2014 tally. Newly filed accounts for the search giant’s local arm, Google Ireland, also show the company paid €47.8 million in corporate tax to the Exchequer after the vast majority of its profits were eaten away in assorted administrative expenses. The subsidiary recorded a gross profit of €17.1 billion for the year, up nearly 27% on the 2014 tally, but costs also rose as more money was transferred out in royalties to another, unspecified Google firm. The company’s net profit stood at €293.5 million. Google Ireland accounts for its US parent company’s sales for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, as well as operating two data centres located in the Republic. The documents also show that the company directly employed 2,934 people at the end of 2015 – a 6% increase on the total workforce 12 months earlier. More than two-thirds of the workforce were employed in sales and marketing, with the remainder split between admin, engineering and operations roles. The accounts also note that the company spent €111 million on research, development and engineering during the year. Taoiseach Enda Kenny and Google Ireland head Ronan Harris Source: Sam Boal/RollingNews.ie A key driver In a statement, Google vice president Ronan Harris, who is moving from the Dublin office to London to oversee both the company’s UK and Irish operations, said the local operation was “recognised as a key driver of growth among our customers”. He said the company was also supporting the Irish startup community through projects like its Google for Entrepreneurs partnership with Dogpatch Labs. In addition to the 3,000-odd people the company employs directly, Harris said it also had “in the region” of 3,000 staff in contracted positions.

NATION Harvard cancels men's soccer season for long-running practice of sexually ranking the women's team Kirkland House At Harvard University Bill Greene / Boston Globe A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. A file shows the Harvard University campus on Feb. 14, 2012. (Bill Greene / Boston Globe) Matt Pearce The evidence that would bring down the Harvard men’s soccer team was hiding in plain sight for years: publicly available emails, in the men’s own words, showing them sexually ranking new freshmen members of the 2012 women’s soccer team. “She looks like the kind of girl who both likes to dominate, and likes to be dominated,” one of the men’s players wrote of a female in his eight-page “scouting report,” sent to his teammates, which assigned number rankings and potential sexual positions to the women. Of another player, he wrote: “She seems to be very strong, tall and manly so, I gave her a 3 because I felt bad. Not much needs to be said on this one folks.” Many of his comments are too crude to print, but they seemed to meet approval from his teammates: Of several who responded to the author’s “report,” one man wrote, “hahahahaha well done.” Worse still, the messages suggested that the “scouting report” wasn’t a one-time act of collective sexism, but a yearly ritual. Rolling Stone defamed University of Virginia administrator in rape story, jury finds Associated Press A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house.

A federal jury on Friday found Rolling Stone magazine, its publisher and a reporter defamed a University of Virginia administrator in a discredited story about gang rape at a fraternity house. The 10-member jury found journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely was responsible for libel, with actual malice.... (Associated Press) The messages had been publicly archived on a Google group-emailing service, Google Groups, and sat unnoticed for four years — until Harvard’s student newspaper, the Crimson, found and published the comments last week in a story that rocked one of the nation’s most prestigious institutions of higher learning. (The Crimson’s report did not identify the individual men behind the emails.) On Thursday, Athletics Director Robert L. Scalise canceled the remainder of the men’s 2016 soccer season and banned them from post-season play, citing an investigation by the University’s Office of the General Counsel that turned up evidence of more recent “scouting reports” of the freshmen women. “Based on that review, I understand that this practice appears to be more widespread across the team and has continued beyond 2012, including in 2016, and that current students who participated were not immediately forthcoming about their involvement,” Scalise wrote in a message to Harvard’s athletes. Scalise said the department would work with the campus Office of Sexual Assault Prevention and Response to educate the men’s soccer team and other athletic teams, adding that “Harvard Athletics has zero tolerance for this type of behavior.” The 2016 men’s team apologized Friday in an open letter in the Crimson, saying that “no woman deserves to be treated in this manner.” “We accept responsibility for the mistakes and serious lapses in judgment that have led us here, and, in addition to accepting the sanctions from the Athletic Department, are shifting our focus toward the concrete actions we can take to address the fundamental issue of sexism in our community,” said the apology, which was attributed collectively to the team. A reporter for the Crimson, C. Ramsey Fahs, discovered the soccer team’s publicly available Google Group and the emails while “doing some digging on an entirely different issue,” the Crimson’s student president, Mariel Klein, told the Los Angeles Times. Members of the men’s soccer team changed the group’s settings to “private” after the Crimson contacted them for comment, said Klein, who called the crude report “a powerful document to see” in light of recent discussions on campus about sexism and sexual assault. Harvard President Drew Faust said she was “deeply distressed” to learn about the men’s behavior and supported the team’s suspension, adding, “The team’s behavior and the failure to be forthcoming when initially questioned are completely unacceptable.”  The postseason ban includes the Ivy League championship and the NCAA tournament, and the suspension ends a promising season. The men’s team had been leading the Ivy League standings and was ranked 15th nationally in the NCAA’s RPI ratings. “We are beyond disappointed that our season has ended in this way, but we respect the decision made by our administration,” men’s coach Pieter Lehrer said in a statement provided to the Los Angeles Times through the university. “Actions have consequences, and character counts. We accept responsibility for our actions, and I know that we will use the experience of this terribly unfortunate situation to be better.” Members of the women’s squad who had been featured in the 2012 report said they had initially brushed off the news but said the story became more unbearable after it picked up traction in the mainstream media, which they blamed for latching on to the story because of Harvard’s name. “The sad reality is that we have come to expect this kind of behavior from so many men, that it is so ‘normal’ to us we often decide it is not worth our time or effort to dwell on,” six women’s players wrote in an op-ed for the Crimson, expressing disappointment that “close friends” on the men’s team had been quietly carrying out the sexist practice. But the women asked the men and others to join them in hoping the story would lead to a more “productive conversation” on so-called “locker room talk” that extends far beyond the world’s locker rooms. “We are human beings, and we should be treated with dignity,” the women wrote. “We want your help in combating this. We need your help in preventing this. We cannot change the past, but we are asking you to help us now and in the future.” Caption 90 seconds: 4 stories you can't miss Trump names Priebus and Bannon as top aides, California National Guard interpreters say they're owed bonuses, UC and Cal State are considering their first tuition hikes in 6 years, and L.A.

And thanks to this new tech wave, the truly savvy among us are learning to bring all kinds of consumer tech into the beauty game—the latest of which is a little gadget called Google Home. For the tech uninitiated among us, Google Home falls into a category of “smart speakers” (where it keeps company with Amazon Echo), but it’s basically an IRL version of Google’s search bar—sit the chic speaker on your dresser and you can ask it just about anything while your hands are busy with your a.m. beauty routine. Here are some ways you can use Google Home to reach peak tech and beauty guru status. 1. Get the latest news on product drops. The next time you’re running low on your Kylie Lip Kit supply, rather than launching into full-on panic mode, you can simply ask Google when you can expect the next drop. Then have good old Google Home verify your schedule so you can plan accordingly. 2. Find the best product dupes. The great thing about Google Home is that it’s pretty much a living version of the wealth of info Google has at its disposal. Searching for a good product dupe? Have your new BFF/beauty concierge do it for you rather than spending forever clicking around—that’s so twentieth century. The Easter eggs inside the "mind" of Google Home: 3. Factor the weather into your makeup routine. One of Google Home’s more basic features is that it can give you instant weather updates, which will totally come in handy when you’re getting ready in the morning. Raining? Reach for the waterproof mascara. Windy? Start working on an intentionally messy-chic braid. Just put in your home address (or wherever you're located) and ask a question: "OK, Google, is it going to rain today in New York?" we asked. Thankfully, Google answered no, so we slathered on sunscreen before greeting the sunny day. 4. Find the nearest beauty store. Google Home also has a whole world of directions programmed into its chic little brain. While Google can’t actually do your errands for you, it can tell you where to find a beauty store close to the office when you’re running low on essentials. To the question, "Where is the nearest Sephora?" Google Home spit out a list of locations. 5. Get the latest news on steals and sales. Google Home also doubles as your very own beauty news hound. Ask it if your favorite stores are having any sales before you make your weekend plans. 6. Keep a running list of beauty buys. If you’re anything like us, you have an endless and ever-evolving beauty wish list. Next time you hear about a new product you have to get your hands on, just have Google Home add it to your running list of must-haves. It's as simple as commanding, "Add perfume to my shopping list." The verdict: Google Home is a sleek, tiny speaker that will look great atop your vanity table—it looks like a chic air freshener, no? Designed with Google's new phone, the Pixel, in mind (though it works for iPhones and Androids), the product is great for tracking household tasks like shopping lists and keeping up with the weather. It's not perfect—you have to remember to ask each question with "OK, Google," though it can remember the context of your first question if you want to follow up with another query. For just $129, this little gadget would probably make a great holiday gift for the techie in your life.

AI can now see secrets through lipreading – kinda Siri, clone yourself and dive into this Samsung Galaxy S8 smartphone UK AI ethics board to launch Vid Google DeepMind is partnering with Blizzard Entertainment, the producers of the hugely popular StarCraft game, to set the real-time strategy game as the next challenge in AI. The announcement was made during BlizzCon, a video games convention held by Blizzard Entertainment today, and comes right after researchers from Facebook and the University of Oxford published a paper with the same goal in mind. We're collaborating with @Blizzard_Ent to open up StarCraft II as an AI research environment for the global community in Q1 2017! pic.twitter.com/d2kIeV8mkv — DeepMind (@DeepMindAI) November 4, 2016 Google’s AI arm has been trying to crack general intelligence since it was founded in 2011, often through playing games. Under Demis Hassabis, who was a child prodigy in chess and previously an AI programmer for Lionhead Studios, a British video games developer, the company pursued Go. It made headlines this March when its AI software AlphaGo beat Go mastermind Lee Sedol. Now, DeepMind is making a beeline for StarCraft. Developers from DeepMind and Blizzard Entertainment’s StarCraft II team have been working on creating an API that supports “something similar to previous bots written with a 'scripted' interface, allowing programmatic control of individual units and access to the full game state,” DeepMind said in a blog post. The Starcraft DQN-powered AI bots will play directly from pixels; the team has created an image-based interface that allows the bot to make sense of its surroundings on the game map. The details of the game, such as unit type or unit health, will be monitored through separate “layers.” Below is a video showing off what players and bots can see. Youtube Video Not only has Blizzard made it simpler for researchers to build their bots, it’ll be easier to test them too, with something called “curriculum scenarios.” The scenarios are a series of tasks that get progressively harder for the AI gaming bot to complete, and they act as a “benchmark” for algorithms. More interestingly, researchers will also be able to create their own scenarios using the editing tools in StarCraft II. Many researchers recognize the potential of using games as a test bed for AI. Navigating virtual environments effectively could lead to potential applications in real life. It’s an area that DeepMind is also interested in, and it has attempted to apply simple AI software to robots. Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI research director, welcomed using StarCraft II as a way for researchers to advance AI. “One of the best ways to accelerate AI research is to improve the quality and diversity of environments in which to test algorithms. Making StarCraft more widely available will aid the research community," Sutskever told The Register. “Solving the game requires computers to be able to plan ahead, deal with uncertainty and imagine possible outcomes – these are all open problems that OpenAI and other organizations are working on. We think surprising breakthroughs will happen as researchers can start testing their algorithms on new games." ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 7 Comments More from The Register Blizzard blighted by another DDoS storm Someone likes fragging servers 9 Comments Blizzard shows off Overwatch – yet another guardians of Earth FPS Vids Once again the Americans mangle British accents 7 Comments Titan falls!

November 4 AAPL: 108.84 -0.99 Opinion: From the enthusiast to the general consumer, Apple’s recipe for success has become boring Edoardo Maggio - 1 week ago @northead Opinion Apple View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit [First of all, I would like to say that this is but my very own take, which is not necessarily shared by my colleagues here at 9to5Mac and therefore not an editorial, staff-wise opinion piece. It represents my view and my view only, so try to keep that in mind.] Up until not too long ago, I used to ask myself a simple question: if I were to pick one company — and one company alone — to rely on for all of my “tech needs”, which one would I choose? The answer would come rather swiftly: Apple. As a critic (by nature more than profession) I have always seen the vast majority of products skeptically, but that didn’t take from the fact that the Cupertino giant made what I considered to be the best smartphone, the best tablet, the best computers and even two of the most valid operating systems around, accounting for a sweet, unified and well-connected package that would make me feel like I didn’t have to look outside of it. It was Apple’s dream of ecosystem lock-in, essentially. However, as my view of this universe has got more and more panoramic — especially in the last year of collaboration with the sister site 9to5Google, which has helped me a lot to gain even more direct experience with Apple’s competition — I started to have a feeling that this bubble was somewhat bursting. And this feeling is something I simply haven’t been able to shake, and one that has brought me, like apparently many others, to think that the well-oiled profit machine Apple Inc. may have lost some of its touch, for what concerns the present and, more importantly, the future… Apple has long been one of the giants that, thanks to its focus on hardware, managed to surprise and delight me; before I actually got into tech, I fell in love with iPods, which slowly got me into the magical world of Apple products. I remember vividly the day I unboxed my iPhone 5, and just how much ahead of the rest of the tech world that product was bringing me. From its famous introduction to my own unboxing and the first weeks of use, I just couldn’t believe how much I was loving that little thing. Less than a year later I finally caved in and bought a Retina MacBook Pro, the same machine I’m still typing this very piece on, and again couldn’t help but repeatedly fall in love with my gear — and indeed, if you’re reading this piece right now, Apple’s efforts have played a big part in pushing me towards the lucky place I am in at this point in time. One thing I’m sure of, in fact, is that Apple is still incredibly competent and absolutely fantastic at what it does — say what you say about its products or controversial moves, but there likely is no other company on Earth that has the influence of Apple, and I am actually thankful for their choice of taking the reins and doing things such as eliminating old technologies and springing us towards the future, no matter how inconvenient that transition may be. I do understand the users’ complaints — more on that later — but I also try to fit into Apple’s shoes, and there is a case to be made for doing what they’ve done. I do not take issue with that. Again, looking at their lineup, it still strikes me how a relatively focussed — albeit expanding — portfolio of products still makes it possible to produce such incredible pieces of hardware: the iPhone 7 could still easily be considered the best smartphone around, the iPad Pros are great machines, the new MacBooks have a lot going for them, the 5K iMac’s display still makes my mouth water every time I go to a store and look at it, and hell, I absolutely love my little 6th gen. iPod touch. Apple Store in London’s Covent Garden I see more Apple products around than any other brand’s — living in central London surely helps with this, but there’s no denying that the company’s reach is enviable, to say the least — and I am fairly sure that a good chunk of its customers are extremely happy with their Apple-logoed machines. And yet, after all this sweet talking, I feel like I have to address the main issue highlighted in the title. And that is: Apple is boring. And let me get this straight: Apple isn’t just boring by its own standards, but it’s being trumped by other companies too, big time — and often by names you most certainly wouldn’t expect. A few years ago — two and a half, to be exact — at their annual I/O developer conference, Google announced its new, company-wide design system to rethink not just how the design issue should be tackled within tech, but also how we should actually think of it. Material Design was (and still is) an incredibly ambitious, ongoing project, which for the first time put the search giant into that increasingly important conversation. While watching the keynote, I was simply stunned. I was very hyped when, just twelve months prior to that, Apple was to reinvent its software design with iOS 7, and while Ive’s introduction video became what I deem to be his masterpiece (because yes, of course Ive’s voiceovers are a thing) it was quickly turned into nothingness, kneeling before the scale of Google’s ambition. Indeed, Apple had long been a tech design keystone in both hardware (predominantly) and software (more or less), but seeing what Google was aiming at made Apple’s new software approach seem childish to my eyes. And, beware: I say ‘childish’ not because of its execution — an entirely different matter — but rather in its scope. From that moment on I started reading about this upcoming post-mobile “cross war” between the two behemoths: is Google going to become good at design before Apple nails services? Almost 30 months later, I honestly feel like the answer to that question is yes. Material Design is not perfect, and as Google itself reminds us, it is “never done”, but seeing where the company — and all of its products, starting with Android — was just two years ago and where it is now is, in my opinion, nothing short of incredible. Consistency needs to be addressed, but in this short amount of time the Mountain View firm was capable of doing what many would have thought of as impossible, which is linking the words “Google Design” with “gorgeous”. No, seriously, go take a look. On the other hand, Apple’s services have done wonders for the company, but none of them has had a truly identifiable “wow” moment in my mind. Their biggest investment, Apple Music, has proved to be little more than just another music subscription service, and both iOS 8, 9 and 10 as well as the last three iterations of OS X/macOS have done very little to genuinely impress and enchant me. If anything, the one thing I was excited about — 3D Touch — is the one I have experienced less, as my go-to iOS device does not support it. All in all, each version of the two OSs has mostly looked like a game of very small and incremental catch-ups to me, which I’ve come to realize increasingly more as I noticed that my usage of iOS and macOS was not being drastically altered. Which brings me straight to Apple’s stronghold: products. Remember the question I would ask myself all the time? That question’s changed. Now it’s more like: when was the last time that I was actually thrilled by an Apple product? And, much to my own dismay, the answer is “I don’t know”. It could perhaps be the 2015 12” MacBook, which indeed, for all its shortcomings, had something special to it, but even that would be a choice driven by exclusion rather than absolute, buzz-led certainty. Have you noticed that I haven’t mentioned the Watch even once so far? Such is its ‘forgettability’, in my view. It’s a product that hasn’t caught my attention at launch and that I still don’t see much agitation around for, not even from Apple itself. It doesn’t really make the case for a compelling device, much less an essential one; something that Apple had always strived for. Perhaps at fault, but when the original iPad came out I did think “Yes, I need this” — or at least “I want this”. It was bold, and ambitious, and beautiful, and new. It was so very Apple. But that doesn’t seem to be the case anymore. It particularly struck me when the iPhone 6s came out: somehow, even weeks after the announcement, my Twitter feed was filled with comments regarding that stupid pink color way more than the decidedly more interesting 3D Touch technology. Did Apple fail to communicate its importance? Or had we all rather become so numb not to actually expect anything from Apple given that it was an “s” model? Honestly, I don’t know. What I do know is that whatever magic used to be there has long been absent outside of Cupertino. You know who’s actually making great products? Microsoft. Yes — the same Microsoft we’ve all laughed at because of Internet Explorer or the buggy, crappy versions of Windows running on that fat, plasticky — and now dusty — black laptop somewhere in the corner of your room. Or, well, not exactly the same company, to be fair. Much like Google, 2014 saw a watershed moment for the Redmond mammoth, with the arrival of Satya Nadella and his more or less complete overhaul of the tore-apart, losing and clueless firm Steve Ballmer had left behind him. And oh boy, how much have they changed. But just for the sake of tying it in with Apple, I will simply recall the moment that has caught my attention the most: the iPad Pro introduction, and Apple’s essential bequest of the “Pro” part to Microsoft. “These guys know productivity,” admitted Schiller last year. And it’s sad to say, but it was one of the most memorable moments of Apple’s keynotes in recent years. After all, which product inspired its very creation? Microsoft has also gotten much more aggressive at Apple’s own hardware game, in fact: look at Surface. They may have not cracked it with the first iterations — or, arguably, yet — but the Pro 3 and Pro 4 are fantastic devices. Bold, ambitious, beautiful and new, dare I say. Rings a bell? And they almost certainly didn’t stop there. Look at the Surface Book: it may, again, not be the “ultimate laptop” Microsoft claims, but it certainly is a far more exciting one than Apple’s latest MacBooks. And yes, you guessed it — the Surface Studio is again a more far-reaching and inspiring product than the iMac. Microsoft, it appears, is making a way better Apple-impression than Apple is. It’s now gotten to the point where Microsoft is seemingly addressing those customers that have long prayed at Apple’s altar, and that the company is now neglecting. The MacBook Pro is actually not a “pro” machine, I hear them say. I read that just about over 100 times in 100 slightly different ways — which is striking, to say the least. And bear in mind that all those complaints come from people who have actually used and loved Apple products likely much more than I have, and whose criticisms therefore have much more weight. But yes, even as a “simpler” Apple customer and lover, this saddens me. And as a more seasoned observer, I struggle to see cohesion: Tim Cook said that the iPad Pro eliminated the need for a PC. “No, really, why would you buy one?” he said. But then Apple has come out with three new Pro laptops, the simpler of which is remarkably closer to the 12” MacBook than to its more powerful peers. And then the Air has been all but forgotten. Then again, you also have the iPad Pro (two, in fact), with too many overlapping features and price points and not enough uniqueness to make me understand what exactly they want to be. Jobs put the iPad clearly in between the iPhone and the Mac; now everything seems blurry, confused. And this is only one practical example. Ironically, Microsoft’s ideas of a ‘tablet that can also be a laptop’ and a ‘laptop that can also be a tablet’ make much more sense, because at least they run the same (great) operating system, and most of all know what they want to be. I’m not saying that they are necessarily better devices — that still largely depends on your preferences and needs — but trying to look at it just from an external perspective, I see the Surface lineup as the clear pinnacle of the current hardware game. Apple may still be a leader, but they sure aren’t the most forward-pushing innovator they were before. There is no doubt that Apple is still a company in great shape and with a lot of good going on for it. I am still faithful that something around the corner may at least bring some of that excitement back. There are so many uncharted territories for them, like VR, AR, AI-trailed products like Amazon’s Echo or Google Home — and then god only knows what else, even leaving the rumored car out of the picture. But as things are right now, I feel like Apple has, at least partially, lost its way. I don’t understand whether the dissonance between its virtually endless (and growing!) customer base and their business decisions has made it so that enthusiasts simply couldn’t be their main target anymore, but recent products — be it because of their price, compromises or just better alternatives from other OEMs — make me question whether even your average Joe is the ideal one. Next year’s major iPhone redesign could indeed bring some much-needed fresh air to the game, and I very much look forward to that — and I still hope that much more is to come. Innovation and competition are the best thing this industry has to offer, and Apple can’t afford to battle only at the box office. So please, Apple: stay hungry, stay foolish.

However, it seems that someone slipped up and started shipping the Daydream View VR headset to a few folks. The problem with this is that those users can’t use the new VR headset. Google will be releasing an accompanying application once the headset is made available to everyone later this month, but that application isn’t available on the Play Store as of yet. The app is called “Google VR Services” and the new Daydream headset can’t function without it, so if you’ve received your headset, you’re out of luck. For the rest of us who are waiting for our headsets to ship, we are expecting that to occur within the next week or two, so it’s likely the app will be released very soon. If you want to pre-order the Daydream View headset, you can still do so from Google, and the headset will be available for purchase from Best Buy, Verizon, and the Google Store for $79.

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Analytics Firm Claims Pixel Adoption Rate Higher Than Nexus 6P Posted: Nov 4 2016, 12:47pm CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, Updated: Nov 5 2016, 11:32am CDT, in News | Technology News   Appboy   Seems like Google Pixel is doing well as compared to the Nexus 6P. The Pixel duo is the first series of home grown Smartphones by Google. Google previously collaborated with other device makers to create Nexus Phones. Don't Miss: Best Walmart Black Friday 2016 Deals According to Appboy, Google has never pushed this much for a phone as it is doing for the Pixel phones. As per the firm this hard work is actually paying off. Coming to the statistics Google XL reached a market share comparable to that of Nexus 6P two weeks after launch. These numbers also include the stock shortages observed both at Verizon and Google stores. The Google XL doubled its launch day numbers in merely a week. Its percentage increase was 158%. Don’t underestimate the smaller Pixel. It is also showing amazing growth too. Just after a week of its launch its numbers increased by 274%. If we compare these results with the market leader Samsung, the S7 took a week extra to double its numbers. On the other hand its predecessor Galaxy S6 grew 171% in a week. The relative numbers indicate the Pixel is the winner. However the absolute number of the Samsung Galaxy S phones in the first week is far more than the Pixel. Pixel proves itself. The results are not at all bad for a new brand in this competitive Smartphone industry.   You May Like The Author Ahmed Humayun Ahmed Humayun is a technology journalist bringing you the hottest tech stories of the day.     Advertisement Leave a Comment Share this Story Follow Us Read the Latest from I4U News The Third-Party Apps That will Use MacBook’s Pro Touch Bar 8 hours ago Dell EMC unveils new IT products and solutions 9 hours ago Amazon Alexa Prize Competing Teams include Students from Berkeley, Princeton and Carnegie-Mellon 9 hours ago Technology and Fashion: Why Innovation Is a Must for Survival 10 hours ago Qualcomm Quick Charge 4.0 to support 28W 1 day ago, 10:06am CST Apple Pay Can Now Be Used for Donations 52 minutes ago Soyuz Spacecraft Arrives at Baikonur Launchpad ahead of ISS Mission 1 hour ago Macy's Black Friday 2016 Deals Previewed 4 hours ago U.S. Parents are Spanking their Kids Less Today, Study Finds 4 hours ago Hatchimals and NES Classic Stock Gone Online 4 hours ago Financial Phishing To Increase This Holiday Season 5 hours ago Jaguar's First All-Electric SUV I-Pace Revealing is Tomorrow 5 hours ago NextEV Previews its Hypercar Ahead of Next Week Debut 5 hours ago Facebook and Twitter Helped me Win Says Trump 5 hours ago Black Friday Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR Headset Deals Are Weak 5 hours ago Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Target Black Friday 2016 ad Best Buy Black Friday 2016 ad All Black Friday 2016 ads How to Find Hatchimals Deals Find NES Classic Deals Featured News Black Friday Oculus Rift and HTC Vive VR Headset Deals Are Weak Walmart Black Friday 2016 Ad Released   All Black Friday 2016 Deals on Samsung TVs Announced Sam's Club Samsung Saturday Sale on Nov. 19 Announced Technology News The Third-Party Apps That will Use MacBook’s Pro Touch Bar 8 hours ago Dell EMC unveils new IT products and solutions 9 hours ago Amazon Alexa Prize Competing Teams include Students from Berkeley, Princeton and Carnegie-Mellon 9 hours ago Technology and Fashion: Why Innovation Is a Must for Survival 10 hours ago More Technology News Stories Latest News Apple Pay Can Now Be Used for Donations 52 minutes ago Soyuz Spacecraft Arrives at Baikonur Launchpad ahead of ISS Mission 1 hour ago $299.99 50-inch Samsung UN50J5201AFXZA Smart TV Best Buy Black Friday 2016 Deal 3 hours ago Macy's Black Friday 2016 Deals Previewed 4 hours ago More Latest News The Latest ...

X Surge in Google Ireland sales to €22bn offset as part of tax planning Sales up 23% while after-tax profits jump 72% as “Google Network” partners sign up Fri, Nov 4, 2016, 16:19 Mark Paul The number of staff directly employed by Google Ireland last year increased 6% to nearly 3,000. The company says it also employs about 3,000 contractors on its Irish sites.         Google Ireland, the Dublin-based hub through which the search engine diverts sales from across Europe, the Middle East and Africa, recorded a 23 per cent rise in revenues last year, to €22.6 billion. Newly filed accounts show its after-tax profit jumped 72 per cent to €293.6 million. Google Ireland paid €46.5 million in Irish corporation tax. Most of its extra €4.3 billion income, however, was wiped out by larger royalty payments to other parts of the Google empire abroad as part of the company’s extensive tax planning under so-called “transfer pricing” rules. In commentary attached to the accounts, Google said its “administrative expenses” rose by about €3.5 billion to €16.9 billion. It provided no further details on the make-up of these expenses, which do not incorporate revenue sharing arrangements with other web companies. Those are accounted for separately. Google attributed the rise in administrative expenses to “increased head count”, an “increase in sales and marketing effort”, and “an increase in the royalties paid to a group undertaking”. Fionnuala Meehan to replace Ronan Harris as Google head EU not investigating Google’s European tax deals – Vestager Digital ad spending accelerates as mobile overtakes desktop Its average head count rose by about 250 employees and its total payroll cost €365 million, suggesting the bulk of the €16.9 billion in “administrative expenses” involved a cash royalty to another part of the group. Royalty location The company’s financial statements, which were filed on Friday afternoon, did not disclose the location of the entity to which the royalties were paid. It has been reported in previous years, however, that Google Ireland has paid royalties to an entity in the Netherlands as part of the “Double Irish” tax avoidance strategy, which is being phased out under new State rules. In previous years, the Dutch entity has moved these royalties on to other Google entities in tax-free offshore locations such as Bermuda. A spokesperson for Google Ireland said the increase in “administrative expenses is consistent with the increase in sales”. ADVERTISEMENT The number of staff directly employed by Google increased 6 per cent to nearly 3,000 by year’s end. It also employs about 3,000 contractors on its Irish sites, which include its two Dublin data centres and a sales hub in Dublin’s docklands. Ronan Harris, the outgoing head of its Irish operations, attributed the surge in sales to selling more ads to a greater number of members of the Google Network – other websites that direct search queries through Google’s website. “As Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit,” Mr Harris said. “In 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over €750 million. “Dublin is recognised as a key driver of growth among our customers,” he added. “Last year, for example, we established the AppHub to help developers take advantage of the potential €60 billion European Union app economy.”       Topics: Ronan Harris Mark Paul Business Affairs European Union Google Africa Bermuda Dublin(IE) Europe Ireland Netherlands Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Agribusiness & Food Greencore shares rise sharply on news of $746m acquisition in US Work Lucy Kellaway: I don’t want my employers to feel my pain English Soccer Bastian Schweinsteiger begins talks over move to Chicago Business Sensors help police curb gang violence in Cape Town Sponsored Newbridge Silverware builds ambitious plan for US market My Jaguar F-Pace: ‘I was completely blown away’ Ten things to consider when buying a new sofa Power up your company's pension plan ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Latest Business Irish firms more worried about Brexit than British counterparts 00:01 Investors focus on Trump’s infrastructure spending plans 23:07 Cantillon: To spend or not to spend – FF seem to want it both ways 19:49 Court to fast-track legal challenge to Apple data centre in Athenry 19:25 Cantillon: Irish pension savers cautiously watch bond markets 19:18 ADVERTISEMENT Tech Tools Could sleep problems be a thing of the past with Sense?

Especially if you already use a lot of Google services, pitching $129 for a device that sits right between the Echo and Echo Dot in size might be a good choice for you. Now, the device is available for purchase from several retailers… Early this week, Google Home started popping up at Walmart stores, but even if you saw one, you probably weren’t going to be able to buy one until today. Our own Justin Duino saw one, actually, and after taking the device to the register was told that it shouldn’t have been on the shelves and that they weren’t allowed to sell it. That’s not the case anymore. As highlighted in a tweet sent out by Google this morning, you should be able to find a Google Home on the shelf (and actually be able to buy one) at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart for $129. You can also buy one outright from the Google Store with an estimated shipping dat of sometime around a week from now. If you haven’t already, be sure to read our review and check out our unboxing video. Voice-activated, hands-free help is here! #GoogleHome now at @BestBuy, @GoogleStore, @Target & @Walmart. https://t.co/chUICKoEEu pic.twitter.com/Sde4ok6EHU — Made by Google (@madebygoogle) November 4, 2016 Guides Google Home View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

One problem: over 41% of apps using OAuth 2.0 aren't actually validating user info, allowing account hijacks. By Brandon Vigliarolo | November 4, 2016, 11:50 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Jakub Jirsak Single sign on (SSO) services are definitely convenient: Think of all the apps on your mobile device that let you log in using your Google or Facebook accounts. Chances are there's quite a few—over 600 top ranked apps on Google Play use the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It's definitely convenient to skip account creation or signing in for every single app you install, but it's not without risks. In this case the risk is serious: 41.2% of the aforementioned 600 apps are putting users at risk to have their Facebook or Google accounts hijacked. More about IT Security The 20 biggest tech disasters of all time Interview with a hacker: S1ege from Ghost Squad Hackers Subscribe to TechRepublic's Cybersecurity Insider newsletter That's around 250 top apps, accounting for over one billion downloads on Android alone. Chances are good there's at least one on your device, and the flaw is platform agnostic. The cause of the vulnerability OAuth 2.0 works basically like this: A user inputs their SSO account details, and the app checks with Google or Facebook to see if that information is correct. Once the identity provider verifies the user gave correct info it sends back a login token, which the app then uses to sign the user in. SEE: Android Security Bulletin October 2016: What you need to know (TechRepublic) Over half of the apps are verifying the validity of the signature the Google or Facebook server sends back, but that 41% mentioned above isn't. When that's the case there's no way for the app to know if a username and password combination are legitimate. The discovery of this serious and widespread flaw is thanks to the work of three researchers at The Chinese University of Hong Kong: Ronghai Yang, Wing Cheong Lau, and Tianyu Liu. The research team set up a server to spoof logins by doing the following: A compromised app was installed on an Android device. An attacker signs into the app using their own legitimate Google or Facebook login. Using an ssl-enabled-MITM proxy the attacker substitutes their user ID with the victims after receiving authentication for their own login. The MITM proxy server forwards the modified login token to the app, and the attacker gains full access to the victim's profile. What's at risk The potential fallout from this exploit is huge. Many of the affected apps store user profile data in the cloud, and when a newly installed app is logged into, all the user's data is open for the taking. The paper, which you can read at Forbes, doesn't mention any affected apps, so we're left to speculate as to what could happen. Attackers could perform in-app purchases, book hotels, buy products—essentially any app you have installed that uses SSO could potentially be used against you. SEE: 10 do's and don'ts for securing your Android device (TechRepublic) The paper's authors did reveal one bright spot: They've notified Google, Facebook, and other identity providers of the exploit, and they're working to take action with third-party developers to plug the holes. With nearly 250 known affected apps that could take some time—perhaps it's a good idea to consider not using SSO for a while. The research team are presenting their findings today at Black Hat Europe. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Single sign on protocol OAuth 2.0, common on Android and iOS, has a flaw which allows attackers to hijack user accounts. The problem affects over 41 percent of mobile apps using OAuth 2.0. The exploit is caused by third-party apps not verifying the ID data being sent back from Google, Facebook, and other SSO ID providers. This allows attackers to substitute legitimate logins with other usernames and gain access to those accounts.

I copied information from the WIPO pages, including the formatting of the Dates the patent was published and granted: I copied those dates into my post in exactly the same formatting found on the WIPO site DD/MM/YY instead of the way dates are formatted in the US MM/DD/YY: It appears that Google decided that it should take a lesson from the context of my blog post, and read the date of my post using DD/MM/YY instead of MM/DD/YY: Which answers the question that Dan asked about why Google decided that the date in the snippet should be April 10, 2016 instead of the date that it was actually published October 4, 2016. Google may have paid more attention to the context of date formatting than it possibly should have in that post. It does show that Google is paying attention to context, though. There were some others involved in a discussion of this anomaly this morning, and I wanted to give a shout-out to them for getting involved (thanks!): Aymen Loukil Steven Weldler Tylor Hermanson I’m not sure if it will help much, but I have changed the Formatting of the patent dates in the post about context vectors to the Americanized format of MM/DD/YY. Google is still showing a snippet date of April 10, 2016. Aymen Loukil suggested I try using DateTime Schema. It looks like that is aimed at providing information regarding sites that provide schedules, and Schema.org tells us that it is used on “Between 10 and 100 domains”. Nothing on that page seemed to explain how to explain the formatting used by Dates. Funny to learn about how Google might use context to format a snippet date based upon how the post the snippet is about may format dates within it. I decided to write about Dan’s question and its answer to keep it in mind and learn from it (I suspect we won’t see a patent just about how Google decides upon how to format dates in snippets. I’ve written some other posts about patents from the WIPO pages, and used the European formatting of dates from those. I should go back and look at the snippet dates Google may have given those… Facebook52 Twitter154 Google+15 LinkedIn105 Pinterest2 328shares Related Post navigation Previous PostGoogle Patents Context Vectors to Improve SearchNext PostKnowledge Panels in Site Audits 32 thoughts on “Learning SEO by Looking at Anomalies” Aaron Bradley says: 10/05/2016 at 11:39 am Hey Bill, FWIW I declare my blog posts to be of type schema.org/Article and then provide datePublished and dateModified in ISO 8601 date format (as per schema.org/Date). Google’s seems to understand this pretty well (though I’m not sure if it favors this structured data over in-post dates). Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:06 pm Hi Aaron, Thanks. I’m not sure I even thought about whether or not the formatting of the dates I included in my post from yesterday would influence the formatting of the snippet date that Google showed for my blog post. I have now learned that Google does pay attention to information like that, which is why I am sharing the information. We can see that Google may pay attention to the dates that are shown on a post, but might ignore the country of origin of the post when deciding upon the date format to use to interpret when those in-post dates actually refer to, if the post refers to dates that are formatted differently. I probably need to find other posts I’ve written that have included WIPO patent information, and see if the snippet dates showing for those also uses european formatting in snippets for those posts. If I had a site that published schedules for transit, I would probably want to find a way to format dates so that I was certain that Google understood the formatting I was using. Snippet dates, though? I wrote and published the post yesterday, which wasn’t April 10, 2016; I didn’t expect Google to change the date format that it had been using for most other posts on my site because I didn’t change the formatting of the dates I received from WIPO. Now I understand the risk of not doing so. 🙁 Maybe including the Structured Data information in addition to the in-post dates may be a good idea. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:39 pm Hi Aaron, Thinking about this again, I wonder if I had the right structured data, and included European formatted dates from WIPO in my post if Google would choose the formatting it sees in the post over the information it sees in structured data. I don’t know which it would choose. California is a long way from Europe, so I don’t know why they decided to use european formatting. Cliff Sarcona says: 10/05/2016 at 3:40 pm Question: What exactly does this say about Google’s ability to track content within context? Would you say it proves that contextual backlinks are given more weight then say a random link posted without any content, or a link thrown in a side bar? Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 4:06 pm Hi Cliff, Thank you for sharing your questions. This patent describes a process by which a search engine can better index content found on the Web and assign contextual meanings to terms or phrases or words based upon finding those in a knowledge base such as an online encyclopedia, and assign a weight to the term(s) based upon how often it shows up in such sources. The combination of the contextual meanings (from different subject matter domains) and weights applied to those meanings is referred to as a “Context Vector.” The patent isn’t about links or backlinks, and doesn’t refer to contextual backlinks at all, so comparing it to a random link or a link in a sidebar isn’t a consideration here at all. The idea behind this patent is to better index content found on the web, and to apply contexts to queries when searches are performed to make it more likely that a searcher finds what they are looking for. Viva Traffic says: 10/05/2016 at 4:55 pm Out of curiosity, does a post with earlier dates typically rank higher? For example, 2012 vs a 2016 post, will the 2016 post rank higher being that its newer information, or is that not factored in with seo? Rasmita Sahoo says: 10/06/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help a lot of beginners like me. Thanks Again. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 4:13 pm Hi Rasmita, You’re welcome. If you do see something odd in Google’s search results. and you can capture a screen shot of it, do so. And then ask about it, in places like Twitter. It is a good way to learn. Sometimes you can catch Google experimenting on something, and it’s good to see that happening, too. Andrew says: 10/08/2016 at 11:27 am Interesting to see how Google really drills down to content/context and not just url/title/description/H1. Really need to be on your toes while writing anything these days! Bill Slawski says: 10/08/2016 at 6:07 pm Hi Andrew, It is interesting seeing how Google can get a sense of the meanings of words on pages, and the context of those words. If what you write is about something, in a particular context, it should be easier for Google to find it. I’m liking the idea of context vectors.

Alnoor Verjee says: 10/24/2016 at 3:51 pm Hi Bill, quick question – do you think implementing a date time schema would help in ranking newer content in any way or is it just for context purposes? Bill Slawski says: 10/26/2016 at 12:42 pm Hi Alnoor, I don’t think that a date/time schema would solve the problem I have with the format of the date the post was published being read wrong by Google. It probably doesn’t have any impact on the rankings of that page either. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:42 pm Hello Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help me a lot. Thanks you.

Cristina Sliva says: 11/10/2016 at 1:47 am Thanks for sharing this blog, This blog is very useful for everyone. keep it on. Flypa says: 11/10/2016 at 2:00 am Does that mean if I publish a post in 2013 and update it in 2016, will that post show up higher in search results? Great post once again. Thanks Bill Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:00 am Hi Flypa, No, changing the dates on post that you made shouldn’t have any effect on the rankings of those posts. However, if Google notices that a post you wrote in the past starts getting a lot of new links pointed to it, it might take those new links as a sign that people are interested in the content of your post, and might consider it timely or evergreen. Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:02 am Hi Cristina, Thank you for your kind words – Good hearing that people are getting value from my posts.

Since last winter, the Munich-based company has been powering Google hotel scores for search and maps where TrustYou finds a match between its hotel database and Google’s hotel database — that’s about 300,000 hotels. (When there isn’t a match, Google shows its Google Score.)* Update: Aug. 18: This article has been updated with corrections to some of the nuances of the TrustYou Stars platform and the Google partnership. A few quotes and the headline (“…and it isn’t afraid of TripAdvisor”) have been clarified to prevent a possibly misleading impression that TrustYou is competing with TripAdvisor when, in fact, it is a pure B2B play that styles itself “the Switzerland of reviews” and is a great partner with TripAdvisor when it comes to its reputation management software. TrustYou says that, for hotels that have begun to use its TrustYou Stars platform, which rolled out this year, on average, 75% of new hotel reviews on Google now come via the platform. The Stars tool expands the volume and reach of the hotel review data which can be seen on Google, Kayak, Skyscanner, and Wego. The company’s software also identifies review content from Expedia Inc and Priceline Group brands and analyzes that data, too. It mainly only excludes reviews from TripAdvisor, the user-reviews giant. Looking ahead, TrustYou thinks it can thrive, despite competition from rival reputation management companies, such as Revinate and ReviewPro, and guest survey companies like Medallia. Earlier this summer, TrustYou acquired Checkmate, a real-time messaging specialist for hotels to communicate with guests, for an undisclosed sum. We recently checked in with Benjamin Jost, chief executive and co-founder of TrustYou, to find out how his company plans to ride an expected wave of hotel investment in online reputation management. Jost outlined his belief that Google and other players will increasingly challenge TripAdvisor’s dominance in reviews. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. Tnooz: Nothing personal, but hotel general managers, when they proverbially wake up at three o’clock in the morning, they’re worried about their TripAdvisor score, not their TrustYou score. Is TrustYou just never going to be able to compete with the giant that is TripAdvisor? Jost: TripAdvisor has built a great brand. No one competes with that overnight. With more and more eyeballs on our data, especially with the launch on Google, we do see more and more hotels caring about the TrustScore, too. I would say we just started with the past year, when the Google deal actually launched. Separately, we are great partners with TripAdvisor when it comes to our reputation management software, where we license their review data. We do show TripAdvisor ratings and reviews to hotels, because hotels NEED to see that and respond to that. Tnooz: Every hotel seems to have a sticker saying it is rated on TripAdvisor. TrustYou for years had has a quality symbol, but not as many hotels tell guests about that. Is TrustYou going to be stuck in second place next to TripAdvisor? Jost: No. As an analogy, take J.D. Power, which does customer satisfaction surveys in the States. It’s an example of where you have a third-party, non-competing brand, very popular amongst users because it’s trustworthy, and it becomes more and more popular. It’s not competing with anyone. We have a good chance of being a kind of J.D. Power for the travel industry. We’ve seen other industries have a player like that rise up. Why not in travel? TripAdvisor is, to a certain extent, at cross-purposes with the hotels in how it markets its metasearch tool and mobile app as a consumer entry point. I’m not judging. But because TrustYou is not competing for consumer attention, we’re a very, very easy choice for hotels… We can show that if you improve your score, you increase conversion on these metasearch sites. There’s a payoff to the investment. Plus, we offer a product tuned to hotel needs. To get technical, we give them control. A hotel can take our data and say, “I want to display my entire ranking relative to all hotels in my city. Or just based on the best-ranked family hotels. Or, I want to rank it on the best boutique hotels. Or I want a ranking on the hotels with the best bar.” We’re not competing with anyone… That’s a different positioning. Tnooz: How will the reputation management landscape look three or five years from now? Jost: Ideally, every hotel will use our services when it comes to guest feedback, for collecting and analyzing it. That means putting guest feedback on their own brand.com site and app, for instance, with our tools. Tnooz: The mix of unverified and verified reviews on TripAdvisor still seems to have the most power and momentum and scale. Jost: All this talk about verified, unverified…. It’s the user who will decide what kind of data point they trust or not. Apparently, they trust the TripAdvisor data point very much even though we, as the industry, say that some of those reviews are unverified. The user, for most of the part, doesn’t care. It’s less about the verified/unverified debate, and it’s more about who drives the booking…. Tnooz: You agree that hotels care more about TripAdvisor than Google these days, when it comes to reviews? Jost: That’s fair, yes. But that will change. My assumption is that Google is going to become a very dominant player that is going to provide a huge amount of leads throughout the funnel, be it directly to brand.com or through the intermediaries. It is going to be a central starting point in the travel journey, more and more. Google is in a great position because it never steals any SEO power from the hotels. The hotel can plug in the review content it has collected via the Stars platform, and that would never count as duplicate content, even though you would find the same review as a Google Review on Google. It’s an advantage because all the other players out there, they need this SEO power. They need the unique content piece. Everyone is competing against each other, and the only one who is really not competing in that game is Google, because they’re the entrance point of search and inspiration. We also don’t compete with anyone because we don’t need to. We are a pure B2B play. We are the Switzerland of review analysis and reputation management. Tnooz: You seem to be saying there’s going to be a tipping point where hotels will realize your TrustScore has a huge impact. Jost: Yes, but more broadly… Despite your questions, I’m not so worried about when we’ll surpass TripAdvisor. Your framing is wrong: It’s not a zero-sum game. For one reason, using our platform to improve your scores on non-TripAdvisor ratings will usually also help your TripAdvisor ones, too. It’s simple logic. If a service improvement helps raise your TrustYou scores, it will logically also help your TripAdvisor rating, too. We’re going to have a huge impact on the TripAdvisor score indirectly because we can still tell you, “Hey, fix your cold coffee problem that you have in your breakfast room because people are complaining about it.” Once you fix it, you are going to see an increase in your scores across the board. One other thing: We do let a hotel analyze the TripAdvisor channel through our analytics. We just don’t take that channel’s reviews into account when we calculate our review summaries. Hotel marketers will recognize us as a force that drives booking on scale. If they don’t recognize us today, they will. If you count all of them together, Kayak, Google, Skyscanner — how many eyeballs do we have on our data? We may have more eyeballs on our data soon than are on TripAdvisor’s. Our winning model is our focus on B2B, on helping the hotel figure out the most effective ways to improve their product. Tnooz: Thanks. Different topic, please. Why acquire Checkmate? Jost: We wanted to be everywhere on the traveler journey when it comes to guest feedback…. Collecting information from the guest via mobile devices as the guest is about to arrive and during their stay was the last piece of the journey we didn’t haven’t well covered. Tnooz: If Checkmate was so great, why did it have to be a distressed asset sale? Meaning, why is this a good acquisition for you? Jost: I can answer generally. Take Expedia. It was an investor in Checkmate, and in Alice, another messaging service. That shows that this segment is still very hot and is at the very beginning. Tnooz: Why will one solution win and another won’t? Jost: It’s going to boil down to execution. How do you build a sales force and execute on marketing effectively. We have at least a good head start in that because we’ve done that sales and marketing work already for other services and we can now plug in this product to all of our customers. We’ve received a lot of positive reaction when we told our customers we’re adding this messaging tech…. You see all these technology stack players. They build a management tool and they want to add a CRM on top and they build some other BI on top and they want to sell this entire technology stack to hotels. We only want to focus on guest feedback….It’s a clearer sales pitch. Tnooz: Isn’t it hard to scale up with independent hotels, with lots of small, one-off deals? Jost: Yes, it’s probably much harder to sell to an independent hotel because the sales cost is higher compared to, “Hey, I just signed Accor,” and 4,000 sales come on board immediately. We don’t have a particularly pure independent sales strategy. We don’t have a particularly pure enterprise sales strategy. We see both as important. With independent hotels, you have to be very effective in your sales approach there, and you have to measure really well how it works. That’s what we’ve been doing. Our team knows today how it works. We know the metrics. We know the funnel. Now we can start to scale that business in the independent hotel sector. Tnooz: How big is your client list? Jost: These numbers everyone is throwing around … Everyone’s saying, “Ah, we’re 50,000 properties. We’re 30,000 properties.” Whatever. I would always say, it depends how you look at it. We are less reliant on a few large chain deals than some competitors. When we say 50,000 hotels worldwide use us for one of our services, we mean we have some of these hotels looking at our data through different portals. We have a lot of hotels looking at our dashboards within a third-party tool or an extranet. For example, we help power the reputation tools on HRS and HolidayCheck. By the end of this year, we have a goal of having specifically 20,000 hotels that feed their own reviews into TrustYou’s guest feedback platform. We will also announce a couple of partnerships with bigger providers that build websites for hotels and that need content to help power brand.com websites or PMS players or CRM players that sit on the guest profile data. We may give them our Stars platform, our feedback platform, for all their hotels for free, so they can start collecting feedback and push it into the guest feedback platform with TrustYou. That’s good for scale. Tnooz: Could you tell us more about TrustYou Stars, your big product push of the year? Jost: Some context, first: We look at all reviews as guest feedback. Whether it is on an OTA or a review site or it is posts and comments on social, it’s guest feedback. We call it surveys when we look at operational procedures of the hotel. But it’s all guest feedback. Why do you want to look at this data feedback in different silos, as some competitor tools do? Why do you want a platform to look at social feedback, but not surveys. Why don’t you want to look at this all together because it’s all together guest feedback? We still let you slice and dice the information to compare and see trends. But we stand out for bringing all the feedback together in the single TrustYou Stars platform. We compete with Medallia, and we’re leaving it behind as the dinosaur in the industry when it comes to guest feedback operations. In 2015, we replaced Medallia for the entire Accor group for all their almost 4,000 hotels. We’ll continue to win big chains because, among other reasons, the TrustYou Stars platform has a sophisticated post-stay survey component. We say, “Hey, if you, at the end of your survey, as a traveler, you get to choose, do you want to push this review or this survey into Google as well and share it with all the other fellow travelers out there? Yes or No?” The traveler has the choice to say, “Yes, I want to share it.” If they say yes, we push it out on Google as a Google Review. This process is unleashing a huge force on behalf of hotels. About half of hotel guest feedback is hidden right now in some guest survey databases not accessible to the web. We say to them, Why don’t you make it public and we take it into account when we calculate your score? Suddenly they can do this, and they make the guest feedback public. It makes for a fuller picture of the stay experience. Now, especially after we fully integrate Checkmate, we’re everywhere guest feedback happens. In the search process, on the intermediary or on the brand.com site, on an app during a stay, and on the post-stay survey or on one of the review channels or be it on their own survey channel or an OTA’s. Our data is responsible for guiding booking decisions. Hotels are noticing.   Previous Article Next Article   About the Writer :: Sean O'Neill Sean O’Neill is Editor-in-Chief of Tnooz.

A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. One of the limitations of information on the Web is that it is organized differently at each site on the Web. As a newly granted Google patent notes, there is no official catalog of information available on the internet, and each site has its own organizational system. Search engines exist to index information, but they have issues, as described in this new patent that make finding information challenging. Limitations on Conventional Keyword-Based Search Engines The patent granted to Google, in September of 2016, discusses a way to organize information on the Web in a manner which can help to better organize and index that information, using context vectors to better understand how words are being used. The patent describes limitations of search engines that are based upon indexing content using keywords, such as: A search engine working with Conventional keyword searching will return all instances of the keyword being searched for, regardless of how that word is used on a site. This can be a lot of results Conventional search engines may only return only the home page of a site that contains the keyword. Finding where the keyword is used on the site could be difficult Often a conventional search engine will return a list of URLs in response to a keyword search that may be difficult to modify or search further in a meaningful manner. Information obtained through a search can become dated quickly. Such information may need to be checked up upon The patent tells us about those limitations and also points out some of the limitations of directories that could also be used to help find information. It then goes on to provide a possible solution to this problem, with a “data extraction tool” capable of providing many of the benefits of both search engines and directories, without the drawbacks that this patent points out. Is this The Google Search Engine with RankBrain Inside? A search engine based on a data extraction tool like the one described in the patent would be an improvement over most search engines. Is this Google’s search engine with RankBrain applied to it? It’s possible that it is, though it doesn’t use the word RankBrain The Bloomberg introduction to RankBrain, Google Turning Its Lucrative Web Search Over to AI Machines provides information about the algorithm used in RankBrain, and it tells us: RankBrain uses artificial intelligence to embed vast amounts of written language into mathematical entities — called vectors — that the computer can understand. This new patent refers to what it calls Context Vectors to index content about words found on the Web. To put it clearly, the patent tells us: In view of the foregoing, in accordance with the invention as embodied and broadly described herein, a method and apparatus are disclosed in one embodiment of the present invention for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When a search submits a query to a search engine, we are told that the search engine may try to give it contexts based upon “other queries from the same user, the query associated with other information or query results from the same use, or other inputs related to that user to give it more context. The patent is: User-context-based search engine Inventors: David C. Taylor Application Date: 09/04/2012 Grant Number: 09449105 Grant Date: 09/20/2016 Abstract: A method and apparatus for determining contexts of information analyzed. Contexts may be determined for words, expressions, and other combinations of words in bodies of knowledge such as encyclopedias. Analysis of use provides a division of the universe of communication or information into domains and selects words or expressions unique to those domains of subject matter as an aid in classifying information. A vocabulary list is created with a macro-context (context vector) for each, dependent upon the number of occurrences of unique terms from a domain, over each of the domains. This system may be used to find information or classify information by subsequent inputs of text, in calculation of macro-contexts, with ultimate determination of lists of micro-contests including terms closely aligned with the subject matter. When RankBrain was first announced, I found a patent that was co-invented by one of the members of the team that was working on it, that described how Google might provide substitutions for some query terms, based upon an understanding of the context of those terms and the other words used in a query. I wrote about that patent in the post, Investigating Google RankBrain and Query Term Substitutions. I think reading the patent that post is about, and the one that this post is about can be helpful in understanding some of the ideas behind a process such as RankBrain. This patent does provide a lot of insights in explaining the importance of context and how helpful that can be to a system that may be attempting to extract data from a source and index that data in a way which makes it easier to locate. I liked this passage in particular: Interestingly, some words in the English language, and other languages pertain to many different areas of subject matter. Thus, one may think of the universe of communication as containing numerous domains of subject matter. For example, the various domains in FIG. 2 refer to centers of meaning or subject matter areas. These domains are represented as somewhat indistinct clouds, in that they may accumulate a vocabulary of communication elements about them that pertain to them or that relate to them. Nevertheless, some of those same communication elements may also have application elsewhere. For example, a horse to a rancher is an animal. A horse to a carpenter is an implement of work. A horse to a gymnast is an implement on which to perform certain exercises. Thus, the communication element that we call “horse” belongs to, or pertains to, multiple domains. A search engine that can identify the domains or contexts that a word might fit within may be able to better index such words; as described in this patent: In an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention, a search engine process is developed that provides a deterministic method for establishing context for the communication elements submitted in a query. Thus, it is possible for a search engine now to determine to which domain or domains a communication element is “attracted.” Since few things are absolute, domains may actually overlap or be very close such that they man share certain communication elements. That is, communication elements do not “belong” to any domain, they are attracted to or have an affinity for various domains, and may have differing degrees of affinity for differing domains. One may think of this affinity as perhaps a goodness of fit or a best alignment or quality alignment with the subject matter of a particular domain. Contextually Rewarding Search Results The patent tells us that a search engine that works well is one that provides a searcher with information in response to a query that is “comparatively close related”. Information that is exactly what has been sought. Then information that is close to what has been sought and is still useful. Then it tells us that what would be “contextually unrewarding” would be information that shares the word in a completely different and useless context related to the query Words might be related to a wide range of particular fields or subject matter domains. The patent describes how these might be used: Typically, a domain list of about 40 to 50 terms have been found to be effective. Some domain lists have been operated successfully in an apparatus and method in accordance with the invention with as few as 10 terms. Some domain lists may contain a few hundreds of individual terms. For example, some domains may justify about 300 terms. Although the method is deterministic, rather than statistical, it is helpful to have about 40 to 50 terms in the domain list in order to improve the efficiency of the calculations and determinations of the method. The domain lists have utility in quickly identifying the particular domain to which their members pertain. This results from the lack of commonality of the terms and the lack of ambiguity as to domains to which they may have utility. By the same token, a list as small as the domain lists are necessarily limited when considering the overall vocabulary of communication elements available in any language. Thus, the terms in domain lists do not necessarily arise with the frequency that is most useful for rapid searching. That is, a word that is unique to a particular subject matter domain, but infrequently used, may not arise in very many queries submitted to a search engine. A process for creating a vocabulary list of a substantial universe or a substantial portion of a universe of communication elements may be performed by identifying a body or corpus of information organized by topical entries. Thereafter, the text of each of those entries identified may be subjected to a counting process in which occurrences of terms from the domain list occur within each of the topical entries. Ultimately, a calculation of a macro context may be made for each of the topical entries. This calculation is based on the domain lists, and the domains represented thereby. This is where this patent enters into the world of the Semantic Web. The places where different subject matter domains may be identified for different words could be in knowledge bases or online encyclopedias. Such collections of what is referred to as public knowledge might be called a “corpus”. This kind of corpus of information could be used to create a context vector used to index different meanings of words. When a different meaning is found, it might then be counted from that information corpus The patent tells us that terms found in such a place could be “individual words, terms, expressions, phrases, and so forth.” The patent attempts to put this into context for us with this statement: One may think of a topical entry as a vocabulary term. That is, every topical entry is a vocabulary word, expression, place, person, etc. that will be added to the overall vocabulary. That is, for example, the universe may be divided into about 100 to 120 domains for convenient navigation. Likewise, the domain lists may themselves contain from about 10 to about 300 select terms each. By contrast, the topical entries that may be included in the build of a vocabulary list may include the number of terms one would find in a dictionary such as 300 to 800,000. Less may be used, and conceivably more. Nevertheless, unabridged dictionaries and encyclopedias typically have on this order of numbers of entries. Contexts as Vectors When RankBrain first came out, there was a post published that looked at some information that might make it a little more understandable; it included some information about Geoffrey Hinton’s Thought Vectors, and there’s more about those in this post from Jennifer Slegg: RankBrain: Everything We Know About Google’s AI Algorithm. There is a Google Open Source Blog post on Word Vectors which is closely related, titled Learning the meaning behind words, written by Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, and Quoc Le. Ilya Sutskever was a student of Geoffry Hinton. Tomas Mikolov worked on a number of papers about word vectors while with the Google Brain team, including Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space. The patent spends a fair amount of time describing what it considers context vectors to be; the different domains which a word might fall into, and number of occurrences or weights for those words within those domains. It’s worth drilling down into the patent and reading about how terms can be considered context vectors that a search engine might label them as. When a searcher enters a query into a search engine to be searched, the query may be classified within contexts, to help in selecting information in response to that query. Using a Browser Helper Object The patent describes how it might identify different domains that might be associated with specific terms. It tells us that this might be done: By compiling a list of domain-specific questions, it is possible to (1) specify differences between very similar domains with great precision, and (2) create a rapid way to prototype a domain that does not require many hours of an expert’s time, and can be expanded by relatively inexperienced people. The patent also describes the use of a BHO (Browser Helper Object) in this manner: Another slightly more complex implementation is something like a Browser Helper Object (BHO) that runs on the user’s machine and watches/categorizes all surfing activity. With this system, even non-participating sites can contribute to the picture of the user, and any clicking the user does to ad sites served by certified clicks will pick up a much more comprehensive picture. The patent provides more details on how this contextual vector based system might work, and how data might be extracted from web pages. It is highly recommended reading if you want to get a better sense of how a context-based system might be used to index the web and to make specific information on the Web easier to improve upon most conventional keyword-based search engines.

Butler says: 10/05/2016 at 3:35 am The article is very interesting. They are starting to think more effectively about the process of understanding. Note; however, that they do not (and cannot) define context precisely. I am able to do this. It will be in my next post on Constants, Variances, and Identities. Note also how Google is also trying to set the precedent for patenting knowledge. This route will lead further to its own demise. This is wrong ethically, morally, and legally as well.﻿ Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 7:44 am Hi Carey, Thank you. It’s interesting seeing what Google is trying to do with the processes they’ve come up with to drive search. Trying to account for contexts seems to make sense. We’ll see where Google tries to take this next. Adam says: 10/05/2016 at 8:57 am Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! I am not sure which one I prefer? 😉 Derek says: 10/05/2016 at 10:20 am Thanks Bill, as always, for your vigilance and thorough patent analysis. I thought the BHO component and its role in disambiguation was one of the most interesting parts of the patent. It reflects how critical browser and email market share are to Google’s core search business, especially since that user data is proprietary and unavailable to competing search engines. It also justifies Google’s continued investment in other freeware like Sheets and Docs—anything that yields a logged-in user improves Google’s chances of returning a better result than Bing or DuckDuckGo. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:18 am Hi Adam, If you write about a topic, and provide enough facts and details so that a search engine can get a good sense of what your page is about (because it understands the context of your page) , I think that is an improvement over keyword stuffing or string matching of query terms with document terms. It’s good seeing Google making these kind of steps. Also good seeing that they are learning context from places such as knowledgebases, which makes indexing the web more about knowledge graphs. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 11:23 am Hi Derek, Thank you! The Browser Helper Object was interesting and definitely tied into presenting this approach as a data extraction tool approach. Learning from the context of a searcher’s query may be improved by understanding the search history, prior searches, and web page visits of searchers. A searcher’s use of things like Google+ can also provide helpful information about searchers to put the context of a search into better perspective as well. Robert says: 10/05/2016 at 11:51 pm The Browser Helper Object seems to be the logical continuation from using other factors such as search history or even click through rates. This would seem to be a kind of reverse engineering where Google would be able to now get a better idea of what you’re not doing? As in elements that aren’t drawing your interaction and as such determine that they aren’t a good match. An example of: sometimes knowing what doesn’t work is in itself knowledge of something. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 8:39 am Hi Robert, I think the BHO described in the patent would give Google a better idea of what you are doing, rather than what you aren’t doing. Riya Sharma says: 10/26/2016 at 11:25 pm Interesting…. Good to know that Google is not just keep sitting at its legacy Thanks for sharing such a informative article…. fernanda says: 11/02/2016 at 11:51 am It´s Nice. Great stuff Bill! Shows how far we have come from keyword stuffing as an effective method of ranking a page to this new level of sophistication! Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:31 am Thanks, Fernanda. It does make searches smarter by better understanding the meanings of words based upon their context. Bill Slawski says: 11/03/2016 at 8:33 am Thank you Riya, I was happy when I found this patent and read through it, because it does describe an interesting approach from Google.

Sprint users with Android devices are in for a texting upgrade. Google on Friday announced that it's teaming up with Sprint to launch Rich Communications Services messaging to the carrier's customers using Android devices, starting today. RCS promises features like group chat, high-resolution photo sharing, read receipts, and advanced calling. This move makes Sprint the first carrier to support the new messaging experience. Sprint customers can check out the new features inside the Google-developed Messenger app for Android devices. Those using select LG and Nexus phones from Sprint don't have to do anything to get the update: it will be pushed to handsets automatically. Subscribers using other Android devices can download Messenger from the Play Store. //Related Articles Google, Global Carriers Team Up to Improve Text Messaging Next year, all new Android devices from Sprint will come with Messenger for Android preloaded as the default texting app. "We're excited to see this first launch of RCS come to life, providing a better carrier messaging experience for millions of people in the US," Google's Head of Rich Communication Services, Amir Sarhangi, wrote in a blog post. "We look forward to launching RCS with more partners in the coming months." At this point, more than 58 carriers and manufacturers covering 4.7 billion people around the world have committed to supporting a "single, standard implementation of RCS," Sarhangi added. Besides Sprint, that list includes América Móvil, Bharti Airtel Ltd, Deutsche Telekom, Etisalat, Globe Telecom, KPN, Millicom, MTN, Orange, PLAY, Smart Communications, Telenor Group, TeliaSonera, Telstra, TIM, Turkcell, VimpelCom, and Vodafone.

Welcome to Wyandotte Daily! Serving Kansas City (Wyandotte County) Kansas for over 45 years! News Weather Sports Sporting KC T-Bones Business About Wyandotte Daily Communities Wyandotte County Kansas City Kansas Piper Bonner Springs Leavenworth Overland Park Kansas City Missouri Opinions Calendar Events Faith Employment NewzAdz Internet comes to KCK public housing November 4, 2016 Mary Rupert Communities, Kansas City Kansas, News 0 Residents of the Cyrus K. Holliday public housing complex in Kansas City, Kan., got more information about the Internet and signed up for service at an event on Wednesday. (Staff photo) by Mary Rupert Spanning the digital divide takes the effort of more than one group in Wyandotte County. On Wednesday, residents of a public housing complex in Kansas City, Kan., signed up for Internet service with help from Google Fiber, Connecting for Good and the Surplus Exchange. One resident of the Cyrus K. Holliday public housing complex at 1750 S. 37th Court in Kansas City, Kan., who signed up for the Internet on Wednesday said it will be very helpful for the children to do their homework at home. Sometimes their homework involves accessing the Internet, she said. Rachel Merlo, Google Fiber community impact manager, said Google Fiber has worked with the Kansas City, Kan., Public Housing Authority to identify families with kindergarten through 12th grade children to help them close the homework gap – where they don’t have access to the Internet at home. Rachel Merlo, Google Fiber community impact manager, said this is an effort to help families with kindergarten through 12th grade children help close the homework gap. (Staff photo) At the same time, there are benefits for adults, such as access to job postings, Merlo said. In serving similar communities in Kansas City, Mo., since February, they have already seen residents using the Internet to find a job, to find a car to go to the job, and to make child care arrangements, Merlo said. One resident is now going to school and will be able to use the Internet in her adult education, Merlo said. Some residents are just figuring out how to use computers and the Internet to stay in touch with friends and family, and some have tried video conferencing. While many families already have a smart phone, this program is partnering with nonprofit organizations to bring low-cost, refurbished devices such as a laptop or desktop computer to do some of the more highly involved tasks, such as a job search, Merlo said. The organizations also provide them with free training. Merlo said she would love to see all the residents of the 60 units in the Cyrus Holliday complex sign up for the free service. Often there is a lot of excitement at the beginning for the service, then followed by more signups later. There sometimes is skepticism from people who wonder if it is really free and think that they might be billed later, so she said Google and the organizations work to build trust in the community. Merlo said two more Housing Authority properties, including Chalet Manor, will come on line this year. There are plans to connect a total of seven Housing Authority sites in Kansas City, Kan., eventually, according to Connecting for Good. Tom Esselman, CEO of Connecting for Good, said a combination of available Internet connectivity, computer devices and training were offered at the housing site on Wednesday. All three have to go together for people to improve their lives through the technology, he said. Connecting for Good tries to take the emphasis away from the technology and more toward life improvement, he said. Esselman said the organization helps with education skills, career skills and life skills. “So much of our world is digitalized any more, that for people who live in low-income diverse areas, many of them have not even had access to those skills,” he said. “Now that they have the access, we want to make sure that they are able to take advantage of them,” he said. Connecting for Good provides free training classes, he said, and it provides some used computers and equipment on a smaller scale. Surplus Exchange does recycling of computers on a larger scale, he added. In Wyandotte County, Connecting for Good works with Workforce Partners, he said. Connecting for Good trains people on how to refurbish and work with computers. Interns refurbish computers, then the computers are made available to That allows the organization to make computers available for $50 or $75, prices that some low-income people can afford, he said. The organization has been doing this program for four years, he added. “People get more use out of equipment that they have had to pay money for,” he said. “They feel that they have bought into it.” It also helps Connecting for Good, a small not-for-profit, offset some of its costs, he added. “We partner in every Housing Authority site,” Esselman said. Google Fiber provides the connectivity, Surplus Exchange provides the hardware, with some help from Connecting for Good, and Connecting for Good provides the training, he added. The Kansas City, Kan., Housing Authority is also a partner, has provided a location for Connecting for Good at Juniper Gardens, and supports the ability of these organizations to do the work, he added. “It opens up whole new worlds for them,” Esselman said.

SUBSCRIBE Google begins mobile-first indexing, using mobile content for all search rankings While called an 'experiment,' it’s actually the first move in Google's planned shift to looking primarily at mobile content, rather than desktop, when deciding how to rank results. Barry Schwartz on November 4, 2016 at 12:00 pm More Kashin / Shutterstock.com Google has begun testing its mobile-first index, which will primarily look at the mobile version of your website for its ranking signals and fall back on the desktop version when there is no mobile version. We expected this was coming and even heard about it over a year ago, but this is the first time Google has posted details about the mobile-first index on their own blog. Most of Google searches are mobile, but Google’s index is desktop Google explained that it sees more mobile searches than desktop searches on a daily basis. But when Google looks to evaluate a page’s ranking in Google, it currently looks at the desktop version of the site — an issue we pointed out over a year ago. To fix this, Google will look at the content, links and structured data of the mobile version of your site if one is available. Google wrote: To make our results more useful, we’ve begun experiments to make our index mobile-first. Although our search index will continue to be a single index of websites and apps, our algorithms will eventually primarily use the mobile version of a site’s content to rank pages from that site, to understand structured data, and to show snippets from those pages in our results. Of course, while our index will be built from mobile documents, we’re going to continue to build a great search experience for all users, whether they come from mobile or desktop devices. With this change, Google will primarily index mobile content and use that to decide how to rank its results, regardless of whether you’re on desktop or mobile. There will no longer be any type of “mobile-friendly” adjustment done just for mobile users. Effectively, if you’re not mobile-friendly, that will have an impact even on how you appear for desktop searchers Google is testing this but hopes to roll it out to all Google said it has started this experiment and will “continue to carefully experiment over the coming months on a small scale.” Google will “ramp up this change when we’re confident that we have a great user experience.” No mobile site? Don’t worry Those who do not have a mobile version of their website do not need to worry. Google will just use the desktop version to rank the site. Google wrote, “[I]f you only have a desktop site, we’ll continue to index your desktop site just fine, even if we’re using a mobile user agent to view your site.” This also means that if you have a responsive site, one that dynamically changes content depending on desktop or mobile device, there’s nothing special you need to do. Of course, if you do not have a mobile site, you won’t benefit from the mobile-friendly ranking boost. But that is separate from this mobile index news. How can you prepare? Here are some recommendations Google is giving webmasters to prepare for the change: If you have a responsive site or a dynamic serving site where the primary content and markup is equivalent across mobile and desktop, you shouldn’t have to change anything. If you have a site configuration where the primary content and markup is different across mobile and desktop, you should consider making some changes to your site. Make sure to serve structured markup for both the desktop and mobile version. Sites can verify the equivalence of their structured markup across desktop and mobile by typing the URLs of both versions into the Structured Data Testing Tool and comparing the output. When adding structured data to a mobile site, avoid adding large amounts of markup that isn’t relevant to the specific information content of each document. Use the robots.txt testing tool to verify that your mobile version is accessible to Googlebot. Sites do not have to make changes to their canonical links; we’ll continue to use these links as guides to serve the appropriate results to a user searching on desktop or mobile. If you are a site owner who has only verified your desktop site in Search Console, please add and verify your mobile version. We will keep you posted As we see changes to the Google results and index, we will report back to you with any issues. When this mobile-first index fully rolls out, we will let you all know.

Toggle Navigation A-   A+ Sign in News   Stock Home «Back Amazon India's most attractive Internet brand: TRA study Press Trust of India | New Delhi Nov 04, 2016 10:07 PM IST US-based online retailer Amazon has been ranked as the most attractive Internet brand in the country ahead of rivals Flipkart and Snapdeal as well as search engine giant Google, according to India's Most Attractive Brands Study 2016. "For the first time in three years, Amazon has been declared as the most attractive Internet brand (96th rank overall)...," said the study carried out by Trust Research Advisory (TRA). Google emerged as the second-most attractive Internet brand in the country while its overall ranking was 102. The study was based on primary research conducted on close to 3,000 consumers across 16 cities. Flipkart grabbed the third position in the Internet category, jumping 221 slots to 125th rank across India, while Snapdeal saw an improvement of 63 ranks to 302nd on the list. Social networking giant Facebook rose 202 ranks in the national rankings to 157th position in 2016, and was placed fourth in the category, the study said. "The Internet category has seen a surprising shift in the top ranks, with Amazon ranking higher than Google, implying a serious improvement in the appeal of conducting transactions online," TRA Chief Executive Officer N Chandramouli said. This is apparent from the fact that out of the 29 brands listed in the Internet category in 2016, 11 brands were online retailers, he added. "Expected brands like Shopclues (461 rank) and Uber (483) were listed in the Internet category along with some surprising entrants like Koovs (477), Voonik (937) and Oyo Rooms (948)," he said. The list was topped by Korean electronics giant LG while the Tata conglomerate slipped in ranking to the seventh spot this year (from 5 in 2014 and 4 in 2015).

It paid tax of €47.8m. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Simon Bowers @sbowers00 Friday 4 November 2016 15.18 EDT Last modified on Friday 11 November 2016 06.22 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Google’s controversial advertising sales business in Dublin earned revenues of €22.6bn (£20.1bn) from Europe, the Middle East and Africa last year but paid just €47.8m in tax, according to company filings in Ireland. Revenues at Google Ireland Limited rose 23% in 2015, to €22.6bn, and were equivalent to a third of the search group’s global income. Of this Irish income, more than $7bn (£5.6bn) is thought to have come from transactions with advertisers in the UK. Google has continued to route its sales from British advertisers through Ireland, despite efforts by the former UK chancellor George Osborne to crack down on multinational tech groups that “abused the trust of the British people”. Google Ireland Limited is one half of the search group’s so-called “double Irish” tax structure. Although Google reported booming revenues, its taxable profits were only €341m. This profit figure was small in large part because the company had to meet administrative expenses of €16.9bn. These expenses are thought to be dominated by royalty fees paid to other Google subsidiaries – income which eventually makes its way to a business called Google Holdings Ireland, the second company in Google’s “double Irish” structure. European commission to resurrect overarching corporate tax proposals Read more Almost no information is made public about Google Holdings Ireland, which is an unlimited company. It is registered to the address of a law firm in Dublin, but is thought to pay no tax in Ireland as it is tax-resident in Bermuda. Because it is unlimited, Google Holdings Ireland is not required to file accounts, under Irish company law. However, Bermuda does not charge corporation tax, so the billions of dollars of income Google is able to move into Google Holdings Ireland each year go untaxed. Google has told investors that, at the end of last year, it had amassed an offshore cash pile of $42.9bn. Other US tech companies that have made use of “double Irish” tax avoidance structures include Facebook, Microsoft and Apple. Under pressure from world leaders, Ireland agreed two years ago to start phasing out the tax benefits of such structures. However, Irish ministers have awarded generous “grandfathering rights” which ensure Google and others are able to pour income into their offshore tax havens up until 2020. Google, which is ultimately owned by the holding company Alphabet Inc, insists it’s business in Ireland are much more than a tax structure. At the end of last year, Google Ireland Limited employed 2,763 staff, an increase of 6% in 12 months. “As Google grows, Ireland continues to benefit,” said Ronan Harris, who is shortly moving from Ireland to lead Google operations in the UK. “In 2015 we opened our second data centre, bringing total investment in capital assets in Ireland to over €750m.” Ahead of the UK election in 2015, George Osborne promised to stop tech firms routing sales from customers in Britain to gateway jurisdictions, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, from where income can then be easily transferred to offshore tax havens. As UK chancellor, Osborne introduced a new punitive tax, known as the diverted profits tax, which he said would hit companies found to be artificially shifting UK income overseas. It later emerged, however, that while some companies, such as Amazon and Facebook, said they would change their ways, others – including Google and eBay – have continued to book UK sales overseas. In January, UK tax inspectors reached a £130m tax settlement with Google over taxes stretching back 10 years. Osborne initially heralded as a “major success”, though many others condemned it as too lenient. Separately, Google has promised significant investment in the UK, which some tax campaigners fear may have been a factor in the minds of those at HMRC reaching the settlement. A more serious challenge to the “double Irish” tax avoidance method – or at least the most significant instance of it – came from European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager. In August she ruled that Apple’s long-standing tax arrangements in Ireland relied on illegal state aid. As a result, the Irish government would have to collect €13bn in back taxes from the iPhone maker, she said.

DESIGN Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Slack Designers Explain the Art of Creating Smart A.I. Bots Here's how artificial intelligence should look and behave, according to leaders in the tech industry. By Kevin J. Ryan Kevin J. Ryan is a reporter for Inc. He has written for ESPN The Magazine and the Long Island Press and contributed to Mental Floss. He lives in Queens, New York. @wheresKR Reporter, Inc.@wheresKR WRITE A COMMENT Google's Pixel phone, which includes Google Assistant. CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement Siri--and all her artificially intelligent peers--are increasingly taking on more tasks for people at home and at work. But as impressive as these digital assistants can be, they're still very much in their infancy. "I don't think anyone has nailed the user experience yet," warns Jason Cornwell, who leads the team at Google tasked with designing exactly that. Still, the biggest players in artificial intelligence (A.I.) agree on some important design lessons. Cornwell shared a stage with execs from Slack, Facebook, and Microsoft on Thursday at Fast Company's Innovation Festival in New York City. The group discussed what each respective company has learned about what works--and what doesn't--when building consumer-focused, A.I.-based products. Here's what the panelists had to say: 1. A.I. should add to the conversation... Electronic assistants can be extremely useful at saving people time on menial tasks. But to become a can't-live-without tool, an assistant "needs to be interesting enough to add to a group conversation," says Lili Cheng, general manager of Microsoft's Future Social Experiences labs. In other words, the A.I. needs its own personality, instead of being purely reactive. That necessary extra bit of oomph is why Google has hired a team of comedy writers from places like The Onion and Pixar to write dialogue for Google Assistant. 2. ...But it shouldn't be intrusive. Whether it's a friend, an overbearing presidential candidate, or a computer, nobody likes an interrupter. The group agrees that if A.I. is part of a conversation, it shouldn't butt in out of turn; if it's on a computer or phone, it shouldn't take over your screen or dismiss whatever you're working on. A small pop-up that can be addressed in a moment will suffice. It's a delicate balance, but an important one. 3. A.I. should feel natural. "If we're going to spend our lives around these things," Cheng says, "they should be designed around the way we naturally talk." For example, the back button on a browser is useful, but users will (rightly) have higher expectations for something they converse with out loud--so saying "back" to get to a previous option won't fly. Exchanges should flow like regular conversation. 4. It should be clear about what it's doing and what it's capable of. Several years ago, Gmail introduced a feature that automatically sorted mail into "important" and "unimportant" folders. The A.I. was very accurate, Cornwell says, but users weren't comfortable letting a computer make those decisions if they didn't know the criteria it was using. So Google applied that very same A.I. in a different way, sorting mail into folders based on work, personal, spam, etc.--and users loved it. Similarly, an A.I. system should set expectations: If users expect a digital assistant to be all-knowing and it turns out not to be, they'll be disappointed. Slack's chatbot, meant to serve as an office assistant, lets you know its limitations when it doesn't understand something: "Sometimes I have an easier time with a few simple keywords." 5. Creators need to be aware of any biases. "Artificial intelligence is only as smart as the data you feed it," Cheng says. As such, A.I. will reflect the biases of the information it reads. Microsoft learned a tough lesson about this when it created Tay, a chatbot that quickly began spewing racist and profane answers back at the Twitterverse after some users taught it to do just that. Much of the time, the prejudices won't be so obvious. They might reflect slight biases based on the region, culture, gender, or likes and dislikes of the person who created it. It's important to keep this in mind when creating something intended to be used by a wide audience. In general, the more input, the better--but keep a watchful eye on it.

Why did the search giant team up with the 800-pound gorilla of accounting software? Leo Sun (TMFSunLion) Nov 4, 2016 at 2:05PM Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google recently announced a new partnership with finance software giant Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) to link their cloud ecosystems together. Google will integrate its recently rebranded cloud business platform, G Suite, with the cloud-based version of Intuit's QuickBooks accounting software. QuickBooks Online. Image source: Google Play. The two platforms will be united with a single sign-on, and data will be freely shared between the apps. From now on, G Suite subscribers can schedule tasks and meetings through Google Calendar, and those appointments will be automatically displayed in Quickbooks. This eliminates the need for users to manually enter each appointment in Quickbooks again, which also makes it easier for businesses to invoice their time. With a single sign-on, employees won't need separate credentials to access Quickbooks -- they can simply use their Google login. How does this partnership help Google? Google has been trying to beef up its cloud-based enterprise tools to compete more effectively against Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That's why Google recently rebranded its Google Apps for Work portfolio (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Google+, Calendar, Hangouts, and Forms) as G Suite. G Suite is now a core component of the new "Google Cloud", which includes the Google Cloud Platform, enterprise versions of Android and Chrome OS, and its APIs for machine learning and enterprise mapping services. That reorganization provides companies with a big bundle of cloud services which not only counters Office, but also targets Windows and Azure. Google claims that its Cloud Platform now has over a billion users, putting it in the same league as Android, Chrome, Gmail, Maps, Search, and YouTube. But despite Google's best efforts, many companies still gravitate toward Microsoft's services due to the familiarity of Office and Windows' support for legacy software. Back in February, research firm Gartner reported that just over 13% of publicly listed companies used Office 365 or Google Apps for email. Within that total, 8.5% used Office 365, while just 4.7% used Google Apps for Work. The remainder used on-premises, hybrid, hosted, or private cloud email solutions hosted by smaller vendors. Since QuickBooks is one of the world's top accounting software brands, its integration into G Suite could certainly make Google's subscription options more appealing. It also strikes at a weak link in Microsoft's ecosystem, since the Outlook Calendar and QuickBooks can't be seamlessly linked in a similar way yet. How does this partnership help Intuit? Intuit VP Vinay Pai called the deal "the beginning of an exciting collaboration between Intuit and Google that will deliver huge benefits for the millions of small businesses that we serve around the world." Pai claims that 56% of QuickBooks customers are already using Google Calendar "to book appointments, schedule meetings, and track client work." He also notes that partnering with Google "will create important efficiencies between two solutions customers are already using." In the past, many companies created budget templates that Intuit customers could use in Google Docs. The tighter links between the two companies will likely encourage the creation of even more templates. Partnering with Google is another way to ensure that Intuit doesn't fall behind the technological curve. Back in 2013, it integrated its platform with Square's point of sale systems to automatically feed transaction data to its books. In late October, it introduced similar integrations with Apple Pay, PayPal, and automated payments company Bill.com. It also agreed to sell its older Quicken, Demandforce, and QuickBase businesses to focus more heavily on small businesses, cloud software, and tax preparation. A win-win deal for both companies Google and Intuit's partnership clearly helps both companies, but it probably won't help Google close the gap with Microsoft on its own, or ensure that Intuit stays ahead of its smaller rivals. But it's still a win-win deal which supports Google's renewed focus on the enterprise software market, as well as Intuit's ongoing efforts to evolve into a cloud-based company.

The group launched a spear phishing attack that targeted vulnerabilities in both the Windows operating system and Adobe Flash, according to Terry Myerson, executive vice president of Microsoft's Windows and Devices Group. The attack, first identified by Google's Threat Analysis Group, involved two zero-day vulnerabilities in Flash and the down level Windows kernel, he explained. It used the Flash exploit to gain control over browsers, elevate privileges to escape the browser sandbox and install a backdoor to gain access to a user's computer. Microsoft is working with Google and Adobe on a patch and plans to release the fix by Nov. 8, when the next update is scheduled, Myerson said. Those who use Microsoft Edge on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update are known to be protected from versions of the attack observed in the wild. Microsoft recommended that users upgrade to Windows 10 and said that those who enable Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection will be able to detect the attempted attacks. Google's Disclosure Google should not have disclosed the vulnerability before the patches were made available, according to Myerson. "We believe responsible technology industry participation puts the customer first, and requires coordinated vulnerability disclosure," he said. "Google's decision to disclose these vulnerabilities before patches are broadly available and tested is disappointing and puts customers at increased risk." Google on Monday revealed the Microsoft and Adobe vulnerabilities, noting that Adobe already had updated Flash to address the flaw. The Adobe patch is available through the Adobe updater and Chrome auto update. Google, per its policy of seven-day disclosure of actively exploited critical vulnerabilities, reported the remaining critical vulnerability in Windows, noting that it was being exploited in the wild. The vulnerability was a local privilege escalation that could be used as a security sandbox escape, noted Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google's Threat Analysis Group in an online post. They urged users to make sure that Flash was auto updated, or to manually update if necessary. They should make sure to apply Windows patches, when available, Mehta and Leonard also wrote. Election Jitters The new attacks came at a sensitive time in the United States, with the presidential election less than a week away. Federal and local officials have made a major effort to ensure the public has confidence in the electoral system. Thus far, 48 states and 36 county and local governments have taken up an offer by the Department of Homeland Security to assist local governments with ensuring that the state and local election systems are protected against cyberattacks, DHS spokesperson Scott McConnell told TechNewsWorld. The states of Illinois and Arizona were targeted more than a month ago by a suspected Russian hack that impacted 200,000 voters in the Illinois voter registration database. There is little risk of a foreign hacker impacting the actual outcome of the race, but there are fears that a new round of cyberattacks could impact the level of confidence in the integrity of the system. "While the actual fallout is hard to predict, it's important to look at the chaos that Russian hackers have allegedly been sowing in the past couple months," said Bryan Burns, vice president of threat research at Proofpoint. "This group has access to multiple zero-day vulnerabilities, which are always very powerful, as no patches exist," he told TechNewsWorld. "The potential fallout, especially with the election just a week away, is quite concerning." David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

They’re both supposed to be smart assistants, and part of that is answering your questions, no matter how dumb they are. In some cases, Alexa relies on skills that you have to enable, and those are only as good as the third-party creators make them. I tried asking Alexa for a Barefoot Contessa recipe, but even with the Food Network skill enabled, she was stumped. For many of its answers, the Google Home pulls from Google’s knowledge graph. Sometimes that makes for helpful answers, but other times, the answers are not quite right or out of date. Related: Is there an Echo in here? How Google Home compares to Amazon’s Bluetooth speaker Here’s what happened when we asked the Amazon Dot and the Google Home a number of the same questions. Both are pretty good at giving the news. What’s the news? Alexa: “Here’s your flash briefing…” followed by NPR news, which I selected as one of my preferences. Home: “Here’s the latest news…” followed by an NPR news summary brought to me by a Chipotle ad. And they can each answer straightforward questions: When is Pi Day? Alexa: Pi Day will be on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. Home: Pi Day is on Tuesday, March 14, 2017. It’s easy enough to ask either Alexa or Google Home for the weather, but I wanted to try something a little more colloquial: Do I need a coat? Alexa: “I added coat to your shopping list.” Home: “Today in Portland, expect a high of 64 degrees and a low of 46 degrees.” Similarly, instead of asking specifically about the World Series during Game 7, I went for a less direct approach: “How are the Cubs doing?”   Alexa: “I don’t know how to answer your question. Home: “The Cubs are up six to three…” I honestly needed to know the answer to this question and decided to put Alexa and the Home to the test: What’s a substitute for coriander? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “According to Rachael Ray, if you are preparing a dish with dried coriander, cumin is a great substitution, as it provides a similar warm, spicy flavor.” Home also pointed out that cilantro, “which people either love or hate,” are the leaves of the coriander plants. Neither is all that great at giving recipes, though: What should I make for dinner tonight? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Let’s look for dinner options. What kind of food are you looking for?” I said, “Something healthy,” and the Home gave me a list of nearby restaurants. What’s a good chicken recipe? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Next, I decided to get political: Who should I vote for? Alexa: “You should vote for the candidate who best reflects your views and has the best policies.” Home: “How you vote is up to you. I can look up information on the election, if you like.” Me: “OK.” Home: … Me: “What should I know about the election?” Home: “I can’t help with that yet.” Who’s going to win election? Alexa: “I can’t tell you who will win, but I can tell you who’s ahead in the polls. Just ask, who’s ahead in the polls.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Alexa: “According to Real Clear Politics’ average of national polling data between October 22 and November 1, Hillary Clinton is polling at 45.1 percent, Donald Trump at 43.1 percent, Gary Johnson at 4.6 percent, and Jill Stein at 2.1 percent.” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help.” Me: “Who’s ahead in the polls?” Home: “Sorry, I’m not sure how to help, but I’m always learning.” Then I wanted to test their bilingual skills: How do you say “Hello” in Spanish? Alexa: “I can’t pronounce that but I’ve written the translation for you.” Home: “Buenos Dias!” How do you say, “I don’t know” in French? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question.” Home: “Je ne sais pas.” I actually knew the answer to this next question, but I was trying to think of something a five-year-old would ask: What do koalas eat? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t have the answer to that question. Home: “Leaves. According to Australian Koala Foundation, an adult koala eats between 200 to 500 grams of leaves each day. Koalas eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. Occasionally, they will eat the leaves from some other native Australian trees, and they also use certain trees just for resting in.” Note: When I was transcribing the answer, I had to ask the question a couple of times, and Home once gave me the definition for equality instead. Both have some decent entertainment skills: Tell me a joke Alexa: “Why wasn’t the turkey hungry on Thanksgiving? Because he’s already stuffed.” Home: “What do you get when you put a vest on an alligator? An investigator.” Neither gave me exactly what I wanted when it came to this music request, though: Play “Dreaming” by Smashing Pumpkins Alexa: Played a 30-second preview, since I didn’t have it saved to my music library. Home: Started playing Siamese Dream I saw the casting news yesterday but couldn’t remember it: Who’s going to be in the Wrinkle in Time movie? Alexa: “Hm, I can’t find an answer to the question I heard.” Home: “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet.” Note: I was thinking of Rowan Blanchard, but apparently Zach Galifianakis has been cast as well. I figured this was a pretty straightforward question but both struggled: How many Grammys has Beyoncé won? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to that question.” Home: “Beyoncé won the Grammy Award for Best R&B song.” Note: That’s just one of Beyoncé’s 20 Grammys. The Home’s answer to this made me think of this Simpsons moment: How many kids does Brad Pitt have? Alexa: “Sorry, I don’t know the answer.” Home: “Six. His children include Shiloh Nouvel Jolie-Pitt, Maddox Chivan Jolie-Pitt, and others.” The Jolie-Pitt kids in turn made me think of Mindy Kaling. Google Home has the ability to answer follow-ups without you having to repeat who or what you’re talking about, so I wanted to test that out. I still had to say “Mindy Kaling” for every follow-up with Alexa, though: How old is Mindy Kaling? Alexa: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling married?” Alexa: “Sorry, I can’t find the answer to the question I heard.” Me: “Is Mindy Kaling’s show still on?” Alexa: “Hm, I couldn’t find any movies called Mindy Kaling.’” Home: “Mindy Kaling is 37 years old.” Me: “Is she married?” Home: “According to E!, Mindy Kaling and BJ Novak’s relationship remains complicated. The 35-year-old actress…” Me: Is her show still on? Home: “Here’s some information for, ‘Is Ellen’s show still on…’” Finally, I wanted to see how much they knew about each other: How much does the Amazon Dot cost? Alexa: “The new Amazon Dot costs $49.99.” Home: “According to Business Insider, Amazon Prime membership costs $99 per year…” How much does Google Home cost? Alexa: “Hm, I’m not sure what you meant by that question.” Home: “Google Home costs $129.

Google has now responded to two of the antitrust charges, but unfortunately, it is still mum about the Android development charge. The company has until November 11th to respond. As for the two charges it did respond to in today’s blog post, the search giant says it’s not using the popularity of its search engine in order to promote its price comparison service, Google Shopping. Tieing into that is the promotion of Google’s ad delivery service, AdSense. The company’s SVP and general counsel Kent Walker made the post, saying that Google’s improvements to its services cannot be considered anti-competitive when the definition of online shopping services has been drawn too narrow by the EU Commission looking into this. The Commission’s original SO drew such a narrow definition around online shopping services that it even excluded services like Amazon. It claimed that when we offered improved shopping ads to our users and advertisers, we were “favouring” our own services — and that this was bad for a handful of price comparison aggregators who claimed to have lost clicks from Google. But it failed to take into account the competitive significance of companies like Amazon and the broader dynamics of online shopping. Walker says because of that narrow definition, the EU fails to see that Amazon is by far the biggest reason online retailers are losing business and that the improvements that Google makes to services like Google Shopping and AdSense help drive traffic to other places, rather than favoring one particular retailer just because it’s the largest. We then showed that our improved ads were helpful to users and merchants. We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t “favouring” — that’s listening to our customers. Google’s response to the Android claims will be interesting to see, but if the company is found guilty of all three of these antitrust complaints, it could face up to $3.5 billion in fines. However, according to a leaked document discovered in the Android antitrust objections, the penalty could order Google to stop offering discounts and payments for pre-installing apps on devices. local_offer    EU   Google   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (17) stars Further Reading Google Play Music gets smart redesign Project ARA Q&A The Verizon Pixel XL is delayed again The Play Store sees another update Verizon launches BOGO deal stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design closeExclusive: Project ARA specifications, design and photos Today’s exclusive Google Project ARA post reveals the phone’s spec sheet and 40 images which show off the phone’s unique modular design. 3 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

By Mary-Ann Russon November 4, 2016 17:45 GMT Chinese researchers have found a critical security flaw in the OAuth 2.0 protocol that enables attackers to hijack user accounts in a large number of Android appsiStock You know that nifty tool that lets you log into new websites and services using your Facebook or Twitter profile? Chinese researchers have discovered a new attack that enables hackers to steal your information and hijack your accounts on a huge number of different Android apps, which have collectively been downloaded over one billion times. Cybersecurity researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) have found security flaws in the OAuth2.0 single sign-on protocol, which was designed to enable users to quickly sign into third-party services and apps using their social media accounts, rather than having to create a username and password. The researchers analysed 600 of the most popular Android apps on Google Play US and Google Play China and found that 182 apps support single sign-on using Facebook, Google and Sina Weibo accounts. Because the OAuth protocol was originally designed for websites, the researchers found that app developers had struggled to apply the protocol correctly in 41% of these apps, including hotel booking apps, holiday planning apps, VoIP call apps, shopping apps, online dating apps, banking apps, news apps, browser apps, video apps and music apps. When you sign into an app – for illustration purposes, let's say the IMDB app – the app asks Facebook to authenticate your identity, and Facebook's server responds with an access token. However, on many of the Android apps, the app developers were not checking whether the information being sent by the social media accounts was correct. And sometimes, the researchers found that the apps would immediately log in an individual even if the user ID information sent through by Facebook, Google or Sina Weibo didn't even match the account details of the user that had an account with the Android app. Man-in-the-Middle attack lets hacker hijack Android app accounts At Black Hat Europe 2016, the researchers demonstrated that if the attacker could discover the email address associated with your Facebook profile, and your name that they could then get out their own mobile device, download the IMDB app and use a man-in-the-middle proxy to replace your profile with their profile. So when the IMDB app asked for the access token, it would look as if Facebook had returned the attacker's profile, instead of yours. And with this, the attacker can then directly control your apps. This might not be a big deal with the IMDB app, but in the case of the hotel booking app, the hacker would be able to pay for room bookings on your credit card, purchase music and videos from the music and video services, and even impersonate you on chat apps. CUHK PhD candidate and lead author of the research Yang Ronghai says that the attack can't only be blamed on app developers – the identification providers Facebook, Google and Sina Weibo are responsible too. "Identity providers don't offer clear developer guidelines for third-party app developers. After we reported this issue to Facebook, Google and Sina, all of them recognised the need to improve the guidelines. Their respective Software Development Kits (SDK) are also confusing for the third-party app developers to use," he told IBTimes UK, adding that Google and Sina have taken action to make OAuth 2.0 guidelines clearer for app developers. "When receiving the identity proof, ie. the access token and user info, the app developers should make a server-to-server verification of the access token and not directly use the user information. In other words, the back-end server should use the access token to retrieve the user data from the back-end server of the identity providers and then use this data to identify the user."

Email Password Remember me Forgot password?     Log in with Facebook Log in with Twitter Log In news tech & science social media business entertainment life sports     Google's latest HTTPS report shows the web is getting more secure Listen | Print By James Walker     Nov 4, 2016 in Technology Google has released its latest HTTPS Transparency Report, indicating how many websites are migrating their servers to use secure connections. Significant progress has been made in the past 18 months, keeping data protected and users safe online. HTTPS encrypts the connection between your computer and the web server. This prevents attackers from intercepting data transfers and extracting sensitive details, such as your username and password for an online service. While there are obvious benefits to using the protocol, much of the web continues to be based on the insecure HTTP. According to Google, considerable progress is now being made as HTTPS becomes more important. The rise of Internet of Things devices and the prevalence of interactions with third-party services necessitates secure connections. General websites are also making the switch, including entertainment and media sites that have begun to turn on HTTPS. Google has added a new section to its Transparency Report that details how HTTPS usage has been increasing over time. 18 months ago, desktop Chrome users on Windows, Mac and Linux were visiting secure sites around 40 percent of the time. Today, two-thirds of page loads on these systems are made over HTTPS. A key reason it's taken so long for HTTPS to see wide adoption is its complexity. In many cases, it's difficult to implement on existing sites and services. Securing an individual website can be complicated, due to HTTPS' certificate process. Most sites will face additional trouble in the form of external connections. Ad networks often don't use HTTPS but are present on many webpages. This can prevent HTTPS working properly across the entire site. Google said it is continuing its work towards migrating to HTTPS "a no-brainer." It noted the positive experiences of retailer Wayfair and technology news site CNET, both of which recently transitioned to HTTPS. Neither site noticed any impact on search rankings or overall traffic. "Security has always been critical to the web, but challenges involved in site migration have inhibited HTTPS adoption for several years," said Google. "In the interest of a safer web for all, at Google we've worked alongside many others across the online ecosystem to better understand and address these challenges, resulting in real change. A web with ubiquitous HTTPS is not the distant future. It's happening now, with secure browsing becoming standard for users of Chrome." The recent rise in HTTPS' adoption has been attributed to a relatively new service called Let's Encrypt. The free certificate authority simplifies HTTPS migrations, making turning on HTTPS as easy as running a set of commands. Its offer hasn’t gone unnoticed by site administrators. In March, it issued its millionth certificate. In September, it gave out the ten millionth. Let's Encrypt is now believed to be the biggest certificate registrar online. It's a non-profit organisation "run for the public's benefit." "We give people the digital certificates they need in order to enable HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for websites, for free, in the most user-friendly way we can," says Let's Encrypt's website. "We do this because we want to create a more secure and privacy-respecting Web."

After recently opening an office in San Francisco, the Canadian wearable tech company became part of the ongoing debate about the relationship between the Canadian and American tech ecosystems. As it turns out, even at a Canadian tech conference, the United States is the elephant in the room. The scent of Silicon Valley sits heavy on every panel and every discussion. This, however, isn’t as discouraging as it might seem. Considering Canada is situated directly above what’s come to be known as the largest innovation ecosystem in history, it’s to be expected. However, Google Canada’s GO North event for Canadian tech professionals demonstrated some tangible faith in Canada’s ability to be a competitive ally in the space. Google Canada took the opportunity through Go North to launch a $5 million prize for nonprofit innovation called the Google.org impact challenge. Google.org, the company’s philanthropic division, will award the money across 10 organizations to help launch their ideas. Five winning organizations will receive $750,000, while an additional five will receive $250,000. The deadline for eligible non profits to submit ideas is November 26th. It seems that for the first time, Google sees Canada as an ally rather than as just a small market. While the Canadian tech landscape has certainly evolved from the tumbleweeds-in-the-desert scene it projected ten years ago, it’s been hard to consolidate that growth when the country’s innovation hubs — Toronto, Kitchener-Waterloo and Vancouver — are so far apart. GO North brought the community together in a way few members of it had seen before. People they’d only ever spoken to on the phone were recognized by their name tags and people who’d supported each other in spades on Twitter were forced to talk to one another other face to face. Panelists featured some of Canada’s most well-known tech titans, including Shopify’s Harley Finkelstein, Dragons Den’s Michelle Romanow, Kik’s Ted Livingston and Mappedin’s Hongwei Liu. Google Canada CEO Sam Sebastian opened the event with a few words of encouragement. “Canada is no longer a place defined by the limits of its geography,” said Sebastian. It’s true that over the past five years the world has finally begun paying attention to their northern watchdogs. Canadians have been in the spotlight as of late, in ways that go beyond our innovation community. “From the perspective of a new Canadian, what we have here is pretty exceptional. The spirit of openness and inclusion shapes not only our national identity but in how we work together,” continued Sebastian. While a spirited, Canada’s innovation community is desperately outnumbered. Some of the event’s key topics included being confident enough to attract American investors, selling to American customers, getting acquired by American companies and familiarizing the United State’s technology hubs. By this point, one begins to sense a theme. “Canada is probably the best place in the world to live if you’re forming a tech company,” said Shopify CFO Harley Finkelstein. He can’t in good conscience however claim that Canada is in a place where it doesn’t need the United States. “Silicon Valley is Mecca. You need to get your butt down there.” While Canada isn’t ready to stand on its own just yet, it’s definitively clear that the population’s collective attitude towards the United States is changing. The first wave of big-time Canadian entrepreneurs, who were once intimidated by the thought of breaking into the United States, have discovered an eager cohort of newly minted founders with whom to share their experiences. The Michelle Romanows and Tobias Lüktes of the country have made tech entrepreneurship a less lonely endeavor. Romanow, who’s founded several notable companies, including Snap Saves, which was acquired by Groupon in 2014, claims that she wishes she targeted the United States sooner, and encourages today’s founders to do just that. “It’s not that the U.S. is ten times bigger, it’s that the U.S. sets the technology agenda for the rest of the world. If you’re a technology platform and you win the U.S., the rest of the world will come in after,” she argues. While discussions during the conference barely wavered from Silicon Valley, rather than focusing on its inarguable importance, the event’s panelists steered the conversation towards weaning Canada off its influence. Several Canadian companies have acted on the desire to give Canada a leg to stand on, whether that means maintaining a Canadian head office or developing a uniquely Canadian voice. Thalmic Labs’ Scott Greenberg, who presented at GO North, explains that though the company has just opened an office in San Francisco, it’s home will always be in Waterloo, Ontario. Thalmic Labs is the developer of the Myo armband. “We are very proudly Canadian. We are very much proud to be here. However, San Francisco, New York and the startup centres are extremely influential and they have a lot of experienced people there,” he states. Thalmic Labs is one of the Canada’s most notable wearable technology successes. While it has offices in both Waterloo and San Francisco, the company has strategically decided to maintain its headquarters in Waterloo. It bears some resemblance to a company which most people have forgotten has a Canadian connection — Pebble. Founded in Waterloo, the company keeps just a small engineering office in Canada, and has gone on to become an international success. The question that remains is, have we entered a phase in the country’s development where a company with a Canadian head office will be considered equal to American-based companies by investors who get just a glimpse of a company’s culture? Finkelstein thinks so. In fact, this is one of his goals for Canada’s tech sector going forward. “As a Canadian entrepreneur that runs a Canadian company, I want to see more head offices here instead of satellite offices,” said Finkelstein. Furthermore, in the quickening decline of Canada’s resources economy, the Canadian government is taking definitive steps to ensure that the country has a future in technology. Navdeep Bains, the Federal Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, believes in Canada’s innovative future. In addition to playing a critical role in the development of Canada’s innovation agenda, Bains has proposed a cluster-based approach to maintaining the hubs, such as those in Toronto and Vancouver, that have developed naturally. “The digital economy is now the economy itself,” he proclaimed in a speech given during Go North. “Virtually every sector of the economy is propelled by digital technologies.” While it sounds rehearsed from the mouths of experts such as Bains, Finkelstein and Romanow, who’ve sat on dozens of panels and time and time again pushed entrepreneurship to eager crowds, the audience seemed behind them every step of the way. It seems that, for the first time, the market is reacting to the ambitions of Canadians rather than the other way around. Maggie Fox, a senior vice president with SAP and a member of the recently launched DMZ advisory council, takes the microphone during the question period to voice this view. The only thing holding Canadians back, she believes, is their perspective of themselves as house cats. “Being Canadian is actually the perfect nationality. I think we just need to get out of our own way,” she proclaims. By the end of the day, at least one thing was made clear. Canada is ready to be more than the United States’ little brother. Zee US is “the largest innovation ecosystem in history” ??? Russ I’m not aware of Pebble having been founded in Vancouver, but perhaps that’s where the company was incorporated. Eric Migicovsky formed his early smartwatch ideas while he was a student at the University of Waterloo, and I had thought he went straight from there to Y Combinator. The “something in the water in Waterloo” quote has been floating around for years, but I’m not sure who originated it. It definitely wasn’t Scott Greenberg, but his use of it underscores how much it resonates in the local tech industry. Ipse This might change next week…. ????

Resend activation e-mail Law & Disorder / Civilization & Discontents Google contests EU antitrust charges on comparison shopping, AdSense Original complainant Foundem counters Google's claims on Amazon, eBay competition. by Kelly Fiveash (UK) - Nov 4, 2016 5:08 pm UTC Login to bookmark 18 Getty Images/Urich Baumgartgen Google has rebutted the European Commission's anti-competitive charges against the ad giant's alleged abuse of dominance in its price comparison, specialised search services, and AdSense businesses. The company—after a number of deadline extensions from Brussels—came out fighting in a blog post penned by Google's chief counsel Kent Walker that was published on Thursday: In recent years, we’ve improved the format of our ads to include more informative displays with pictures, prices, and links where you can buy products. Showing more useful ads benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, you, our users. That’s why we disagree with the European Commission’s argument that our improved Google Shopping results are harming competition. It claimed that EC antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's charge on the company favouring its own price comparison and specialised search—or, as Google prefers to describe it, "shopping services"—over its competitors carried too "narrow" a definition, arguing that it excluded the "competitive significance" of Amazon and other players in that market. Walker said: Our response demonstrated that online shopping is robustly competitive, with lots of evidence supporting the common-sense conclusion that Google and many other websites are chasing Amazon, by far the largest player on the field. UK price comparison site Foundem—the original complainant in the EC case against Google, which was formally opened in 2010—said it was disappointed with the multinational's response. It said that "Google continues to publicly defend its anti-competitive search manipulation practices by misrepresenting both the charges it faces and the important differences between 'shopping' and 'shopping comparison'." Google—to ram home its argument—added that Brussels' case "just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online." It repeatedly talked about how the ad market is constantly shifting, in comments that appeared to largely ignore the historic nature of some of the EC's charges against Google. "There are hundreds of shopping comparison sites and over the past 10 years, some gained traffic, others lost traffic. Some exited the market, others entered," Walker said. "This kind of dynamic competition is undeniable. Online advertising is evolving rapidly, with companies like Facebook, Pinterest, and many others re-inventing what it means to connect merchants with consumers." He claimed that "a rapidly increasing amount of traffic flowed from our search pages to popular sites like Amazon and eBay as they expanded in Europe." Foundem countered: Unfortunately for Google, its continuing protestations about the flourishing fortunes of Amazon and eBay remain the red herrings they have always been. Google does not (yet) have an eCommerce, auction, or merchant-platform service that competes with Amazon or eBay. Therefore, Google does not (yet) have any incentive to anti-competitively penalise Amazon or eBay in its natural search results, and it does not (yet) have any competing service of its own to anti-competitively favour. Separately in the same blog post, Google also disputed the commission's charge against its AdSense business tactics—though it didn't flesh out the reasons for its beef with Vestager in that particular case. Similarly, Google said that it would respond in the next few days to the commission's charge against its Android operating system. Presumably, this too will publicly rebut the bloc's competition chief. The commission is now mulling over Google's responses before it decides on how it might proceed on the three separate charges levelled against the ad giant. If fines are imposed on Google, it faces penalties of up to five percent of its annual turnover for each charge—potentially billions of euros.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google’s RCS push will never work without Verizon Chris Burns - Nov 4, 2016 1 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit While Google announces they’ve begun working with the first US mobile carrier to release RCS to replace SMS and MMS, Verizon is absent from the scene. RCS is also known as Rich Communication Service, and it’s aimed at turning text messaging into a much more function-full service. At this time quite a few mobile groups have joined the call to make RCS a standard for all – but Verizon isn’t amongst them. AT&T launched RCS back in November of 2015, while T-Mobile introduced RCS into their network back in July of 2016. Today Google announced that they’re working with Sprint to bring RCS to their network. Verizon is not a part of this RCS-is-awesome club, announced earlier this year as a nameless global initiative for RCS. SEE: How to escape iMessage and switch from iPhone to Pixel At the same time, just as the RCS standard seems to be getting off the ground, Google has just launched a pair of smartphones. The Pixel and the Pixel XL are sold by Google online unlocked, able to be used on T-Mobile, AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon. And Verizon, according to their ads, is the only place you can get a Pixel. Verizon is not the only place you can buy a Google Pixel smartphone. Google has the Pixel – their most major smartphone release ever – available online with the ability to work with any network. But it’s clear Verizon still has the upper hand. According to a Q2 2016 study done by Strategy Analytics, Verizon had 142.7 million subscribers. AT&T was close behind with 131.8 million, T-Mobile had 67.4 million, and Sprint was forth with 58.4 million subscribers. This information is released with Fierce Wireless and also suggests that Sprint was the only one of the top four carriers to lose customers quarter-to-quarter in “net adds”. Until Verizon starts to see subscriber losses as a direct result of being the only major carrier without RCS, they won’t fold. They’ll continue to work with their own Verizon Messenger and won’t pay RCS any mind. Until Verizon adopts RCS, the service is just another iMessage – lots of potential without full adoption.

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed There’s no best way to handle disclosure of zero-day vulnerabilities 04 Nov 2016 14 Vulnerability Post navigation Previous: Berners-Lee raises spectre of weaponized open data Next: Monday review – the hot 17 stories of the week by Maria Varmazis 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Earlier this week, the headlines flashed with news that Google had disclosed a vulnerability to Microsoft that allows local privilege escalation in Windows 10. This vulnerability is a zero-day, meaning these vulnerabilities did not have an immediate fix, and by making these vulnerabilities public, theoretically an attacker could take advantage of this information and use the vulnerability to their own advantage. A lesser-discussed note to this story is that Google had disclosed this vulnerability privately to Microsoft a week prior, at the same time it had made a similar private disclosure to Adobe about its own actively exploited vulnerability in Flash (CVE-2016-7855). In response to Google’s disclosure, Adobe made a fix to Flash about five days later, with the security update already available to the public. This is good news for Adobe, as Google has a published disclosure policy for what it defines as actively exploited critical vulnerabilities: it will privately notify the vendor and give them seven days to make a fix, otherwise it goes public with the news. Google’s reasoning? We believe that more urgent action—within seven days—is appropriate for critical vulnerabilities under active exploitation. The reason for this special designation is that each day an actively exploited vulnerability remains undisclosed to the public and unpatched, more computers will be compromised. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Google certainly had reason for concern, as Microsoft later identified that the Russian APT group Fancy Bear was already actively using Google’s disclosed zero-day in their own attacks before Google’s disclosure even happened. Microsoft hasn’t yet issued a fix for the Windows vulnerability, but in a blog post response they say one will be available on the next Patch Tuesday, November 8. So what’s a normal vulnerability disclosure policy? There’s no agreement in the security industry for a standard vulnerability disclosure. Many abide by what they call “responsible disclosure,” which means privately reaching out to the vendor with the details of a discovered vulnerability, with the intent to give them time to fix it, and only making the details of the vulnerability public once the issue has already been patched. Often whoever discovered the vulnerability works with the affected vendor to fix the problem. As long as the vendor is making a good-faith effort, the timeline for fixing a vulnerability can be weeks or even months, although many set a deadline to get things fixed before they go public. Google recommends 60 days, though others will give more time. Not everyone in the security industry agrees with the principles of responsible disclosure. Though it may strike some as reckless, some believe that the best course of action is to go public as soon as possible, especially if the vulnerability is being actively exploited. While Google gave both Adobe and Microsoft seven days for a fix, others might have gone public straight away, without giving them a chance to fix it. The idea behind immediately disclosing an actively exploited vulnerability is that the public pressure to fix the vulnerability could make all the difference in the vendor taking it seriously, especially if they have been unresponsive or uncooperative in past disclosure efforts. This approach can sometimes backfire, however, as it makes a potential new avenue for attack public. However, it can also backfire on the vendor if they don’t respond quickly. Do you think immediately disclosing vulnerabilities is too reckless, or the right thing to do? Or was Google right?

Reply Nobody_Holme says: November 4, 2016 at 5:31 pm I fully support Google’s stance. Vendor gets time to patch, but pressure of public shame if it fails. I suspect in reality, competing businesses would do well to give a little leway instead of being seen to snipe at each other, but equally, they’re going to snipe anyway, so doing it when justified is not a big deal. Reply Corey Hitchens says: November 4, 2016 at 6:07 pm 7 day advance notice is more than fair for companies with a full development team supporting thousands of consumers. Smaller businesses with less resources should be given 30 days. Many companies won’t even bother fixing something until its public. A lot of times, the product is vulnerable because best practice coding was not made in the first place. Reply Sean Briggs says: November 4, 2016 at 6:42 pm I think 7 days is is reasonable. The public should know so they can ensure that systems that are vulnerable can be monitored more closely. Reply Jim says: November 4, 2016 at 7:06 pm Seven days seems like enough for an in-the-wild zero-day. But, there are probably exceptions, especially in the area of operating systems. Operating systems are so complex that it can be a daunting task to fix ANY bug in a week. So, yeah, it’s not written in stone. Maybe it should be (like via a standards body, with input from larger companies and security firms)? Reply clifford cuellar says: November 4, 2016 at 9:41 pm I think Google has the right response. Work with the vendor for a week, then go public if that has failed and let public opinion go ti work. My reasoning is that a zero-day is quite possibly already known and used by the bad guys, and failure to fix just gives them more time. At least a warning tells users to be extra vigilant about unusual activity. Reply Tim Boddington says: November 5, 2016 at 6:15 pm I agree with the earlier comments. However, maybe there should be an announcement at the outset that there is a security weakness in a product, but not what it is. Reply Alan Robertson says: November 6, 2016 at 10:35 am I’m not a Microsoft fan (I’m a Linux user), however, in my opinion this was reckless of Google. What did this achieve? All this did was take a bad situation and make it worse by advertising the fact that there was an active exploit, which in turn only encourages more people to abuse it. Google knows full well that Microsoft has adhered to patch Tuesday for quite some time and the timing of this exploit being released to the public seems to be more political than a genuine care for the community. This is the second time that they have done this and the second time they have done so half way between patch Tuesdays – I do not consider this to be coincidental. When did they precisely find out about the vulnerability? Did Google sit on this vulnerability and choose to release it mid way between patch Tuesday cycles or did they release it straight away? If they chose to release this half way between patch Tuesdays then their intention was to damage Microsoft’s reputation and not to report a critical bug. Additionally, how many other “attention diverting” Windows exploits are they sitting on? More transparency please Google – start with log files and a detailed account as to WHEN the zero day team became aware of this. It’s a shame when your zero day task force starts to become more aligned to damaging a competitor than actually genuinely helping to improve security, especially as Microsoft has botched more updates in the last two years than they have in the last twenty. Wouldn’t it make more sense to get the patch correct first time round? An unplanned, rushed out patch could potentially harm more PC’s than the active exploit could – BSOD / endless boot cycles etc. As for Google, they have a bit of a cheek! Android is rarely updated: “More than half of Androids have unpatched security holes” Sophos, 17 SEP 2012 “Android “Master Key” vulnerability – more malware exploits code verification bypass” Sophos 09 AUG 2013 “Shocking” Android browser bug could be a “privacy disaster” Sophos 16 Sep 2014 “87% of Android devices are exposed to at least one critical vulnerability” Sophos, 15 OCT 2015 “900 million Androids vulnerable to Quadrooter bugs” Sophos, 09 AUG 2016 Seriously Google? Why can’t your own zero day team to fix your own operating system first? How about starting with actually having the ability to patch rather than dumping the responsibility on the device manufacturer? You don’t see Microsoft saying it’s the responsibility of Dell / HP / Lenovo etc. to patch Windows? So why does Google get away with this? Reply John says: November 6, 2016 at 11:52 pm In the case of an actively exploited zero-day, public disclosure after 7 days also gives end users the ability to implement alternate solutions to either detect or block exploits using technologies such as IPS and end-point behavioural analytics (whichever is applicable in the specific case). So even if there is no patch, customers can still find other ways to protect themselves. Reply mr x says: November 7, 2016 at 9:28 am wonder how many have opted for 30 day delay on updates to be installed, as that can leave some systems open for long time unless MS has option to force updates that are deemed as currently been exploited (windows 10 you can delay updates upto 30 days when they have come out, and feature upgrades for a year) Reply David Pottage says: November 7, 2016 at 11:02 am There is a second reason for a quick public disclosure, an that is so that users and sys-admins can do their own mitigation while waiting for a proper fix to become available. For example, if it became known that there is an unfixed zero day with MS Powerpoint files, I might update the configuration of my email server or UTM to block such files from external sources, or to add a very stern warning when allowing them through. Of course such a block would be annoying for my users, so I would hope Microsoft would be working very hard on a fix, but if such a bug where being actively exploited, and dozens of emails with booby trapped attachments where arriving every day, I would want something to reduce the risk while I waited for a more complete fix. Reply Alan Robertson says: November 7, 2016 at 4:12 pm Hello David, Unfortunately this is a kernel bug – your UTM isn’t going to stop that. As always it appears as though Flash was used as a means of a delivery system for this exploit – I can only assume that they were spear phishing with a hacked website and hoping the victim would fall for it. Reply Paul Ducklin says: November 7, 2016 at 4:41 pm What I think David is suggesting is not any sort of “Sophos ad,” but merely a way of illustrating how detailed information about an exploit can help you to add mitigations of your own to reduce your exposure, even if your temporary defence [a] only deals with a specific instance of an attack and [b] causes side-effects that you don’t want to suffer for ever. Reply Jim says: November 7, 2016 at 1:53 pm Google should never have revealed this information publically. They should technically be liable if there is a ramp in attacks or exploitations after the release of such information. I’m not pro Microsoft or anti-google at all, but this is just careless and actually ends up aiding and abetting exploitation of these things Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

But did you know that the tool did not work for about 6-months prior to that? So since around April 2016, if you tried to demote a sitelink using that tool - it may have not worked. John Mueller of Google said this in this mornings webmaster hangout on YouTube at the 5:17 mark into the video. He said "the effect of this tool has been dialed down to almost nothing in the last half year or so." He added that "if you have been using this tool to kind of maintain your sitelinks, then probably we haven’t been taking the input from your submissions there into account and we have been using our algorithms anyway." Here is the video embed: Here is the transcript: I guess as a bit of background with the whole sitelinks tool that we had there. This is something that we had been experimenting with over the last couple of years and essentially the sitelinks use normal rankings. So there is nothing special around the sitelinks there. And also the effect of this tool has been dialed down to almost nothing in the last half year or so. So that is something where, if you have been using this tool to kind of maintain your sitelinks, then probably we haven’t been taking the input from your submissions there into account and we have been using our algorithms anyway. So nothing really changed there, outside of us not providing a tool that doesn’t change anything in the search results. Forum discussion at Google+.

By Bob Violino | November 4, 2016 -- 16:16 GMT (09:16 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Self-driving car By 2020, smart machines -- technologies that learn on their own, adapt their behavior based on experience, and are able to come up with unanticipated results -- will be a top five investment priority for more than 30 percent of CIOs, according to new findings from research firm Gartner. special feature AI, Automation, and Tech Jobs There are some things that machines are simply better at doing than humans, but humans still have plenty going for them. Here's a look at how the two are going to work in concert to deliver a more powerful future for IT, and the human race. Read More With these machines moving toward fully autonomous operation for the first time, balancing the need to exercise control over the systems versus the drive to realize business benefits is crucial, the firm says. Presenting the research findings at a Gartner symposium in Australia, research vice president Brian Prentice said Google's self-driving car project is a prime example of why pursuing full autonomy might be neither possible nor desirable in smart machines. "Human beings are still required as the final point of redundancy in an autonomous vehicle, so a fully autonomous car requires a steering wheel should a driver be required to take control," Prentice said. "But putting a steering wheel in an autonomous car means a fully licensed, sober driver must always be in the car and prepared to take control if necessary." Not only does this destroy many of the stated benefits of autonomous vehicles, but it changes the role of the driver from actively controlling the car to passively monitoring it for potential failure." The "Google Steering Wheel Dilemma" is representative of a challenge all smart machine projects must face, according to Gartner. "Smart machines respond to their environment," Prentice said. "But what is the environment that the smart machine is responding to? Environments that are largely uncontrollable are not amenable to smart machine projects because it is difficult, if not impossible, to model accurately." The challenge for organizations looking into this technology is to figure out what is actually controllable, and limit smart machines to those activities that can be accurately modeled and managed. Major unresolved problems in machine learning technologies, such as how to make sure learning data is fully representative and the avoidance of "reward hacking," need to be addressed before any autonomous machine that learns from its environment can be deployed as a mass-market solution, Prentice noted. "The vision of the fully autonomous vehicle will not become reality, for any car manufacturer, in a time frame that doesn't fall into the realm of science fiction," Prentice said. "The failure of this vision will be set against the backdrop of advances in smaller, more pragmatic applications of machine learning in automobiles that will improve safety and driver experience." CIOs who are looking to maximize the benefits of smart machine technology adoption should plan to deliver smart machine-enabled services that help and are overseen by human workers, rather than those that are fully autonomous, Gartner said. They also need to identify and analyze, at the beginning of any project aiming to make use of smart machine technologies, the constraints that smart machine adoption will eventually face.

自由電子報 | 影音娛樂 | 好康報報 | 自由部落 ‧Business Home Front Page Taiwan News Business Editorials Sports World News Features Bilingual Pages Home / Business Sat, Nov 05, 2016 - Page 10　News List Print Mail Facebook Twitter plurk funp Google rejects antitrust allegations made by EU AFP, BRUSSELS EU Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager uses a smartphone to take a photograph from the podium at the Delegation of the EU to the US, before a news conference in Washington on Sept. 19. Photo: EPA US-based Internet company Google on Thursday rejected new EU accusations that it illegally abuses its market dominance, in its formal reaction to antitrust allegations by Brussels earlier this year. Google filed objections against charges made by European Commissioner for Competition Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, said in a blog that the shopping case “still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online.” “We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law and economics,” Walker said. The EU now has three cases against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager. The biggest and most recent case involves Google’s Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company’s most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs. Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week. The second and oldest case involves Google’s alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged last year, and then in July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding. Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party Web sites. The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably. Instead, the cases have raised tensions between Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks Corp, Amazon.com Inc and McDonald’s Corp. This story has been viewed 1079 times. Comments will be moderated.

Google fires back on EU antitrust case, and says it’s only playing catch-up with Amazon Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders November 04, 2016 The start of the affair. (Reuters/Francois Lenoir) Share Written by Joon Ian Wong Obsession Borders November 04, 2016 The European Commission’s grasp of the e-commerce world is so weak, it doesn’t even “fit with the reality” of how people actually shop online. And by the way, Amazon is where consumers go to compare prices, not Google. That’s the message Google sent to the commission yesterday in a blog post by general counsel Kent Walker. The commission is charging Google for anti-competitive behavior around three of its products, including its shopping comparison feature. Fines could run into the billions. Google’s post was published as the firm submitted formal responses to two of the commission’s charges. It said it would soon respond to the commission’s charges around Android, its smartphone operating system, which is seen as potentially the most serious of the outstanding cases. Google’s missive was laced with condescension. The company schooled the commission on what it claims are the realities of online shopping. “We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” Walker wrote. Here’s Google’s argument: Consumers aren’t going to Google, or other search engines, to find the best price for a product; they’re going straight to merchants to do so. Dedicated shopping apps, some of which belong to merchants, are the most popular way for people to shop on their smartphones, Google claims. Amazon is “by far the largest player in the field” when it comes to online shopping, with Google “chasing” it. Amazon is where customers go first to check for prices—it’s twice as popular as Google for this function in Germany, according to one piece of research cited by Google. If anyone’s going to dominate price-shopping, it’s Amazon, not Google. Customers go to Amazon to price-shop, and to actually make purchases, making it an “even stronger competitor,” Google says. When Amazon enters a new European market, traffic drops to sites that only provide price-comparison, Google claims. The commission’s suggested fix is for Google to highlight price-comparison sites in its search results. But Google says its data shows that its users don’t want to use those sites, and that the commission’s solution would be tantamount to subsidies for these sites. Opposition to Google’s arguments sprung up immediately. FairSearch, a group that campaigns against Google and whose members include Nokia, Oracle, Expedia, and others, said: “When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money.” Google appears to be digging its heels in for what looks set to be a protracted fight over its future in Europe.

According to the NFL, the series will deliver an immersive experience for users. That’s kind of the point of VR, really, but the series will ostensibly allow users to experience what it’s like to train with the Philadelphia Eagles defensive line in the build up to the big match day. Additional episodes will look at the culture of American Football in other parts of the country, like Green Bay, or specifically the internal organisational workings of the San Diego Chargers. We can already see the most viewed episode being the one the NFL describes as letting viewers “tag along with the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders” … “This series will give fans an opportunity to connect with the NFL like never before, whether they are on YouTube or using Google’s virtual reality headset, Daydream View,” said Amit Singh, Vice President, Google VR.  “We’re thrilled to work with the NFL to capture the series with Jump and bring it to YouTube and Daydream.” NFL’s adoption of VR on such a serious scale is a big win for the technology as a whole, despite its exclusivity to Google Daydream. In the past, questions have been asked about the feasibility of the technology and its success largely depends on the adoption of VR as a viable commercial medium from a majority of markets. That is exactly what’s happening with the NFL’s adoption, and it isn’t a purely esoteric play only appealing to the USA. American Football has a rapidly growing appeal outside of North America, with London’s Wembley Stadium playing host to a number of competitive NFL fixtures every season, with every game a sell-out. Google has snared a bit of a win with that in mind.

Sony releases Android Nougat beta update to Xperia X Performance It is also interesting that the global smartphone OS shipments and market share in Q3 2016 grew 10.3 percent over the year, whereas iOS and other operating systems lost a sizable share. Apple's exclusive iOS for its iPhones, iPads and iPod Touch devices captured 12.1 percent, leaving a negligible share of 0.3 percent to other operating systems for mobile devices. "Android's domination of global smartphone shipments remained strong in Q3 2016, with a record 88 percent of all smartphones now running Google's OS," Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement. "Android's gain came at the expense of every major rival platform. Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 percent share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa." But that dominance comes with its own challenges. According to Woody Oh, director of Strategy Analytics, "Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google's new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place." The report also added that the global smartphone shipments grew 6 percent year-over-year to 375.4 million during the quarter, which is the fastest growth rate for a year. Samsung took the lead in the global smartphone shipments with 75.3 million units, which dropped from 83.8 million a year ago. Huawei, Oppo and Vivo recorded major growth in the smartphone shipments, contributing 9 percent, 5.8 percent and 4.9 percent to the total smartphone market share during the quarter.

Along with BT and Mozy, the companies have publicly pledged to join the government’s Competition and Markets Authority’s (CMA) clampdown to prevent users getting caught out by sudden price hikes or service terminations. In a statement announcing the move, the CMA said all four companies had committed to addressing several areas of concern in their terms of use. As such, they’ve promised to give users “adequate notice” ahead of any significant changes being made to prices or contracts, and greater transparency around how to terminate their deals with the firms. The CMA has previously warned cloud firms that indulging in such behaviour could put them at risk of enforcement action for violating the Consumer Rights Act 2015. LiveDrive, JustCloud and Dixons Carphone were first to commit to the CMA’s campaign back in May 2016, but the likes of Dropbox, Google and Microsoft were noticeable by their absence. With Google and Dropbox now joining the fold, Computer Weekly contacted Microsoft – whose OneDrive cloud storage services is used by hundreds of millions of users worldwide – to see if they have any plans to follow suit. At the time of writing, the company has not responded.   The CMA said the organisation is, however, working with a number of other organisations who are yet to publicly commit to making changes to their terms of use and ensure their behaviour does not fall foul of consumer rights laws. Read more about terms and conditions of cloud use Remote device management firm LogMeIn comes under fire from IT support and managed service providers, who claim its subscription renewal system has hit them with hundreds of pounds of “unexpected” credit card charges. LiveDrive, JustCloud and Dixons Carphone commit to fairer usage terms for cloud customers, but Microsoft and Google are conspicuous by their absence. Nisha Arora, senior director for consumer enforcement at the CMA, said the commitments should go some way to ensuring consumers know they can entrust their data to the cloud with confidence. “People increasingly rely on cloud storage as a safe and convenient place to keep family photos, music and important documents, so it is vital that they are treated fairly and are not hit by unexpected changes to price or storage levels,” said Arora. “We are pleased that these four companies have followed the three others which agreed commitments earlier this year to improve their terms and conditions, providing a better service for their customers.” CW+ Features Enjoy the benefits of CW+ membership, learn more and join.

For many, it seemed improbable that more than 50% of the country would vote to leave the European Union. Of course, the Google data ended up being eerily accurate. When will the US election results be announced? Everything you need to know Now, with the US election appearing a tighter race than previously expected, Google Trends data is once again being carefully studied. And the results are perhaps a little surprising. Given all the controversies around Donald Trump, one might be forgiven for expecting that search data for the Republican nominee would be greater than for the Clinton campaign. Yet in the last week this has not been the case. Searches for Hillary Clinton have soared since October 28, consistently ranking around 10% ahead of Trump The top trending questions include: ‘Where was Hillary Clinton born?’, ‘Will Hillary be indicted’, ‘How much is Hillary Clinton’s net worth’, ‘Where is Hillary?’ and ‘How old is Hillary’. Top searches were for the Clinton Foundation and emails If you look at search data in some of the swing states, searches for Hillary Clinton are also ahead In Nevada: Clinton has 47% of the searches while Trump has 42%, in Arizona: Clinton has 50% to Trump’s 39%, in Colorado: Clinton has 45% to Trump’s 40%, in Iowa: Clinton has 49% to Trump’s 39%, in Ohio: Clinton has 47% to Trump’s 41%, Florida: Clinton has 48% to Trump’s 43%, North Carolina: Clinton has 47% to Trump’s 42%, Virginia: Clinton has 45% to Trump’s 39%, Pennsylvania: Clinton has 48% to Trump’s 42%, and New Hampshire: Clinton has 45% to Trump’s 43%. Clinton searches are also leading 49% to Trump’s 39% in typically Republican states such as Texas. And it doesn’t stop there. Most of the USA is watching Clinton over Trump too – with far more watching the former first lady on YouTube Once of the most watched videos has been this ‘Women will be the reason’ video by the Clinton campaign But searches for ‘Vote Trump’ are ahead of ‘Vote Clinton’ What does this mean? Trump certainly has been louder during the US election campaign, but it looks like Hillary Clinton’s message is clearly getting through. The pundits have both candidates pretty much neck and neck in the polls, but this data could indicate that rather than there being a legion of shy Trump voters – as has previously been predicted – what we could end up seeing is a surge in shy Clinton voters – i.e. those who will not publicly say they are voting for Hillary Clinton but will do so in the ballot box. While this data doesn’t give any clue to the demographics of people searching, those shy Clinton voters could be the million of American women and other minority groups. What do you think?

Technically, Hayden reassigned Pallante to a new job in the Library of Congress, but Pallante rejected that offer and resigned. While we -- and some others -- pointed out that this was a good opportunity to reshape the Copyright Office away from being a taxpayer-funded lobbying organization for Hollywood, some folks who support ever more draconian copyright immediately jumped on all sorts of conspiracy theories about how this was really Google somehow firing Pallante, including one site that directly had that as a headline. To anyone who actually had knowledge of what was going on, this made no sense. Hayden is not connected to Google in any way. This is just out and out tinfoil hat conspiracy theory territory from people who see "Google" behind any policy they dislike. It seemed rather obvious that, like just about any new CEO of an organization, Hayden was clearing out some senior staff for a variety of reasons. And there was a pretty obvious big reason why Hayden would like to reassign Pallante: she has been directly and publicly advocating for Congress to move the Copyright Office outside of the Library of Congress. If you came in to run an organization and one of your direct reports was going over your head to try to transfer an entire division somewhere else, it's likely you'd fire that person too. It's kind of a management 101 thing. Over the past week, in talking to a few people at the Library of Congress, or close to it, this is the basic story that came out. Hayden didn't feel comfortable with Pallante publicly advocating against the Library of Congress, and used her role as the boss to remove her from that position. Others seem to be discovering the same thing. A report at Publisher's Weekly notes that the conspiracy theories are bunk: But multiple observers familiar with both the Copyright office and the library’s operations told PW that Pallante’s ouster was not necessarily rooted in any specific disagreements over copyright policy. Rather, it most likely was a matter of Hayden “getting the Library’s house in order.” Pallante, the sources noted, has strongly urged lawmakers to remove the Copyright Office from under the purview of the Library of Congress and make it an independent agency, with the register becoming a Senate-confirmable presidential appointee. “If Congress wants to remove the Copyright Office, it can do so,” explained one source, who did not want to be identified. “But, for now, it is part of the Library of Congress.” The source added that Hayden couldn’t be expected to lead the Copyright Office forward with a subordinate pushing Congress for the agency's independence at the same time. At press time, LoC officials had not yet commented Another close observer, who also did not want to be identified, agreed and said there was no shadowy Silicon Valley plot to remove Pallante and “jam in” a more tech industry-friendly Register, as some reports have suggested. From what I can tell, the "tech" industry was just as surprised about this as anyone else. Even the Authors Guild, which initially rang the alarm bells is now slowly, calming down and realizing that it may have overreacted. In an update, it notes that Hayden doesn't appear to have been taking orders from the tech industry. She also told them that she believes that the Library of Congress shouldn't be taking a major role in policy making: When we asked Dr. Hayden whether she intended to respect the traditional role of the Copyright Office setting policy without interference from the Library, she very clearly stated that she does not intend to weigh in on copyright law or policy. She said that policy and legislative efforts are the domain of Congress, not the Library. Her job, she explained, requires her to ensure that the Copyright Office has the technology and resources for the proper operations of the registration and recordation systems. She was sympathetic with our desire to see the Copyright Office receive the funding necessary to create a robust registration and recordation system that meets 21st-century needs. Of course, what's not entirely clear from that statement is if it means that the Copyright Office should also go back to its more traditional role of focusing on registering copyrights and similarly not weighing in on copyright law or policy. If she says that's not the role for the Library of Congess, then doesn't that also apply to the Copyright Office since it is a part of the Library? Either way, I know it's popular for some people to assume any conspiracy theory around "Google" must be true (and, just you watch, someone in the comments here will now try to rope this post and me into that conspiracy), but this one comes up empty once you actually look at the details. It won't stop the conspiracy theorists, but they can spin their wheels with their tinfoil hats, whiteboards and theories about sea creatures.

One way to get there is to follow the leaders. In networking these days, big cloud companies like Google and Facebook are at the top of their game. They run giant data centers, continually launch and modify large-scale applications, and don’t seem to be bound to big system vendors. Many ordinary enterprises would love what the internet heavyweights have: standardized networks that can support any application without administrators having to configure a lot of proprietary hardware. Conveniently, some of those cutting-edge companies offer parts of their technology to others through open-source specifications. But there are limits to how well a company in the insurance or machine-tool business can emulate world-changing tech giants. It turns out no one can just become Google, at least not overnight. Here are five things that most enterprises can’t actually do to become like the Internet giants, followed by five things they can. 1. Have special equipment built just for their networks Companies like Google and Facebook design their own gear and hire manufacturers in Asia to build it. They need so many switches, servers and other devices that this custom gear is made in high volume and competes on cost with ordinary products. Only a handful of enterprises are big enough to do that. Have you ever spooled out 950 miles of cable for one data center, like Facebook does? 2. Attract the best and most adventurous network engineers – a lot of them Practically every IT shop can make an argument for why a bright young engineer should come work for them, but no bank or farm-equipment company is quite Amazon or Microsoft. Being where some of the hottest technologies are born is a big draw for talent, and this pays dividends. An army of top engineers comes in handy when you want to build a cutting-edge network. “There’s a tremendous battle for talent right now,” says IDC analyst Brad Casemore. 3. Only acquire companies with similar cultures and approaches to technology At the big internet companies, acquisitions are usually tech startups. The fit may not always be perfect, but their cultures tend to be similar and their technology modern. The employees who come with these companies often are used to working on new technologies and ready to quickly change direction. Some become the network engineers who help make web giants hum. By contrast, mainstream enterprises often buy companies that come with legacy systems and IT staff who have a hard time getting used to new technologies, says Nick Lippis, co-chairman of the Open Networking User Group (ONUG). 4. Standardize and automate all IT systems Companies like Google keep their maintenance overhead low with a top-down approach to IT, migrating all applications to the same computing and networking platforms. “They standardize ruthlessly ... and then then automate dogmatically,” said Gartner analyst Joe Skorupa. Their vast technical teams, plus that focus on buying young companies, help make this possible. By contrast, some ordinary enterprises have thousands of applications to deal with and require 100 people to sign off on a project before it can happen, Lippis says. It’s much harder to use the same technical approach across the board in such companies, so it could take years to gain the full efficiencies that come from SDN (software-defined networking) and policy-based networking. 5. Base everything on open hardware and software Efforts like the Open Compute Project’s networking initiative have created a fledgling ecosystem for finished products that are open. But even though you no longer have to design and code everything yourself just to escape the proprietary world, it’s still more than average IT departments can do, some analysts say. “Most enterprises would struggle with this,” IDC’s Casemore said. Though the movement has produced some hardware and software products that are designed for mixing and matching, this is still a work in progress. “I don’t think they’ve put together the right packages, to this point,” Casemore said. The good news Though the stars aren’t aligned for network automation in enterprises as much as they are at the webscale giants, it’s not as if average companies are powerless. There are steps they can take to get some of the benefits of the next generation of networking, analysts say. 1. Start small Implement new technologies on the sidelines, where engineers can learn and the benefits can be proven. “Carve off new projects, and that’s where you introduce the innovation,” Gartner’s Skorupa says. For example, if you set up a new Hadoop cluster, try buying Hewlett Packard Enterprise switches with software from SDN startup Cumulus Networks just for that implementation. If it works in one place, it may later become a candidate for enterprisewide deployment. 2. Broaden your horizons If you’re dependent on one network vendor, diversify. Big network vendors say they want to partner with their customers, but that attitude actually shortchanges enterprises, Skorupa says. By keeping blinders on, they miss opportunities to save money and buy products that might be better for them. “When they define themselves in terms of their vendor, that’s something a hyperscale guy would never do,” he said. Cloud companies define themselves by the services they deliver and then find the best vendors to support those. Though juggling two vendors is harder in networking than in computing, it’s worth it for the leverage, Skorupa said. 3. Explore new approaches that go part of the way While going completely agile, white-box and software-defined may be beyond an average company’s abilities, there are technologies that offer some of the benefits without all the headaches. For example, Arista Networks sells switches with some white-box benefits, like standard hardware and lower cost, but with service and support included so enterprises aren’t on their own. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s Altoline switch family is approved by OCP and can be ordered with OSes from Cumulus or Pica8. An open installation environment allows for other OSes, too. 4. Try some easier automation tools There are also software products that can bring automation to networks from brand-name vendors. These systems take policies based on an enterprise's intent and automatically translate them into code or CLI commands for network devices from multiple vendors. This can be a way around having to hire all those ace developers being lured away by webscale companies, ONUG co-chairman Lippis said. For example, the Apstra Operating System, from the Silicon Valley startup Apstra, can work with equipment from Cisco, HPE, Juniper Networks, OCP and others. It includes telemetry to detect and report on whether the network is really carrying out the intended policies. 5. Get the CEO on your side. Standardizing and automating a network is easier with fewer applications, and all these efforts require hard choices that some people won’t be happy with. Be prepared for them to fight change all the way up the chain of command, Skorupa says. To keep individual departments from blocking network evolution, you need an ally at the top.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google is rolling out RCS, the successor to SMS, on the Sprint network Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsNovember 4, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google has quietly shut down the Google Showtimes website and brought some of its features over to Google Search. It's not known exactly why the company shut down Showtimes, but it's likely it wasn't making much money from the service.More In a mobile world full of capable messaging apps such as Allo, Snapchat, Line, WeChat, and others, plain old text messaging seems a bit antiquated by comparison. Due to the technological constraints imposed by simple messaging service (SMS), the cellular standard which powers basic text messaging, cellular messaging lacks support for the sort of animations, videos, and stickers which most clients boast. But that’s about to change. On Friday, Google announced that it will begin rolling out an advanced texting standard called rich client messaging, or RCS, to Android phones on the Sprint network. RCS is best described as text messaging on steroids — basically, it’s a modernized version of SMS that brings the aging standard up to par with clients like iMessage and Facebook Messenger. It supports features like group chats, read receipts (timestamps that indicate when a message has been received and seen), high-resolution photo sharing, and typing indicators (the animations that indicate when chat participants are pecking out sentences). It can transmit images and videos up to 100 times larger than multimedia text messaging, the outgoing standard that currently performs that legwork. And it features robust support for group messaging, including the ability to name groups, add new members, and leave existing groups. Related: Google Messenger 2.0 brings unread message badges — on certain Android devices The upgrade will begin in earnest later this year. Sprint subscribers with Android devices running KitKat 4.4 will see RCS become available in the coming weeks, provided they’ve installed Google’s Messaging application from Android’s Play Store app market and selected it as their default messaging app. Select LG and Nexus phones, meanwhile, will be “automatically upgraded” to RCS through a forthcoming app update. And owners of Google’s Pixel devices, which ship with Messenger preloaded, will have access to RCS as long as they don’t switch their default messaging app to another client. Eligible users will be notified via popup message when RCS becomes available. From within Messenger, they’ll be able to toggle a few of the standard’s features including read receipts, typing indicators, and whether or not data’s used for messaging. Taking advantage of RCS won’t be nearly as complicated in the future. Beginning next year, all Android devices sold by Sprint will come with Messenger configured as the default texting app. Related: T-Mobile breaks the limitations of regular, boring text messaging with advanced messaging  The launch is the fruit of Google’s Jibe Mobile purchase. The company’s technology, which Google acquired late last year, forms the framework of Google’s Universal RCS platform, a standardized text messaging platform the company announced at Mobile World Congress in February. In a speech to attendees, a Google representative promised a “consistent” and “inter-operable” version of the RCS spec that would work with non-Android devices and integrate with third-party APIs and open source tools. Indeed, Google’s RCS ambitious extend far beyond the Sprint network. The company intends to bring the spec to other carriers in the coming months, though it declines to say which. But its hands are tied. RCS, unlike the messaging technologies behind internet-based clients like Facebook Messenger, requires support at the cellphone carrier level, and the uptake has been slow: only 49 carriers worldwide have adopted RCS since its debut in 2007. (A notable holdout in the U.S. is Verizon, the nation’s largest cellular provider.) Worse yet, fragmentation is beginning to emerge: many of those carriers are on an older version of RCS that’s only partial compatibility with the flavor that Sprint and others plan to implement. Related: Google aims to beef up text messages with open source system And then there’s the elephant in the room: Google’s own internet-based messaging platforms, all of which eschew support for RCS in favor of older or proprietary alternatives. Google’s new Allo client, which comes pre-installed on Pixel phones, lacks robust support for cellular messaging. And Hangouts, the company’s all-in-one messaging client, has yet to implement RCS. But all the same, the search giant appears committed, at least in part, to moving toward the promised future of RCS: platform-agnostic advanced text messaging. “[Text messaging] is one of the most ubiquitous forms of communication today, used by billions of people worldwide,” Amir Sarhangi, head of Google’s RCS efforts, wrote in a blog post. “We’re excited to see this first launch of RCS come to life, providing a better carrier messaging experience for millions of people in the U.S.” Messaging Showdown: WhatsApp vs. iMessage vs. Facebook Messenger vs. Allo Hands-on: Google Allo Allo and Duo news: what we know about Google’s all-new communication apps Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

By Conner Forrest | November 4, 2016, 7:39 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/iSergey More than half of the web pages loaded in the Chrome browser are accessed through HTTPS, according to statistics release by Google in a blog post on Thursday. Additionally, about two-thirds of the total time spent browsing by Chrome users now occurs on HTTPS-connected sites, and Google expects these numbers to continue to grow. For those unfamiliar, HTTPS is the secure version of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for communication over a network. HTTPS is known for its ability to help defend against man-in-the-middle cybersecurity attacks, and provide certain types of encryption for web traffic. Google also announced Thursday that it was adding a section for HTTPS data in its Transparency Report. In terms of the percentage of pages loaded over HTTPS in the Chrome browser, Chrome OS users had the highest amount, followed by Mac users, Linux users, Windows users, and Android users, in that order. SEE: 5 best practices for switching your site to HTTPS for improved security However, this order changed when the report considered the percentage of browsing time spent on HTTPS websites in Chrome. For that metric, Linux users took the top spot by a large margin, followed by Chrome OS, Mac, and Windows, with Android users well at the bottom of the list. "A web with ubiquitous HTTPS is not the distant future," the post said. "It's happening now, with secure browsing becoming standard for users of Chrome." Image: Google The blog post by Google claims that HTTPS offers the best performance on the web and supports features like "credit card autofill and the HTML5 geolocation API that are too powerful to be used over non-secure HTTP." For companies that want to move their site to HTTPS, Google posted two FAQs to help them better understand the process.

If you're a webmaster, try using these five best practices as you make the switch. Google has also been increasing security in other areas, too. In August, the company added HSTS encryption to Google.com, and it added new phishing warnings to Gmail around the same time. In mid-October, Mozilla Firefox celebrated a record number of HTTPS connections as well. Apple also recently said that it would require HTTPS in all iOS apps by 2017. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google recently released numbers showing that more than half of the pages accessed in its Chrome browser were connected securely through HTTPS. Google also announced that it would begin labeling HTTP connections as non-secure, and provided a couple FAQs for businesses to make the switch.

For example, the Apstra Operating System, from the Silicon Valley startup Apstra, can work with equipment from Cisco, HPE, Juniper Networks, OCP and others. It includes telemetry to detect and report on whether the network is really carrying out the intended policies. 5. Get the CEO on your side Standardizing and automating a network is easier with fewer applications, and all these efforts require hard choices that some people won’t be happy with. Be prepared for them to fight change all the way up the chain of command, Skorupa said. To keep individual departments from blocking network evolution, you need an ally at the top.

No, this isn't a reboot of the iconic British movie released in 1987 about the sexual relations between three people, Rita, Sue and Bob. It's about Google DeepMind's latest artificial intelligence creation, Alice, Eve - and Bob too - and their secret conversations. Yes, that's right, Internet giant Google's artificial intelligence division DeepMind has created a version of AI with its very own algorithm which protects messages shared between robots Alice, Eve… and Bob.

Alice had to send a secure message to Bob. Bob then had to decipher the message, while Eve had the job to, as her namesake suggests, eavesdrop and decrypt the messages between Bob and Alice. The bots didn't have much of a head's up either. They weren't pre-programed with information on how to encrypt stuff, they were set to function failure and left to their own devices. The networks, Alice, Bob and Eve, subsequently created a generative adversarial network (GAN) between them. GAN basically means unsupervised machine learning, which is when it all gets a bit complex. Basically, Alice and Bob were eventually able to create encryption tricks that mean they could hide messages from Eve. This, according to a recent article in Big Think, is "a little worrisome." "Alice and Bob are the first neural nets who've kept secrets from their programmers. That we know of," the article says. On one hand, Alice, Bob and Eve are a remarkable development in the world of AI — on the other — the whole concept offers the possibility of a future in which robots will be able to keep secrets from their creators — humans — which could be used for more sinister purposes. ...

SUBSCRIBE Walter Cronkite Google doodle marks 100th birthday of America’s favorite journalist Cronkite became known as 'the most trusted man in America' during his career, reporting on the events that shaped our world. Amy Gesenhues on November 4, 2016 at 8:35 am More Google used its home page today to celebrate what would have been Walter Cronkite’s 100th birthday. During a career that stretched nearly five decades — from his start as a radio announcer in Oklahoma to his last day as CBS Evening News anchorman in 1981 — the journalist became known as “the most trusted man in America.” The doodle leads to a search for “Walter Cronkite journalist” and includes a sharing icon to post the image on social profiles or send via email. The animated doodle rotates through a series of significant dates during Cronkite’s career at CBS Evening News, including: April 16, 1962 — Takes over as anchorman on CBS Evening News. November 22, 1963 — Announces death of President John F. Kennedy. July 20, 1969 — Reports Apollo 11’s successful lunar landing putting the first man on the moon. March 6, 1981 — Cronkite’s last day as CBS Evening News anchorman, giving up his chair to Dan Rather. “Walter Cronkite, the legendary broadcast journalist reported, served, and comforted a nation during its most trying times, including World War II, Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the assassination of JFK, to name a few,” writes Google on the Google Doodle Blog. In celebrating the iconic journalist, Google included the following quote from Conkrite’s autobiography, “A Reporter’s Life” published in 1996: Press freedom is essential to our democracy, but the press must not abuse this license. We must be careful with our power. The free press, after all, is the central nervous system of a democratic society. That’s an idea that is as relevant and important today, if not more so, than when it was originally penned 20 years ago.

It’s more powerful than SMS — without that silly 160 character limit and with better support for images and video and group chat. But like SMS, it’s a carrier-based solution, which means that it has to prove that it can overcome historical problems that SMS has had, including crazy pricing models and weird interoperability problems from carrier to carrier. Google has been working on getting carriers on board since at least February of this year to prove that very thing, and today it finally has something to announce: Sprint is switching over to RCS on its Android devices. Everything that ships next year will support it, and “select LG and Nexus phones” will get software updates. Sprint jumps on default Android RCS first Sprint uses Google’s solution for supporting RCS, called Jibe, but it should be able to send and receive messages with any phone because it comports with the “Universal Profile” for messaging put out by the GSMA. That profile should mean that any RCS-compatible phone should be able to send multimedia messages to any other RCS-compatible phone (and fall back to SMS if that fails). But “should” and “will” are two different things, and even though it’s 2016 we still don’t fully know how all this stuff will really shake out just yet. AT&T supports RCS on a pretty big array of Samsung and LG phones — using their custom-built Messenger apps — but we don’t know if its solutions will work with Android’s default Messenger app yet. T-Mobile announced support for RCS back in July 2015. On Sprint, RCS will work — blessedly — through the standard Android Messenger app. That’s one of three messaging apps that Google ships on phones (the other two are Allo and Hangouts), and that lack of messaging clarity is a sore point for Android users. The two most important people in my life are both fighting with me over which of these apps to use. So I named the folder what it is pic.twitter.com/Loup3NJGWM— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) October 30, 2016 I’m well aware that outside the United States, different regions have different messaging apps that have reached a critical mass of users and become the go-to default. But that still doesn’t really absolve Google of the responsibility of having its own opinion on how messaging should work for Android. Right now the strategy is “try everything” with a side of “don’t piss off the carriers by supplanting a potential revenue stream with your own messaging solution” (that’s not an exact quote, of course). That means that Google has three apps it installs by default on the Pixel, for example: Allo for consumers, Hangouts for enterprise, and Messenger for carriers. Only one of those target markets should matter — and let’s just say that Allo isn’t really competitive yet. But hey, maybe I’m wrong and RCS will take over the planet next year and solve all our problems. We’re certainly overdue for a powerful replacement for SMS that works across all carriers and phones. Google says that it looks “forward to launching RCS with more partners in the coming months.” This post was updated to reflect that T-Mobile announced support for RCS in July 2015.

One way to get there is to follow the leaders. In networking these days, big cloud companies like Google and Facebook are at the top of their game. They run giant data centers, continually launch and modify large-scale applications, and don’t seem to be bound to big system vendors. Many ordinary enterprises would love what the internet heavyweights have: standardized networks that can support any application without administrators having to configure a lot of proprietary hardware. Conveniently, some of those cutting-edge companies offer parts of their technology to others through open-source specifications. But there are limits to how well a company in the insurance or machine-tool business can emulate world-changing tech giants. It turns out no one can just become Google, at least not overnight. Here are five things that most enterprises can’t actually do to become like the Internet giants, followed by five things they can. 1. Have special equipment built just for their networks Companies like Google and Facebook design their own gear and hire manufacturers in Asia to build it. They need so many switches, servers and other devices that this custom gear is made in high volume and competes on cost with ordinary products. Only a handful of enterprises are big enough to do that. Have you ever spooled out 950 miles of cable for one data center, like Facebook does? 2. Attract the best and most adventurous network engineers – a lot of them Practically every IT shop can make an argument for why a bright young engineer should come work for them, but no bank or farm-equipment company is quite Amazon or Microsoft. Being where some of the hottest technologies are born is a big draw for talent, and this pays dividends. An army of top engineers comes in handy when you want to build a cutting-edge network. “There’s a tremendous battle for talent right now,” says IDC analyst Brad Casemore. 3. Only acquire companies with similar cultures and approaches to technology At the big internet companies, acquisitions are usually tech startups. The fit may not always be perfect, but their cultures tend to be similar and their technology modern. The employees who come with these companies often are used to working on new technologies and ready to quickly change direction. Some become the network engineers who help make web giants hum. By contrast, mainstream enterprises often buy companies that come with legacy systems and IT staff who have a hard time getting used to new technologies, says Nick Lippis, co-chairman of the Open Networking User Group (ONUG). 4. Standardize and automate all IT systems Companies like Google keep their maintenance overhead low with a top-down approach to IT, migrating all applications to the same computing and networking platforms. “They standardize ruthlessly ... and then then automate dogmatically,” said Gartner analyst Joe Skorupa. Their vast technical teams, plus that focus on buying young companies, help make this possible. By contrast, some ordinary enterprises have thousands of applications to deal with and require 100 people to sign off on a project before it can happen, Lippis says. It’s much harder to use the same technical approach across the board in such companies, so it could take years to gain the full efficiencies that come from SDN (software-defined networking) and policy-based networking. 5. Base everything on open hardware and software Efforts like the Open Compute Project’s networking initiative have created a fledgling ecosystem for finished products that are open. But even though you no longer have to design and code everything yourself just to escape the proprietary world, it’s still more than average IT departments can do, some analysts say. “Most enterprises would struggle with this,” IDC’s Casemore said. Though the movement has produced some hardware and software products that are designed for mixing and matching, this is still a work in progress. “I don’t think they’ve put together the right packages, to this point,” Casemore said. The good news Though the stars aren’t aligned for network automation in enterprises as much as they are at the webscale giants, it’s not as if average companies are powerless. There are steps they can take to get some of the benefits of the next generation of networking, analysts say. 1. Start small Implement new technologies on the sidelines, where engineers can learn and the benefits can be proven. “Carve off new projects, and that’s where you introduce the innovation,” Gartner’s Skorupa says. For example, if you set up a new Hadoop cluster, try buying Hewlett Packard Enterprise switches with software from SDN startup Cumulus Networks just for that implementation. If it works in one place, it may later become a candidate for enterprisewide deployment. 2. Broaden your horizons If you’re dependent on one network vendor, diversify. Big network vendors say they want to partner with their customers, but that attitude actually shortchanges enterprises, Skorupa says. By keeping blinders on, they miss opportunities to save money and buy products that might be better for them. “When they define themselves in terms of their vendor, that’s something a hyperscale guy would never do,” he said. Cloud companies define themselves by the services they deliver and then find the best vendors to support those. Though juggling two vendors is harder in networking than in computing, it’s worth it for the leverage, Skorupa said. 3. Explore new approaches that go part of the way While going completely agile, white-box and software-defined may be beyond an average company’s abilities, there are technologies that offer some of the benefits without all the headaches. For example, Arista Networks sells switches with some white-box benefits, like standard hardware and lower cost, but with service and support included so enterprises aren’t on their own. Hewlett-Packard Enterprise’s Altoline switch family is approved by OCP and can be ordered with OSes from Cumulus or Pica8. An open installation environment allows for other OSes, too. 4. Try some easier automation tools There are also software products that can bring automation to networks from brand-name vendors. These systems take policies based on an enterprise's intent and automatically translate them into code or CLI commands for network devices from multiple vendors. This can be a way around having to hire all those ace developers being lured away by webscale companies, ONUG co-chairman Lippis said. For example, the Apstra Operating System, from the Silicon Valley startup Apstra, can work with equipment from Cisco, HPE, Juniper Networks, OCP and others. It includes telemetry to detect and report on whether the network is really carrying out the intended policies. 5. Get the CEO on your side. Standardizing and automating a network is easier with fewer applications, and all these efforts require hard choices that some people won’t be happy with. Be prepared for them to fight change all the way up the chain of command, Skorupa says. To keep individual departments from blocking network evolution, you need an ally at the top.

Published: 04.11.2016 Pulse News Agency International By AFP Print eMail play The EU commission accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services (AFP) US vote uncertainty keeps pressure on Asia markets NNPC Corporation loses N11.22bn in 1 month Forex Crisis Stakeholders proffer solutions at CBN dialogue Buhari AfDB approves $600m loan for Nigeria Facebook Tech company skids on growth worries after blowout quarter HSBC French prosecutor says British bank should stand trial in tax fraud case In Egypt Central bank floats pound Tweet US Internet giant Google on Thursday rejected new EU accusations that it illegally abuses its market dominance, in its formal reaction to anti-trust allegations by Brussels earlier this year. Google filed objections against beefed up charges made by hard-charging European Commission competition chief Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, said in a blog that the shopping case "still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online." "We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics," Walker said. The EU now has three cases on the go against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager in a campaign that has raised hackles on the other side of the Atlantic. The biggest and most recent case involves Google's Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company's most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs. Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week. The second and oldest case involves Google's alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged in 2015, and then this July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding. Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party websites. That case concerns Google's AdSense service where websites can install a customised search engine on their site which generates revenue from having relevant ads appear on the search results page. - 'Interests of consumers' - The European Commission, confirming it had received the response to the shopping and Adsense cases, said it "will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation." The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably. Instead, the cases have raised tensions between the Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald's. The European Commission, which polices EU competition policy, launched an initial investigation into Google in 2010 following complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and Trip Advisor that it favoured its own services when customers ran searches. "We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers," said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case. Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. Since that time, attitudes in Europe towards Google have deteriorated after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Silicon Valley giants had provided troves of personal data to US intelligence.

It marks a moment in time that we will look back to. The moment when Google, after years of hinting, even dabbling, finally decided to build its own smartphone. The Pixel, though it is being physically constructed by HTC (in the same way that Foxconn operates for Apple), is the first smartphone designed entirely by the minds in Mountain View. It is an enormously important device for that reason, which means that Google needed to make sure it was excellent. Early reviews indicate that it is not only excellent, but one of the best phones ever made. We still have a lot of work to do to make any determination of that level, but the early reaction from us is much the same as anywhere else. The Pixel is phenomenal. Hardware Though it has not had much experience in the hardware department, every device Google has designed itself, like the Chromebook Pixel and Pixel C, has been excellent from a fit and finish perspective. The Pixel is no different. Design-wise, as many others have noted, there is no denying the Pixel holds many similarities with the iPhone. You can’t really blame Google for going with a safe design on its first attempt, one that the company must have known would appeal to the widest range of buyers, but I would have liked to see Mountain View offer something with a little more flavor than this. The phone is primarily aluminum and glass, which means it not only shares DNA with the iPhone, but just about every smartphone currently on the market. Google attempted to differentiate its device by adding a glass shade to the back. While it’s supposedly there to help users orient the device in their hand, in my short time with the phone, it feels like nothing more than a ploy to make the design less stale, which it fails to do. I never thought of the Nexus 6P as a rickety device, but you can feel the upgrade in craftsmanship with the Pixel. It is very well constructed, while remaining light and thin enough to not be overwhelming given its large, 5.5-inch screen. The device does have an interesting wedge shape to eliminate the camera bump on the back which I initially feared would make it feel top-heavy or disproportionate, but it’s not even noticeable unless you’re specifically looking for it. Just about everything from a hardware perspective befits the phones hefty price tag (our 32GB Pixel XL in Very Silver retails for $769 unlocked), including the screen, which has impressed me as much as any other device I’ve used in 2016. There are some downsides, however. When leaks of the device first surfaced, many voices across the internet blasted the phone’s large bezels. I will not deny the Pixel has large top and bottom bezels, but my eye adjusted to them pretty quickly and even after just a few minutes the wasteful bottom chin rarely caught my eye. That said, it is absurdly large, and even more confusing. Why Google couldn’t find some way to utilize that space, or get rid of it altogether, is beyond me. More disheartening, though, is the serious speaker downgrade. Last year’s 6P came with dual front facing speakers, some of the best on a smartphone ever. The Pixel killed the dual speaker dream. Google’s first smartphone comes with a pitiful single speaker that offers halfway decent sound, but doesn’t get terribly loud and can sound muddy at high volumes. I’ll save more in-depth thoughts about the hardware for the full review, but my initial impressions are strong. I’m impressed with what Google was able to do in its first time out, and HTC should be given a pat on the back for doing a phenomenal job with construction. Software Twelve hours is not nearly enough time to make pointed criticism of the Pixel’s software, but my first reactions to it are, like with the hardware, largely positive. Much of the aesthetic changes Google made, such as the new Pixel launcher, circle icons and new folder design, aren’t my favorite but they also aren’t so offensive as to really enrage. They’re fine. I still prefer the Nexus look of Android, but I’ll have to see if the new ideas grow on me. The big addition, of course, is the Google Assistant. Again, I haven’t spent nearly enough time with it to make any definitive statement, but so far it seems smarter than Google Now and Google Now on Tap, but still not smart enough. It is conversational, as advertised, meaning you can ask it something like “Who is the President?” and then “How old is he?” and the Assistant will know you want to find out the age of Barack Obama. Despite the obvious improvement over Now on Tap, the Assistant can still be hit or miss. For instance, yesterday I asked what time the Oklahoma City vs. Golden State basketball game was, to which it correctly answered 10:30 p.m. EST. But, when I asked what channel the game was on as a follow-up, the Assistant was clearly lost and instead directed me toward popular articles involving the word “game.” Still, it seems like the Assistant could provide some real utility and I’ll have to see if that pans out over my time with the device. As a final thought, let’s talk about how fast this phone is. A lot of talk was made about the Pixel benefitting from Google becoming vertically integrated, controlling both the hardware and software side of production, meaning the company could optimize the latest version of Android for the Pixel better than any Nexus in the past. So far, that seems to be true. The smartphone has healthy specs, including a Snapdragon 821 and 4GB of RAM, to back it up, but it is without a doubt one of the most responsive and quickest devices I’ve ever used. I haven’t put it through intensive use yet, but it is noticeably quicker than the Note 7, for example, and perhaps slightly faster than the LG G5, Moto Z and HTC 10, though I’m relying mostly on distant memory for those comparisons. Of course, the issue with most Android smartphones is not how fast they are to start, out of the box every flagship phone should perform impeccably, it’s how well they hold up over time that matters. Camera Google was quick to talk a big game about the Pixel’s camera, noting that the phone received the highest ever score from DxOMark on announcement day. A high benchmark score is one thing, how the camera performs in a real world setting is something completely different. But, early reviews have been glowing, with some critics going as far as saying the Pixel has the best smartphone camera ever. I won’t go that far, not yet. My early experience has been fantastic, however. The photos are sharp, with good color, dynamic range and detail. All the things you’d want from a photo are supplied by the Pixel, but the best part is how fast it is. The app launches and takes photos instantly, even with HDR+ set to on by default. All I want from a smartphone camera, and I’ve said this numerous times in the past, is to give me the confidence that the shot I want will be the shot I get. That means the quality needs to stand up to scrutiny, but the system needs to be fast enough for the photo to be captured in the first place. I don’t take a ton of photos, so generally cameras aren’t high on my priority list and I view a great camera as a luxury. For those that do place camera performance at the top of their checklist, the Pixel has the makings of being a top contender. I can’t stress enough that these are all first impressions based on just a few short hours with the Pixel. That said, first impressions have often told me a lot about how my experience with a device will pan out.

The profile, which is backed by 58 global operators, OEMs and OS providers, upgrades existing operator messaging services, providing users with a common, consistent and globally interoperable service that includes features such as group chat, hi-res photo sharing and read receipts. Sprint's service is available from today via the Messenger app for Android devices developed by Google to subscribers using Android. In 2017, all new Android devices from Sprint will come pre-loaded with Messenger for Android. "We are delighted that Sprint has become the first operator to roll out the Universal Profile to their subscribers and hope that this will encourage other markets across the world to follow their lead," said Alex Sinclair, Chief Technology Officer, GSMA. "A single, open and common universal profile will help to drive the global adoption of RCS services, and make it easier for consumers to enjoy rich, consistent and interoperable messaging experiences regardless of device or network." The Universal Profile reduces cost and time-to-market for OEMs by allowing them to use the same client for both operator customers and open market devices. It will also mean that users have uniform feature sets and a consistent user experience. The profile simplifies the process for operators who want consistency across devices and for OEMs who are expected to keep up with ever-changing standards. The Universal Profile will also be supported by a formal GSMA accreditation process.

We’ve all been there. It was just in your pocket a minute ago — and now it’s gone, lost to the phone fairies, forgotten between the seats of your couch, or misplaced somewhere during your busy day. Maybe it’s just in your other coat, or maybe it’s already in the hands of someone who found it on the sidewalk. Either way, all you want to do is get it back. Related: Motorola’s Connect Coin is set to be a Bluetooth tracker on steroids Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to get a hold of your missing phone. If it’s a smartphone (or even a tablet) running iOS, Android, or even Windows Phone, chances are good it already has the software needed to hunt it down — or there’s an app you can install to find your phone. Here’s our guide on how to find your phone or a similar device, including the old-fashioned way if you still own an aging flip phone. Smartphones If your lost phone happens to be a smartphone, all three of the major smartphone platform providers (Apple, Google, and Microsoft) now include phone retrieval technology in their smartphones, just in case you ever end up losing it but forget to install a “find my phone” app. Usually, the way these apps work is through the account associated with your device. For Android devices this is your Google account, for iPhones this is your iCloud account, and for Windows Phones this is your Microsoft account. All three allow you to remotely lock and wipe your phone, make it ring, and set up special messages to alert whoever finds it. Of course, these features are only as good as your phone’s battery. If your smartphone dies, it’s about as easy to find as your wallet or anything else you might misplace. We also recommend caution when communicating with anyone who has found your smartphone. Be careful to avoid giving away any personal information, such as your home address, until you know you’re dealing with someone you can trust. Stick with sending phone numbers or email addresses to communicate how the good Samaritan can return your phone. Here’s how each of the three operating systems work. Android Android not only offers Google’s own service for finding and managing your device remotely, but also a number of third-party apps designed for finding your smartphone. The easiest to use is Android Device Manager, which is built directly into your Android smartphone through Google Play Services — it can also be used in a browser, or downloaded from the Google Play Store. Most devices running Android 2.3 or later should be able to use this feature. It’s as easy as searching  “Where is my phone” in Google to start looking for your smartphone. We’ve previously written about Device Manager and its ability to call you, set up a new password, make your phone ring, and the variety of other functions it uses to notify someone. While you can configure Android Device Manager ahead of time, the service should be available in the event you lose or misplace your phone. It will use Wi-Fi or GPS to help you hunt down your device. Android Device Manager ScreenshotsMore If you can’t find your smartphone, you can always wipe it to prevent sensitive information from getting into the wrong hands. Your device will need an internet connection, however, and enough juice to communicate with you. Read More There are also third-party apps that you can install to help find your phone. Lookout Plan B and Cerberus Anti-theft are both great apps that can be installed remotely to get even more information regarding the whereabouts of your phone. Both provide a number of additional features, such as more granular control on how you track your device, screenshots of what your device is doing, photos from the camera to possibly catch the would-be thief, and other, more detailed notifications that Android Device Manager doesn’t offer. If your device is rooted, there are even more features available to prevent someone from resetting or turning off your device until you can recover it. Lookout Plan B hasn’t been updated since 2013, however, so it might not work as well on a smartphone running a recent version of Android. If you own a Samsung device — such as the Galaxy S6 — there’s also the reactivation lock feature, which allows you to render a stolen or lost device unusable unless someone enters you Samsung account details. The reactivation lock even rules out factory resets, which Android Device Manager and other services cannot as easily prevent. Another option for certain Samsung smartphones is the Find My Mobile service. It can be used to locate a missing phone, lock it down, or wipe it completely. You’ll need a Samsung account, and the Remote Controls options enabled on your phone. To check and see if Find My Mobile is available for your smartphone, go to Settings > Security. If you see Find My Mobile in the menu, you can use the service; enable the Remote Controls options via Settings > Security > Find My Mobile > Remote controls. samsung-find-my-mobileMore iOS The best (and only) way to get your iPhone back is through Apple’s native feature, Find My iPhone. The app comes pre-installed on every iOS device, and can display your missing device on a map to help you easily locate and manage it. You’ll need a computer or another iOS device with the Find My iPhone app to deploy this feature, however. Sadly, these features are only available when your phone is powered on and connected to the internet. To use the feature, simply log into iCloud and open the Find my iPhone feature. The Apple service will locate your phone on a map and give you the option to play a sound on your device, send a message to your phone with “lost mode,” or erase its contents. All of this can be done without any additional configurations. Find my iPhone is also able to locate your Mac, iPod, and iPad. It’s an incredibly effective tool for tracking down just about any iOS device. Don’t believe us? Check out this story about cops apprehending a criminal by using the app. This is just one among many similar stories where phone-tracking software helped save the day. Apple also utilizes another form of security, known as Activation Lock, to keep your iPhone safe from theft. Like the reactivation lock for Samsung smartphones, Activation Lock requires you to enter your Apple ID and password before you can disable Find My iPhone, wipe your device, or reactivate it. Windows Phone Windows Phone owners, don’t fret. If you’ve misplaced your smartphone, you too can recover it with the help of Microsoft’s built-in service. The company has built a lost phone feature directly into Windows Phone 8.1 and later iteration thereof, allowing you to easily find the location of your phone or activate its ringer remotely. It doesn’t require additional configuration after you add your Microsoft account either, though it will only work if your device has power and is connected to the internet. Find My Phone Windows PhoneMore All you need to do is go to Microsoft’s devices page. There, you should see all your phones and tablets, which you can then locate through the service. You can even add devices that are not currently on the list, remotely lock your devices, and wipe devices you think might have fallen into the wrong hands. How to find your not-so-smart cell phone Step 1: Call your cell phone. Listen for the ring or vibration and try to locate your phone through tried-and-true human detection. If your phone is truly lost and in someone else’s hands, then they’re likely to answer if they intend to return the phone. If you don’t have access to a phone, try using wheresmycellphone.com or freecall.com. Both websites will call your phone for free and allow you to leave a message or talk to whomever is on the other side. Step 2: Retrace your steps. Do a full-fledged visual search. If you couldn’t hear a ring or vibration when you called it, don’t immediately assume that your phone is located far away — the battery could simply be dead. Step 3: Text your phone. If you believe someone has stolen or possibly found your phone, then send a text message to your phone with your contact info and a reward offer if you choose to do so. There are many online services that allow you to send free text messages, such as txt2day.com. Step 4: Alert your service provider. If you’ve lost hope of finding it, then call your wireless carrier and let them know your phone is lost. Ask if they offer a GPS locating service. If not, ask them to suspend service to your phone to avoid any possible fraudulent charges. Carriers have differing policies about this, but it’s always worth a try, even for a smartphone. Step 5: Register your lost phone. If you know your phone’s serial number, or have it written down somewhere, register it with MissingPhones.org. Step 6: Prepare for the next time you lose your phone. Maybe you’re one of those people who’s always losing their phone. You may want to consider registering for a tracking service such as AccuTracking.

Just like Amazon’s Echo, Google Home, released today, has microphones tuned to hear from across the room. Both devices can be asked to cue up music on Spotify and other services, set alarms and timers, and pose factual queries. And both companies say their devices will gain powers as other companies integrate their services, letting you do things like order takeout from your couch. But Google has a crucial advantage in the race to prove out that idea. It’s been working on technology that answers people’s questions for a long time, and has invested more heavily in machine learning than its rivals. Early reviews suggest that advantage is already apparent. People who compared Echo, and its Alexa assistant, with Google Home found the latter to be significantly better at understanding language and answering questions. The New York Times’ reviewer describes Google Home as “preternaturally smarter.” The Verge’s sums it up like this: “Home has something that the Echo doesn’t: a wealth of knowledge about the world, my personal preferences, and my habits.” That doesn’t mean Google is about to prove the thesis that an intelligent speaker can become a universal helper and companion. Like Echo, Google Home performs well at only certain things, like controlling music. It doesn’t plug into many other devices or services yet. And just like Amazon’s product, it is limited by being tied to a single account and unable to recognize individuals, preventing customized responses that draw on a person’s other data. Google’s determination to make its assistant the future of search on mobile, too, and its investments in machine learning give it a better shot at solving those limitations. And Amazon knows it. The company is investing in machine learning research and is even considering unusual ideas such as giving Alexa the ability to recognize emotions. The contest between the two companies—perhaps to be joined by Apple—could produce a much needed jump in the power of virtual assistants. They have become much more polished since Siri was first launched in 2009, but have yet to attain the power and flexibility needed to make them a dominant way to interact with computers.

Google Fiber is, after all, still kind of a nascent business — in most cities where it has a presence, it’s still just a toe-hold, with more expansion waiting on the horizon. So are the other towns and neighborhoods who have been waiting for service still going to get it? Would-be gigabit internet subscribers who have been anxiously nibbling their nails can now breathe a sigh of relief, as Google’s dropping some clarification: yes, yes you will. As DSL Reports has noted, Google executives are soothing local media in cities where the company has already broken ground, reassuring residents that plans to maintain and expand the Fiber footprint are not abandoned. Cities where Google Fiber is already under construction or where the company is already serving customers will indeed keep their service, and plans to expand it to other neighborhoods and suburbs are still on track. So that means metro Atlanta, Austin, Charlotte, Kansas City (both KS and MO), Nashville, Provo, Salt Lake City, and the NC Triangle — Raleigh, Durham, Chapel Hill — are all still good to go. Likewise, planned expansions already in progress in Huntsville, AL; Irvine, CA; Louisville, KY; and San Antonio, TX are going to continue. “We’ve already begun construction here in San Antonio and things are moving forward,” a Google Fiber representative told the San Antonio city council. In fact, city staff in the same meeting said that construction is moving ahead faster than many residents expect, and so they’re trying to come up with a system of warning neighborhoods in advance who’s going to be working on their streets, when. Construction isn’t moving quite so quickly in all of the Fiber cities on the list, however; in some, notably Nashville and Louisville, legal challenges from incumbent providers AT&, Charter, and/or Comcast have slowed down deployment. Before any cable can be laid in those cities, Google first has to help the local governments defend themselves against the suits that seek to stall out competition.

Cars that can move without a human in the driver’s seat have been in development for almost a century, but we are still far from trusting them with our lives in any circumstance The Mercedes-Benz F 015 Luxury in Motion in Shanghai, China in May, 2015. Daimler MATT BUBBERS Special to The Globe and Mail Last updated: Friday, Nov. 04, 2016 2:55PM EDT Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Share on Google Shares Comment s Futurama, the biggest hit at the 1939 World’s Fair, envisioned a future of forests, farms and cities connected by mega-highways that would be populated with radio-controlled cars. Futurama exhibit at the 1939 World’s Fair in New York City. Wikipedia Commons Safety and speed: yours by 1960, promised the exhibit. Its designer, Norman Bel Geddes, would be the first but not the last to make predictions about when self-driving cars might take over daily commutes and reshape cities. Mark Fields, CEO of Ford, said his company would have fully autonomous cars on the road by 2021. BMW’s boss announced the same deadline. A GM executive said it would be 2020 or earlier. Audi CEO Rupert Stadler said 2025. Tesla’s Elon Musk said fully autonomous cars would be possible by 2018, but governmental regulations would hold back its roll out. And now Musk says all 2017 Teslas will have “full self-driving hardware.” Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Nissan, said 2020. Sergey Brin said Google would have autonomous cars available to the public by 2018, but that was in 2012. “They are going to be retracting that,” Krzysztof Czarnecki said of the CEOs’ grand predictions. He is the principal investigator at WatCAR – the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research – at the University of Waterloo. “They are going to say, ‘What we have is what we promised.’ But I believe what people think they are promising today is probably much more than what will be delivered.” When Tesla announced in October its cars “have the hardware needed for full self-driving capability,” the company actually meant its cars will be able to accomplish the feat in certain situations: sunny warm days, certain roads, etc. Autonomy is not binary. “Full autonomy” is more marketing buzz than anything else. Self-driving Cars The most extreme ways car companies are testing self-driving technology 2:01 When will AVs be ready? You won’t be able to walk into a Ford dealership in 2021 and buy a car that drives you home. Fields said those first autonomous vehicles will be for ride-sharing fleets only – likely because they’d be extremely expensive. And when Musk says a self-driving car is possible by 2018, he defines it as a car that’s safer than a human driver – which is by no means safe. And none of the executives are talking about cars that can drive through a Canadian winter, where road markings are obscured and the surface is slippery. The disconnect lies in the definition of autonomy. Despite the faithful and breathless coverage of these announcements, what autonomous vehicles (AVs) actually are often goes unexplained and unexamined. “A lot of people use the name ‘autonomous car’ for completely different things,” said Eberhard Zeeb, a senior manager who works on driver-assistance systems at Mercedes-Benz. “Maybe through the press it was launched that Google or Apple or Elon Musk could build up autonomous cars very easily – I think that’s probably not true.” Today, vehicles with Level 2 autonomy are as good as it gets. These cars with Level 2 autonomy – from Mercedes-Benz, Audi, BMW, Ford, Hyundai, GM and others – can accelerate, brake and steer themselves on highways in good weather, but the driver must constantly monitor the situation, taking over at any time, without warning, when the car makes a mistake, which does happen. Levels of autonomy When it comes to cars there are five levels of automation as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE). Level 0 – No automation: The driver does all the work. Level 1 – Driver assistance: A computer lends a hand occasionally such as with cruise control. Level 2 – Partial automation: The car can help you drive. It can steer, accelerate and decelerate without the driver touching the steering wheel or pedals. Tesla’s ‘autopilot’ system is the best-known example of this. The driver can’t take his hands off the wheel and if there is a problem, the driver must immediately take over. Level 3 – Conditional automation: The car is responsible for driving, monitoring the environment and making decisions. No company has a Level 3 on the market yet, but many say one will be available within five years. A human must be ready to take over if the sensors fail. Level 4 – High automation: The car can drive in all situations by itself, as long as it stays in a safe, well-mapped area. This is the first level where the driver can take a nap. Level 5 – Full automation: The car can go anywhere, any time, in any weather. No steering wheel, no pedals. There is no need for the driver to pay attention because he or she can’t take over control anyway. What auto-industry CEOs are promising with their bold announcements is anything from Level 3 “eyes-off” to Level 4 “mind-off” autonomy by early in the next decade, and they haven’t said how much such luxury might cost. “We’re working hard to have the first Level 3 systems on the road,” Zeeb said. “Maybe in the next-generation [Mercedes] E-Class. Maybe a little earlier.” He said the end of the decade is a reasonable time to expect Level 3 cars. But even this “eyes-off” automation isn’t quite the robo-car of the collective imagination. These vehicles would be limited to driving in certain places in certain weather conditions, and the driver would still have to be ready to take over on short notice. What about Level 5, complete autonomy? “Normally we say it’s not before 2030,” Zeeb said. “But if you really want to go anywhere in any weather conditions, I would say it would be at least 2050 or so for full autonomy.” What’s taking so long? For one thing, autonomous vehicles are illegal in most North American jurisdictions. Cars in which the driver relinquishes control are only allowed with special testing permits and they require a human in the driver’s seat should something go wrong. Uber self-driving Ford Fusion in Pittsburgh Uber Uber’s self-driving taxis in Pittsburgh have an engineer behind the wheel as a back-up and a co-pilot in the passenger seats taking notes. Google’s self-driving Lexus SUVs are limited to 25 or 35 mph and have a driver behind the wheel. As of late 2015, Google’s AVs detected autonomous system failures once every 8,600 kilometres on average. In each case, the car alerted the human driver to take immediate control. But the biggest hurdle is the technology. An AV must first see the world around it, then distinguish and recognize individual objects, predict where they might go, and how it should navigate them. Driving in the chaos of a city – where a child could dart from between parked cars – in snow, fog or rain, and on bad roads with little or no markings is a complex task and presents a huge challenge for a machine. Researchers in Canada are working on AVs that will work not just in sunny Silicon Valley, but in snowy, colder climates as well. The Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research self-driving car sits idle on a test road near the University of Waterloo campus in September, 2016. Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research “The projects we’re trying to push forward that differentiate us from the rest of the self-driving community are those focused on what we have in Canada that is different: surprisingly degraded road surfaces and lane markings,” said Steve Waslander, associate professor and director of the University of Waterloo Autonomous Vehicle (WAVE) laboratory. Researchers at Waterloo are working on several autonomous-related projects including: lane and marking detection, getting AVs to recognize and understand even half-erased markings; creating secure, hacker-resistant systems; improved methods of machine learning to make it more reliable; and teaching AVs to recognize and estimate when the road surface might change – useful for safely navigating a patch of black ice, for example. When we arrived at the University of Waterloo, they’d just taken delivery of a Lincoln rigged with sensors and cameras to use as an autonomous test vehicle. Self-driving cars Canadian universities developing self-driving cars for bad weather 3:00 At McMaster University, Saeid Habibi and his students are developing a system that can track and predict the movement of other vehicles, even if they are momentarily obscured, crossing in front of a truck, for example. What is LIDAR? LIDAR (light imaging, detection and ranging) will be a key component of self-driving cars, according to just about every major company, with the notable exception of Tesla, whose suite of “full self-driving hardware” doesn’t include it. LIDAR can “see” even in bad weather. It looks like a spinning siren, usually mounted on the roof. It works like radar, but instead of emitting radio waves it sends out laser beams which bounce back to create a 3-D image of a car’s surroundings. It creates a real-time map of the car’s surroundings up to 100 metres away and accurate to a couple centimetres. The display screen inside a McMaster University test vehicle showing the image from a Lidar and a camera. Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail Habibi says a LIDAR costs $35,000 and some research cars use four or six of them. That means adding hundreds of thousands of dollars to the price of a car. But there are companies working to bring the price down into the hundreds of dollars. Once that happens, LIDAR will still need to be augmented by radar sensors, cameras and detailed road maps. Still, the cost and size of LIDAR technology has to come down a long way before it’s ready for your average compact autonomous car. There are other issues to solve before AVs will be ready to tackle inclement weather – such as creating ultra-accurate road maps that update in real-time and figuring out how to communicate with and acknowledge human drivers, cyclists and pedestrians. Getting to 100 “We are at the point now where, yes, we can demonstrate that radar can detect most cars, LIDAR can detect most cars, most pedestrians, signs, road markings,” Waslander said. “But we don’t want ‘most of the time.’ We want all the time. … We want to get to the point where we can trust these vehicles with our lives on a daily basis.” Habibi recalled seeing an autonomous vehicle demonstrated in 2006. When he asked why it wasn’t on the market, he was told: “The sensors were more expensive than the car itself, but they could only detect pedestrians with 97-per-cent accuracy.” For every 100 pedestrians in its way, it might hit three. But what if autonomous vehicles are never 100-per-cent safe? At what point do we allow them onto roads, knowing they could injure or kill someone? When it’s safer than a human driver? The trunk on the Waterloo Centre for Automotive Research self-driving car Jordan Chittley/The Globe and Mail “I wouldn’t see it as how much technology we need to add,” said Sebastian Fischmeister, associate professor at WatCAR. “I see it more as the behaviour of drivers, drivers accepting the risk that comes with these vehicles. Because covering 100 per cent of all cases is virtually impossible,” it could take a generation of drivers growing up with autonomous cars to truly accept the risks. So when will the autonomous car of your dreams be ready? It’s complicated. But while you wait, consume the hype with a healthy dose of skepticism.

Government 14/11/16 © Google Google continues price comparison conflict 04/11/16 Google has once again rejected the EU’s objections to how it displays shopping links in its search results. It said the investigation following complaints from price comparison websites had failed to understand the “reality” of online shopping. Europe’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, first accused the firm of abusing its dominance in search engines in April 2015 and made further claims in July 2016. Google’s shopping results appear as a box of images and links displayed alongside other search results. In 2015, Vestager claimed these results gave prominence to Google’s own services and advertisements, to the detriment of price comparison websites, which may have lost visitors. Google responded that the EU had failed to take into account the significance of online shopping giants such as Amazon, which it said also competed against price comparison websites. In its updated claim, the EU said Amazon could not be considered a rival to price comparison websites because it sometimes paid such sites to be included in search results. Google’s latest response says websites such as Amazon get a “tiny fraction” of their visitors from price comparison websites, “hardly enough to support the idea that they don’t compete” with one another. In a blog, google wrote: ‘The commission’s revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online. ‘It’s not surprising that when Amazon and other new competitors arrived in European countries, traffic to sites offering only price comparison went down.’ The company said it would ‘look forward’ to continuing discussions with the commission.

Google is rolling out a new feature intended to help Android developers grow their businesses: subscription promos. Subscriptions have increased consumer spending tenfold in the last three years, Google says. Soon, developers will have the option to create a limited-time introductory price for new subscribers. An app creator with an app that normally charges $5 per month could, for example, offer a subscription for $1 per month for the first three months. "We know how important subscriptions are in helping you monetize and we're continuing to invest in features to support your subscription business," Larissa Fontaine, global head of apps business development for Google Play, wrote in a blog post. Introductory pricing not only helps attract new subscribers, but also allows users to test a program or game before taking the full-price plunge, she said. //Related Articles The 100 Best Android Apps of 2016 Fontaine also touted some recent updates for Android developers, including the Early Access open beta program; pre-registration for Android app downloads ("which has driven more than 30 million installs so far," she said); and the Indie Corner collection, which highlights up-and-coming titles. Google, meanwhile, plans to revamp the Play store, infusing artificial intelligence to allow for better recommendations, according to Reuters. We should also expect the option of more ways to pay for apps, which is currently limited to credit/debit cards, gift cards, PayPal, direct carrier billing, and any Google Wallet balance you have. The types of apps is also set to expand beyond simply mobile offerings. Google's Daydream virtual reality headset, Android Wear 2.0 for smartwatches, and Chromebooks will be receiving an increasing amount of software support in the Play Store.

Share on FacebookShare on Twitter Share on LinkedInShare on RedditShare on Google+E-mailShare on TwitterShare on WhatsApp Google was once a cloud pioneer, having spent years stringing together data centers to support its search business. But it squandered that lead by allowing others to market such infrastructure as a service first. Alphabet, Google’s parent, is now intent on narrowing the gap with Amazon.com and Microsoft, in large part because it needs to build a reliable revenue stream that doesn’t come from ads. Last November, Alphabet asked board member Diane Greene to piece together the fragments of its cloud business. Greene, the co-founder and former chief executive officer of VMware, which develops cloud systems for companies, has unified several departments into a single unit called Google Cloud. In June she hired Tariq Shaukat to lead its growing sales team. Shaukat’s previous job was chief commercial officer for Caesars Entertainment in Las Vegas, making him a bit of an odd duck at a company populated by computer engineers. More than one person in Silicon Valley has described Greene as having a “blank check” for acquisitions. Since she came on board, her unit has shepherded at least four sizable deals, including the $625 million purchase of Apigee, which makes tools for corporate users of cloud-based applications. A year into the job, Greene has something to show for her efforts. Google’s share of the so-called public cloud market—which includes data storage, computing, and networking services—has more than doubled since the second quarter of 2015, according to estimates from Synergy Research Group. But at 5 percent or so, it’s still well behind Microsoft’s 12 percent and Amazon’s market-leading 43 percent. Amazon Web Services logged almost $8 billion in revenue in 2015 and is on pace to top $10 billion this year. Alphabet has yet to break out results for Google Cloud, but industry insiders estimate its sales are at most a tenth of Amazon’s. During an Oct. 27 call with investors, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said the cloud division would be one of his “largest areas” of investment and personnel growth in 2017. Jonathan Atkin, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, is skeptical about how much headway Greene can make. “Google has the raw infrastructure to be relevant in this sector, just not the DNA,” he says. An investor, who asked to remain anonymous because his venture capital firm works with Google, echoes the thought: “They don’t have the DNA to deal with a chief information officer.” For as long as it’s been around, Google’s priority has been creating software to be used by billions of individuals, which is why it has long neglected the market for business applications. Prabhakar Raghavan, a company veteran who oversees G Suite, Google’s version of Microsoft Office, recalls floating an idea for a feature that would appeal to maybe 10 million users. He says the reaction from his engineers was “Give me a break.” Shaukat says times have changed: “It’s probably a fair characterization of what we were like three or four years ago as opposed to what we are like today.” Meeting with chief information officers and other corporate executives is his “full-time job,” he says. Google is under pressure to sign up customers, because a large chunk of its cloud revenue comes from just two clients, says a former Google employee: Apple and Snapchat’s parent company, Snap. Apple has developed an internal photo-storage system dubbed McQueen to gradually end its reliance on Google and Amazon servers, say people familiar with its strategy. An investor close to Snap says it may one day take a similar route. Google and AWS have engaged in successive rounds of price-cutting to win business. As an additional inducement, Google is offering its cloud customers access to tools that incorporate artificial intelligence, such as an image-recognition feature. Several executives in Silicon Valley have lauded the offerings, but less tech-savvy companies in other industries may struggle to make use of them. “The perception from people is that Google is still quirky to use,” says Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare, a web security firm. “It’s like everyone is speaking standardized English, and Google [is] the French speaker.” The bottom line: Google’s share of the cloud market has doubled, to about 5 percent, in the past year, but AWS has 43 percent and Microsoft 12 percent.

Richard Lai , @richardlai 11.01.16 in Mobile Comments 1152 Shares Share Tweet Share Save French designer Philippe Starck and Xiaomi CEO Lei Jun holding their Mi MIX "concept phones" on the stage in Beijing. The day after the Mi Note 2 and Mi MIX launch last week, the flagship Mi Home store next to Xiaomi's headquarters was packed with visitors. Nope, they weren't there to spend their yuan, but simply to wait for their turn to play with the new phones. But the real star was clearly the Mi MIX "concept phone." People were drawn to its near-bezel-less display and fancy ceramic body. Despite this being Xiaomi's most expensive smartphone ever, I heard many visitors ask if they could buy one immediately, only to be let down when told they have to wait until Nov. 4th. Xiaomi must be doing something right The Mi MIX didn't just happen over night, of course; it was a two-year project with contributions from French designer Philippe Starck. This man is no stranger to the tech world; he's helped design headphones, hard drives, a smart radiator valve, electric bicycles and even the late Steve Jobs' yacht. Global VP Hugo Barra described Starck's role in the Mi MIX project as setting high-level priorities, especially when it came to persuading the Xiaomi team to keep things clean and simple. Xiaomi's aim with the Mi MIX is to showcase some of the breakthrough mobile technologies that will eventually trickle down to its mainstream devices. In this case, we have Sharp's near-bezel-less display, which we knew was arriving sooner or later. Hidden underneath that is Elliptic Labs' ultrasound-based proximity sensor, which replaces the ugly infrared dot and turns the screen off when the phone is placed next to your ear. Last but not least, the full ceramic body is a nice alternative to the aluminum we're accustomed to. The company hopes these experiments will lead consumers to see Xiaomi as home to serious innovation rather than a budget brand. Some would argue that it should be giants like Apple and Google bringing out devices like the Mi MIX. While Barra declined to comment on the iPhone 7, he was happy to praise his previous company's efforts with the Pixel, and even went as far as saying the series "sets a bar for the whole world." He described Google's latest phones as being "all-around optimized," "very responsive" with "great battery life" plus an "awesome camera," though he did say that they don't necessarily have the best industrial design -- especially with their "very tall chins." Could Google have done a phone like the Mi MIX? Barra defended his former colleagues, saying it would have been difficult for them to justify the risk of delivering a phone like this, as it wouldn't sell in large quantities. The Pixel, on the other hand, doesn't have this problem. "They're gonna sell a lot of Pixels. Every Android enthusiast is going to try what they can to get their hands on one." Sometimes I can't help but wonder if Barra is still working for Google. Save for the Mi Home's strong resemblance to any Apple Store, the Mi MIX could have almost peeled the copycat label off Xiaomi for good. Alas, people were quick to compare the Mi Note 2's 3D curved body to Samsung's S7 Edge and its discontinued Note 7. Barra was keen to point out that Xiaomi was actually the first company to release a smartphone with a 3D curved-glass back -- the original Mi Note. The same industrial design was applied to the smaller but more powerful Mi 5. "I'm not worried about what people are going to say." Samsung then combined the 3D curved screen and the 3D curved glass back for the S7 Edge, to which Barra said, "Well, no one is going to give us credit for a curved back, right? They just care about the front." It wasn't until the Mi Note 2 when Xiaomi followed Samsung's suit, courtesy of the flexible OLED display allegedly supplied by LG. "In how many ways do you think you can design a curved display? Exactly one way," Barra argued. "I don't think that anyone can outright claim ownership of that as an invention because it's kind of like a logical thing. They can claim that they were the first ones to do it, but certainly not the ones responsible for the most incredible idea in the world because it's just a very straightforward engineering thing: As soon as you can come up with a flexible OLED display, you can design a screen like this. "I'm not worried about what people are going to say, because we're pretty confident in our design capability. I think [the Mi MIX unveiling] was a pretty clear demonstration of that."

Knowing about these small features can make a big difference. Read More to Google Maps navigation. Google has made good progress in making Android’s text-to-speech sound less robotic, though it’s not perfect. If you rely on the speech features of your Android phone often but have a hard time understanding it, here’s how to adjust how it sounds. Head into Settings and scroll down to the Accessibility menu under the System header. Next, find Text-to-speech output near the bottom of this menu. Once here, you’ll be able to adjust the speech rate and pitch of the speaking voice. The default is a good blend of a natural pace while still being easy to understand. If you want to slow it down, go ahead and drag the Speech rate down a bit. You probably won’t need to change the Pitch, but don’t be afraid to experiment if you like. There’s a button at the bottom to play a sample of audio, and you can reset either setting with one tap. That’s not the only setting you can change here. Tap the gear icon next to Google Text-to-speech Engine, then Settings for Google Text-to-speech Engine to change a few more options. Turning on Amplify speech volume makes speech louder than usual so you can hear it more easily. If you’d like the speech to sound more robotic, change the Intonation from Expressive to Somewhat expressive or Flat.

Reply Alan November 4, 2016 at 3:42 pm Not mentioned in the article is that Android also supports 3rd party Text To Speech voices. SVOX and Cereproc have excellent voices, male, female, accents, and languages. (There are other vendors as well, but these two have the most variety, and I have used both with excellent results. that being said, I no longer use them because the Google voice has gotten so good in the past couple of years, and my wife thought the British accent SVOX one I was using sounded too pretentious). Reply Ben Stegner November 4, 2016 at 5:44 pm Thanks for mentioning this! In a shorter post I didn't have room to bring up alternative voice services, but I agree with you. I tried a different app to for text-to-speech a year or two ago, but Google's is fantastic now, so there's not much of a need.

For example, an app maker could allow potential users to try out the subscription at $1 for the first three months, then bump them to the regular price once the trial was over. Google also noted that consumer spending in subscription apps had increased by an impressive ten times over the past three years. In the same post, Google stated that its new pre-registration feature, offered in partnership with select popular mobile titles like Clash Royale and Candy Crush Jelly Saga, had already driven 30 million installs after launching earlier this year. Similarly, titles enrolled in Early Access, an open beta program in which developers can get feedback from early adopters, have seen over four million installs. Any avid mobile gamers interested in checking out Early Access titles can enroll here.

In the meantime, the company has implemented a something else to speed up Chrome: Profile Guided Optimization. 11 Ways to Speed Up Google Chrome 11 Ways to Speed Up Google Chrome One of the most popular web browsers users love is Google Chrome, yet in spite of all the…Read more Originally a feature found on Microsoft’s Visual Studio developer tools, Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) is a technology that tracks user interaction with an application. Some functions are used more, others less. With PGO, functions that are used more often will be optimized for speed, while less-used functions are optimized with smaller, slightly slower code. The result is a smaller overall code footprint and a faster Chrome. Optimizations are also done to the memory location of the code as PGO would move rarely-used functions away from those that are frequently-used. This results in better management of the CPU instruction cache by avoiding caching of less-used code, resulting in better performance. PGO impact on load and startup time New tab page load time 14.8% faster Page load (time to first paint) 5.9% faster Startup time 16.8% faster In terms of numbers, a Chrome build that has PGO would be 15% faster overall on Windows compared to a Chrome build without PGO. For those who are fans of better performing Chrome browsers, Build 53 is what you’re looking for if you use the 64-bit version of Chrome. If you’re on a 32-bit version of the browser, Build 54 is the build to go for. Pin it With PGO now available on current Chrome builds, and with Chrome 55 coming soon, it seems that Google has finally decided to cut some fat off of its browser, something that has been long overdue.

Think of an austere, windowless room filled with massive metallic machines. All are hooked together with multi-colored wires and covered in lights that blink at random. What metaphor would you use to describe that? Odds are, you wouldn’t say, “A cloud.” In reality, “the cloud” doesn’t refer to the data center itself but to how companies use the resources of the data center to deliver massive compute power as a service over the Internet. Here’s a review of where the cloud came from, its role in DevOps and new trends in cloud development that could unleash massive market disruptions as soon as 2017. Cloud Origins Many organizations have used the term “cloud computing,” or the engineering symbol of a cloud on schematic diagrams, to represent an unspecified pathway of various server resources connected over the Internet. As a business model and a searchable keyword, cloud computing started becoming popular after Google’s Eric Schmidt used the term at a Search Engine Strategies Conference in 2006. Schmidt said, “There is an emergent new model, and you all are here because you are part of that new model. I don’t think people have really understood how big this opportunity really is. It starts with the premise that the data services and architecture should be on servers. We call it cloud computing – they should be in a “cloud” somewhere. And that if you have the right kind of browser or the right kind of access, it doesn’t matter whether you have a PC or a Mac or a mobile phone or a BlackBerry or what have you – or new devices still to be developed – you can get access to the cloud. There are a number of companies that have benefited from that. Obviously, Google, Yahoo!, eBay, Amazon come to mind.” Rapid Growth Stage In that same talk, Schmidt said that the cloud was available 10 years earlier, but people were just beginning to understand its potential due to advances in advertising. His suggestion is supported by a report from MIT scholars in 1996 that introduced the “confederated approach” business model for Internet-based businesses, including a “cloud of intermediate networks.” In 2008, cloud computing was a nascent industry with investments from Amazon, Microsoft, Salesforce and many others. Gartner defined the cloud that year as “a style of computing where massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided ‘as a service’ using Internet technologies to multiple external customers.” Spending for cloud services, especially computer, storage and virtual infrastructure, hit $47 billion by 2013 and it’s now on track to reach $107 billion in 2017. It’s important to realize, though, there is not a single cloud like there is a single Internet. There are actually many, many clouds, both public and private. Public vs. Private vs. Hybrid Clouds It’s a mistake to talk about the cloud provisioning market like a single monolithic industry. It’s really made up of a wide variety of hardware vendors, developers, solution providers and channel partners. The characteristics of public clouds are very different from private clouds, although many vendors say they offer both. Hybrid refers to any combination of public and private clouds in various amounts within a single deployment. In the public cloud, everyone from global enterprises to individual consumers can rent the power of global data center networks. The biggest benefit is instant access to vast compute power without capital expenses. You can pay for processing resources as they are used or even by the hour. The world of the public cloud is dominated by Amazon’s AWS (Amazon Web Services) EC2. Close behind AWS are the Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure and Rackspace. The private cloud puts a piece of the cloud behind firewalls for use by an individual company. It can be implemented on the company’s on-premise servers or hosted virtually at the cloud provider’s data center. The private cloud is much more expensive than public, but it also gives companies more options for tuning their environments. How DevOps Uses the Cloud The cloud makes life easier for developer teams thanks to PaaS (Platform as a Service) options like Heroku. These save time on system setup and deployment so there’s no need to build and tear down development servers. You’ve got a sandbox whenever you need it. For developers who need more control, there are IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) hosting options like Digital Ocean. These are essentially bare metal servers with virtual environments that can replicated easily and tuned to match a variety of testing configurations. Cloud hosting environments like these have become the default home for the majority of distributed software. The IDC reports that 85 percent of new software being built today is destined for the cloud. On the operations side, the cloud allows smaller enterprises to take advantage of the vast resources devoted to security by large cloud providers. Access to massive failover capabilities means that software-defined processes running in the cloud are better protected from network traffic spikes or DDoS attacks that threaten company servers. The cloud also makes it possible to manage application performance monitoring data from anywhere. That translates directly into more preventative measures and less downtime. Enterprises Built on Clouds While the global marketplace has been rocked by digital transformation, many businesses have found ways to reinvent themselves and regain their standing using applications in the cloud. Cloud apps include popular business services providers and productivity boosters that can be accessed on any device and scaled as needed. Top cloud apps for business include Dropbox for making document storage mobile, Evernote for searchable notation center, InsightSquared Analytics for instant data reporting capabilities and Geopointe for managing sales teams. Many enterprises have deployed cloud solutions to simplify digital transformation over the past few years. One good example in a traditional industry involves Delhaize America, owner of grocery chains such as Food Lion and Bottom Dollar. They applied cloud-based analytics to aggregate purchasing data. They found that purchases of certain magazines and types of grilling meat was correlated with specific temperatures. This helped them better manage their inventory and significantly curtail operating expenses. The Arrival of a Personal Cloud The biggest news on the cloud front, however, is something that many independent app developers have been discussing for years: a fully functional cloud hosting platform designed for a single individual or small team. Antsle was just introduced as a small, completely silent home server with the power of 100 virtual servers. It gives independent developers full access to their own private cloud with a total monthly hosting cost of $0. Take a look at some of Antsle’s most impressive capabilities: The AntsleOS and Antman manager to support virtual machines (VMs) called antlets. Antlets are based on containers, with full KVM virtualization and RAM can be shared between Antlets. Each VM can use any OS. If you want to, you can test out apps on Linux, SmartOS, Windows, BSD or whatever else you need at the moment. The Antsle box uses a custom-built Linux Kernel for optimal application performance management. It also uses ZFS (the fault-tolerant file system), error-correcting RAM, mirrored SSDs for instant failover without loss of data. It also supports LXC, KVM and libvert. Trend Convergence in the Personal Cloud What’s most interesting about Antsle is how it brings together several trends in next generation infrastructure development. First of all, it’s open source and built by crowdfunding. The initial funding for Antsle came from an Indiegogo campaign. Another recent trend is the heightened sensitivity to government surveillance and exposure to cybercrime. Bernie Bloom, Antsle’s CEO, explained that this technology was inspired by reports of back doors into private data at large hosting companies. “Let’s face it – you never know what they do with your data,” Bloom said. “Hosters are under government surveillance. They rely on advertising to make money based on your data. As a developer, I can say I just feel much better if my code and data is on an Antsle in my home, and *I* decide if and when that data leaves my home.” Democratizing the Cloud The real test for Antsle will be in 2017, when the company plans to support 2,000 apps and directly address the general consumer market. At $699 each, Antsle boxes make sense for businesses right now that can post ROI from eliminating their monthly hosting fees. However, to appeal to consumers they’ll need to a much lower price point or make a compelling case for privacy. If they succeed, Antsle and companies like them could democratize the compute powers of the cloud, just as the web democratized information two decades ago. In that case, the digital disruption the world has witnessed so far will pale in comparison with what’s to come.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Don’t Miss Out: How to Use Google’s New Mobile Testing Tool Mobile Search August 1, 2016 Mobile Search Amanda DiSilvestroAugust 1, 2016 VIP CONTRIBUTOR 817SHARES 2.1KREADS 817SHARES 2.1KREADS VIP CONTRIBUTORAmanda DiSilvestro 817SHARES 2.1KREADS Google’s original mobile testing tool came out in 2014, and two years in the land of technology might as well be a lifetime. It was about time they came out with an update, and I’m happy to say it was worth the wait. According to Google, “people are five times more likely to leave a mobile site that isn’t mobile-friendly,” and “nearly half of all visitors will leave a mobile site if the pages don’t load within 3 seconds.” In other, more blatant words, it’s imperative that business owners optimize their sites for mobile. Read below to find out how to use the newest version of Google’s mobile testing tool and make sure your website is meeting the needs of your mobile customers. How to Get the New Google Mobile Testing Tool First things first: you can access the tool from Google’s Search Console’s mobile usability report. Either way, once you’ve arrived at the tool, it’s as simple as entering your website’s URL into the search box, clicking “test now”, and waiting for the results. The home screen will look something like this: Then, once you enter a URL, your results page will look something like this: How to Interpret the Google Mobile Testing Tool Results So now you know how to access the tool (it’s pretty self-explanatory and easy to use, thanks to Google!). Next, you need to know what those results mean. A test is worthless if you can’t use the results to make positive improvements. In terms of the screenshot above, Google makes it pretty clear that the site is mobile friendly. The big green 99/100 rating for mobile friendliness is a pretty big giveaway. If you’re not looking for an in-depth analysis of your site, this might be just enough information to make you happy and send you on your way. However, you’d be missing out on some of the tool’s (not-so-hidden) features that could help improve your mobile site even more. You’ll notice in the shot above that next to the mobile friendliness rating are ratings for mobile and desktop speed. Although Express scored high in the overall rating, they didn’t fare so well when it came to speed. This is just one example of the added information you get with the newest version of this tool. If this was my site and my ratings, the first thing I’d work on fixing would be the speed of my site on both mobile and desktop. One of the big differences between the old version of the tool and the updated version is that you now have access to this added information; in the past, all the tool said was whether or not your site was mobile friendly. Now, users have much more detailed information in the form of a 0-100-scale rating that discusses mobile friendliness, but also mobile and desktop speed. Additional Features of the Google Mobile Testing Tool Besides the new rating scale and the fact that you can get all three scores on one screen, Google has made another big change; they give you the option to have a comprehensive report sent to you that you can share with your team. If you click that button, a screen will appear that looks something like this: Google is nice enough to give you some mobile tips in an easy-to-read, easy-to-understand format even before receiving your free report (which they promise will arrive within 24 hours). Here is a report that I had sent to me for amandadisilvestro.com: You can see that in the area where I scored poorly (mobile speed), Google tells me exactly what needs to be fixed. They even provide links that lead to technical support in case the team needs help fixing the problem. They’re pretty much taking the guesswork out of the whole thing, so truly optimizing a mobile site has never been this painless. Possible Critiques of the Google Mobile Testing Tool I do think it is interesting, and worth noting, that while there is a ton of information out there about how the tool works and how to use it, there isn’t a lot of information that explains the algorithm the tool uses in order to determine the three different ratings. All I was really able to determine was that it looks at things like CSS, HTML, scripts, and images and then evaluates how quickly (or slowly) it takes for your website to load. So how do they determine where your site falls on the rating scale? Perhaps by how long it takes for your site to load past the 3-second mark, which they claim is the attention span people have for waiting on mobile sites. (Ironically enough, it takes longer than three seconds for Google’s site to complete its test.) I became even more skeptical after coming across this article by Search Engine Watch. They did some more extensive tests and found that their site, along with Forbes, and many other sites, all received “poor” ratings for both mobile and desktop speed. In fact, the only site they could find that received good scores in all three categories was Google. When I did the test myself, I received the same results, as you can see below: I hate to be a skeptic and go around touting a conspiracy theory, but what’s up with that Google? Are all the other mobile sites out there really inferior to yours, or are you just trying to drum up business for your new tool? Regardless of the critiques or potential fishy-ness happening, the tool is easy to use and is something I would recommend. After all, it’s free, and if you truly don’t believe what you see, then you don’t have to make any changes. If nothing else, it gets you thinking. What do you think of Google’s new tool? Was your site able to score a “good” in more than one category?

Google Play store unwraps new ways to subscribe, pay CNET 04/11/2016 Richard Nieva © Provided by CNET Google announced updates to its Play Store. James Martin/CNET Google's Android software powers almost 9 out of every 10 smartphones in the world. Now Google is hoping its app store can keep up. The search giant is making changes to Google Play, its online marketplace where you can download apps and games, Google said during a software developer event in San Francisco on Thursday. The company is also making a big push at hooking in users in emerging markets.  The updates are centered around how customers can subscribe and pay for services available on Google Play. For example, app makers can now choose different promotional prices for subscriptions, like offering a service for $1 a month for a few months, before bumping it up to the normal subscription price. Google also touted its efforts to make it easier for people in emerging markets to pay for stuff on Google Play. The company has expanded its "direct carrier billing" feature, said Sameer Samat, vice president of product management for Android & Google Play. When using that option, charges for apps and other downloads from the Play Store show up on a customer's phone bill, instead of being charged to a credit card. The company introduced the feature back in 2010, but Samat said Google has added or improved it in several new markets, including Malaysia, Kuwait and Vietnam. Now 600 million people globally can choose the option, he told CNET. "As the next billion users come online, many with little or no access to credit cards, we want to help deliver the best payments experience for both developers and consumers," Samat said in an email. The changes come as tech giants aggressively try to expand their user bases in the developing world. Many of those new users will be people only recently coming online, or only accessing the internet through their phones, and not desktop computers. Elsewhere at Alphabet, Google's parent, the company is trying to shore up new users in emerging markets through a project called Loon, in which high-flying balloons beam down internet access to remote regions. Facebook is doing the same thing with drones. The app store revamp also comes after Apple, Google's biggest rival in the smartphone software business, made several changes to its App Store for iPhones earlier this year. Apple's updates included changes in subscriptions and trying to make sure apps get approved more quickly. Google on Thursday also talked up its "early access" program, which lets software developers put their apps on Google Play for a small number of users to test the apps before they launch. Google said the program has seen 4 million downloads since the company made it widely available in September.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Friday, 4 November 2016 | MYT 5:11 PM Google rejects new EU antitrust charges Categorically denied: Google filed objections against beefed up charges made by hard-charging European Commission competition chief Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. — Reuters BRUSSELS: US Internet giant Google rejected new EU accusations that it illegally abuses its market dominance, in its formal reaction to antitrust allegations by Brussels earlier this year.  Google filed objections against beefed up charges made by hard-charging European Commission competition chief Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services.  Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, said in a blog that the shopping case “still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online.”  ”We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” Walker said.  The EU now has three cases on the go against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager in a campaign that has raised hackles on the other side of the Atlantic.  The biggest and most recent case involves Google’s Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company’s most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs.  Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week.  The second and oldest case involves Google’s alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged in 2015, and then this July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding.  Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services.  Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party websites.  That case concerns Google’s AdSense service where websites can install a customised search engine on their site which generates revenue from having relevant ads appear on the search results page.   ‘Interests of consumers’  The European Commission, confirming it had received the response to the shopping and Adsense cases, said it “will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.”  The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably.   Instead, the cases have raised tensions between the Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald’s.  The European Commission, which polices EU competition policy, launched an initial investigation into Google in 2010 following complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and Trip Advisor that it favoured its own services when customers ran searches.  ”We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers,” said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case.  Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort.  Since that time, attitudes in Europe towards Google have deteriorated after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Silicon Valley giants had provided troves of personal data to US intelligence. — AFP You May Be Interested The Nintendo Wii turns 10 years old Zuckerberg again rejects claims of Facebook impact on US election Two major Russian banks say hit by cyberattacks Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

He's the author of the Canadian bestseller A Daytripper's Guide to Manitoba: Exploring Canada's Undiscovered Province and co-author of Stuck in the Middle: Dissenting Views of Winnipeg. His work has also appeared in publications such as the Guardian and Explore magazine. ​Winnipeg is poised to sign a deal with Google to allow the the tech giant to access real-time traffic information and disseminate it through its Waze app.  City transportation managers are seeking council approval to allow the 311 system, the transportation management centre and public works crews to give Google access to information about traffic accidents, lane closures, traffic congestion and other hazards. Waze, which functions like another layer of Google Maps, already accesses traffic information from Montreal, Los Angeles and other North American cities. Montreal 1st Canadian city to exchange traffic data with Waze app Shortcut-finding app Waze creating residential traffic headaches​ The free app gathers information from both official sources and its users, transportation manager Luis Escobar wrote in a report that came before council's public works committee on Monday. "Waze differs from traditional GPS navigation software in that it is community-driven: gathering complementary map data and traffic information from its users. Like other GPS software, it learns from users' driving times to provide routing and real-time traffic updates," Escobar wrote.  "People can report accidents, traffic jams, speed and lane closures. By connecting drivers to one another, Waze helps people create local driving communities that work together to improve the quality of everyone's daily driving." Escobar is proposing a one-year deal that can be renewed automatically or cancelled by either party. There are no financial implications associated with the deal, he wrote. In a separate report to council, public works is requesting an additional $660,000 from the city to complete its transportation management centre. That project now has a $3.7-million budget. The additional money is needed to conduct "unforeseen work" required to modify public works' traffic signals branch building on Elgin Avenue as well as to cover the rising cost of equipment whose price has been affected by the Canada-U.S. dollar exchange rate.

Google rejects new EU charges Technology Friday 4 November 2016 - 10:06am US internet giant Google has rejected new EU accusations that it illegally abuses its market dominance, in its formal reaction to anti-trust allegations.

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Files BRUSSELS – US internet giant Google on Thursday rejected new EU accusations that it illegally abuses its market dominance, in its formal reaction to anti-trust allegations by Brussels earlier this year.

The Google Pixel, iPhone 7 Plus, and Moto Z go head to head, from a traveler's perspective. Nikki Ekstein More stories by Nikki Ekstein November 4, 2016 — 5:00 AM EDT November 4, 2016 — 5:00 AM EDT Source (from left): Apple; Google; Motorola Let me begin by saying this: I’m not a professional photographer. I have a slightly better-than-101 understanding of how cameras work and why things such as sensor size and f-stops matter. Looking at tech specs is far from my idea of an engaging read. As a travel editor, I do love taking pictures, though. And I take tons of them—thousands and thousands on any given trip, almost entirely on smartphones. I take my Instagram game seriously and occasionally have images published here, on the very site you’re reading. For years, I’ve been so dependent on mobile photography that I’ve committed to carrying around two phones—one, an Android, that’s easier to type on, and the other, an iPhone, that has stronger apps and a killer camera. For the last few weeks, I carried three: Google’s Pixel, the iPhone 7 Plus, and the Moto Z, the latest entrants to the mobile photography race. (The Moto has flown largely under the radar, but its key selling point is its compatibility with magnetic "mods" that include a portable speaker and an attachable Hasselblad 4116 True Zoom camera.) We are living in the first true golden era of smartphone photography. A photo posted by Nikki Ekstein (@nikkiekstein) on Sep 16, 2016 at 2:33am PDT   But that's not why you're here. You want to know which one is the best. And, well, that answer is a bit complicated—after five head-to-head layman’s tests, where I focused on experience and results (hardware specs be damned), I'd be happy with any of them.  How to live the good life.

You will now receive the Technology newsletter This is not a cop-out as much it is a recognition that I’m probably a lot like you when it comes to my smartphone camera: All I want is for it to take good pictures, quickly, clearly, and without much effort. If I wanted a real camera, I'd get one of these new mirrorless, DSLR, and rugged models. But with my phone, as long as I can compose a decent shot whenever there’s a great subject in view, and whatever the given situation is, I’d like to think my phone can meet me the rest of the way. Here's how each performed against key selling points. All you have to do is determine your top priorities before your next upgrade.    If You Need ... Auto-Focus Images of Prospect Park in Brooklyn, N.Y., shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Moto Z, respectively. Photographer: Nikki Ekstein/Bloomberg The idea of never missing a shot is what really drives mobile photography; it’s why every phone has shortcuts for opening the camera app. But that quick-draw image is no good unless it’s in focus. My auto-focus tests were conducted both in daylight and at dusk, with both fast-moving and still subjects. Winner: The iPhone 7 Plus won for crispest images across the board. Even when I was snapping from the window of a moving car, it managed to deliver beautifully defined shots of the Manhattan skyline—one frame after the next. (Very Close) Runners-up: The Pixel more or less flopped from the moving car window, but take out the fast-moving subject, and man, does that phone shine. In both daylight and low light, the auto-focus performed faster than those of its competitors, never taking more than a second to go from blur to fab. The Moto Z fell in between. Two out of three frames on the Manhattan bridge came out clearly; everywhere else, I really appreciated the fact that the Hasselblad attachment lets you trigger its autofocus with a halfway press of the shutter button, just as on a real camera. It’s way easier than repeatedly touching the screen and makes one-handed shooting a breeze.   If You Need ... Low Light Handling Jack O'Lantern sculptures shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Moto Z, respectively. Photographer: Nikki Ekstein/Bloomberg Luckily for the purposes of my experiment, I was able to head to the Great Jack O'Lantern Blaze, a spooky pumpkin festival in the Hudson Valley, ahead of the Halloween weekend, with all three phones in tow. Winner: The Pixel—no contest. It did a commanding job of focusing quickly in low light and offering warm (but accurate) color balance. It had a stronger dynamic range, by far, which is what kept the red foliage in check in the background. You’ll also be thankful for these features in dimly lit restaurants. Runners-up: While the MotoZ offered color that felt truer to life, the iPhone7 offered a sharper low-light image.   If You Need ... a Powerful Zoom Architectural details shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Moto Z, respectively. Photographer: Nikki Ekstein/Bloomberg Usually, if I need a great zoom, I’m not relying on my smartphone. But that’s starting to change. Both the MotoZ (with its Hasselblad attachment) and the iPhone 7 Plus have a 10x zoom capability, whereas the Pixel is limited to 4x. Winner: MotoZ, which I was able to use to get a crisp shot of the third-floor lettering on the side of an Upper East Side Synagogue from across the street. That’s because the attachable camera has a proper optical zoom lens that you won’t find on any other phone camera—not just a digital zoom that works by tightening the crop of your shot. The difference here was palpable. Runner-up: The iPhone still has an exceptional zoom capacity—even if its 10x range is purely digital. But pushing it to the edge means you’re likely to get a blurry shot. That’s still better than the Pixel, whose zoom fell flat by comparison.   If You Need ... Great Portraits The author's Bernese Mountain Dog, Riley, shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Moto Z, respectively. Photographer: Nikki Ekstein/Bloomberg Pets and babies: They’re two of the most common subjects for smartphone photographers. So even if you’re not getting beautiful street style portraits, this is a feature that you’ll use on the regular. Winner: The iPhone 7 Plus has a portrait mode that is designed to deliver flattering depth of field. (Read: Your background is softened while your subject is in clear view.) The result is really as beautiful as they make it sound. Getting there requires a little legwork, but thankfully, the phone will coach you through it: It tells you if you need more light or more distance from your subject. Sometimes you’re straight out of luck. But when it works, it really works wonders. Runners-up: Even though the MotoZ has two dedicated portrait modes (one for night portraits and the other to correct backlighting), I struggled to capture my dog’s eyes or to get fully focused shots of her face. The Pixel, meanwhile, has no fancy portrait mode. But remember that excellent auto-correct? It helps deliver lovely portrait shots in a pinch.   If You Need ... Macro Mode Very delicious rugelach shot with the iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Moto Z, respectively. Photographer: Nikki Ekstein/Bloomberg Please forgive me: I took a bite of one cookie before I found my favorite composition. (It was delicious and fresh out of the oven.) Winner(s): The MotoZ, maybe, by a hair. The three images are almost identical. That’s why I conducted a follow-up test, albeit a less visually interesting one: shooting the backside of a coin. I got the tightest shot with the MotoZ, with the iPhone coming in as a close second place. The Pixel struggled. Good thing nobody needs photos of a penny, anyway.   Watch Next A Pro Photographer Reviews the iPhone 7 Plus   Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

(w/video) By BRIAN X. CHEN, New York Times BRIAN X. CHENTampa Bay Times Friday, November 4, 2016 5:34am Print 0 My Edition I want to see more articles tagged I'm already following articles tagged To get an idea of how annoying it can be to say "Okay, Google" multiple times a day, try replacing the word Google with another brand. Related News/Archive Research shows you may have to dig for the lowest prices on Amazon 5 Months Ago You don't always save with Amazon's Subscribe & Save program 2 Months Ago How you can crush the video interview 6 Months Ago Okay, Pepsi. Okay, Chipotle. Okay, Skittles. You get the picture. It's difficult to utter "Okay, Google," the phrase used to control Google's new Home smart speaker, without sounding like a marketing tool. That is too bad because Google's Home is otherwise a preternaturally smarter speaker than its closest rival, Amazon's Echo. Google is releasing Home on Friday in the hope of riding the coattails of Echo, the Amazon gadget that is powered by the virtual assistant called Alexa. Echo became available last year to much fanfare. By posing questions and making requests to Alexa, people have since put Echo to work as a shopping assistant, kitchen companion and home automation tool. Amazon has a bona fide hardware hit. So Google created a similar smart speaker powered by the omniscient brains of Google search. To see how Home compares with Echo, I grilled both Alexa and Google side by side for six days. I tested the speakers in categories that they shared in common: music, trivia, dining, entertainment and the smart home. What I found was that while Echo is more capable than Home, partly because a larger number of third-party companies have worked with Amazon to add capabilities to its speaker, Google's product is poised to surpass Echo in the coming years. Home's link to Google's database of information means it will most likely be able to give superior answers in the future. In addition, music played from Home sounds clearer and its virtual assistant is a better listener than Alexa. So for those deciding between the two products, I recommend waiting to see if Home expands its abilities before making a purchase. POP QUIZ All virtual assistants, which are backed by artificial intelligence, are still fairly dumb, including Google's Assistant, Apple's Siri, Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. But Google's Assistant is smarter than Alexa. Just give them both a pop quiz to see. A competent virtual assistant should be able to answer all sorts of arbitrary questions. Is Pluto a planet? Was Bill Murray in any TV shows? How do I build a bee trap? Amazon's Alexa was not able to answer those questions. But Google's Home speaker yanked an answer from its vast database of online search results. Pluto is a dwarf planet. Bill Murray was in Saturday Night Live. And to make a bee catcher, you cut the top off a bottle, flip over the top and staple it onto the bottom part of the bottle. Amazon declined to comment. Occasionally there are times when Google gets stumped while Alexa succeeds. Asked who was ahead in the presidential polls, Google's Assistant had no answer. But Alexa said Hillary Clinton was polling at 45.1 percent and Donald J. Trump at 43.1 percent. Most of the time, however, Google has answers when Alexa fails. Why would Assistant not produce a response when the answers are out there from a quick Google search? Rishi Chandra, a vice president for product management at Google, said that when Google could confidently answer a question, Home would respond appropriately. But when it is less certain, it won't offer a guess. "We don't want to presume an answer that may not be right," he said. "We're being really cautious with this feature." SMART HOME Google's speaker is called Home because of a vision that the gadget will work with many devices in someone's residence, be it a coffee maker or a garage door opener. Yet on Day 1, the speaker will work with products from only three smart home companies. Those include Nest, the thermostat maker owned by Google's parent company Alphabet; SmartThings, Samsung's smart home accessories maker; and Philips, which offers smart lighting systems called Hue. Missing from Home is support for smart home products from companies like Honeywell, TP-Link and LIFX, all of which are supported by Echo. With Home, I managed to get Google's Assistant to control my Hue smart lights. The setup was relatively easy but ran into some problems: The Home app detected four lights when I actually had two. I wasn't able to hook up my Honeywell smart thermostat or my TP-Link smart plug for controlling my coffee maker with Home because of Google's lack of support for the devices. Google said that for Home's release, it focused on getting Nest, SmartThings and Hue because they were the largest smart home companies on the market. More partnerships are to come. MUSIC AND PODCASTS One major purpose of smart speakers is to play music and radio programs. Both speakers were good at serving tunes and radio programs from popular services and stations, but Home was superior. For playing music from my Spotify account, both Home and Echo were adept at playing songs from popular artists like Sia, Radiohead and Bon Iver. Home was generally better at understanding requests to play specific Spotify playlists or soundtracks. For example, asking the speakers to play the soundtrack for the film Drive resulted in Home playing the correct soundtrack, but Alexa played the album 2014 Forest Hills Drive by J. Cole. For podcasts, both speakers were adequate — but again, Home was better. Alexa could play better-known podcasts like "Fresh Air"or "Radio Lab," but it failed to play "The Sporkful," a less popular podcast. Google could play just about any podcast I asked for. Google also came out ahead in this category because of sound quality. Both speakers sound good, but Home sounds louder and clearer, with deeper bass. In my tests, Home also did a better job taking requests while the speaker played loud music, whereas Alexa often seemed deaf. DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT On the down side, Alexa and Home are fairly lacking when it comes to requests related to food and entertainment. The Google speaker does not have the capability to place orders for delivery food. Alexa can order a pizza from Domino's, but otherwise can't do much else for delivery orders. Neither speaker can book a table for a restaurant nearby. Still, both assistants excelled in detailing places to eat in the area. Asking them to find Chinese food nearby prompted them to list some local Chinese restaurants. Google did better here by also listing the street where the restaurants are. One task Alexa can pull off that Google can't is list showtimes for movies playing in the neighborhood. Chandra, the Google executive, said Home would add movie showtimes eventually. As for placing delivery orders, he said Google was working with other companies on designing an experience that works with voice  you wouldn't want a voice assistant listing 50 menu items, for instance. "If you verbally spit out what's on the screen, then it's not going to work," he said. BOTTOM LINE Echo and Home are largely the same in the basic tasks they can perform. The capabilities Home lacks, like movie showtimes or support for other smart home accessories, will probably show up in software updates or future partnerships. So what really distinguishes one from the other? Right now, Echo's major advantage is its ability to order items from Amazon.com and its broader smart home capabilities. If you like the idea of using a speaker to quickly reorder diapers or toilet paper, or if you are eager to get a speaker to control home accessories like lights and thermostats, Echo is a better product for you. But if you aren't big on Amazon shopping and can wait a few months to see how Home evolves, Google's speaker may be your long-term bet because of its smarter artificial intelligence and superior audio player. Home, priced at about $130, is also cheaper than Amazon's $180 Echo. Let's just hope Google eventually gives people more ways to talk to its speaker other than "Okay, Google." (The only other option is "Hey, Google.") It gets so tedious that you may eventually say, "Okay, I'm over this."

The fresh claims from the European Union involve the search firm's online shopping and advertising services. But Google has fought back, claiming the EU does not understand the legal and economic basis of the claims. 'Ultimately, we can't agree with a case that lacks evidence and would limit our ability to serve our users, just to satisfy the interests of a small number of websites,' it said. Scroll down for video  EU commissioners have accused Google of boosting its own online shopping services in search results to choke out competition Google filed objections against beefed up charges made by the European Commission's competition chief Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. But the web giant has hit back against the claims. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Welcome Home: Watch Google's $130 smart speaker take on...

Share this article Share Writing in a blog post, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, Kent Walker, said the shopping case 'still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online.' 'We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,' Walker said. The European Commission said it 'will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.' Pictured is President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker WHY IS GOOGLE IN TROUBLE WITH THE EU?  The claims around Google stem from anti-competition law. Brussels has taken issue with the Internet search giant over its online shopping and advertising services.   The European Commission has argued on three separate anti-trust points. Online shopping: The issues surrounds Google's shopping search results, which commissioners claim push its products over other competitors. AdSense: Google uses this service to place targeted adverts on other sites using its search bar, generating revenue. Android OS: The third of the anti-trust cases brought against Google surrounds the use of its Android operating system, which the case complains acts as a 'Trojan horse' to push its products and services. The stakes are huge, with Google potentially facing a fine of billions of pounds if it is found to be at fault.  The EU now has three cases on the go against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager in a campaign that has raised hackles on the other side of the Atlantic. The biggest and most recent case involves Google's Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company's most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs. Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week. The second and oldest case involves Google's alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged in 2015, and then this July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding. Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party websites. That case concerns Google's AdSense service where websites can install a customised search engine on their site which generates revenue from having relevant ads appear on the search results page.  The European Commission, confirming it had received the response to the shopping and Adsense cases, said it 'will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.' In its counterclaims, Google has drawn attention to the Commission's exclusion of other giants in the field, including Amazon. Google said it, and others, were chasing Amazon, which it called 'by far the largest player in the field' The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably. Instead, the cases have raised tensions between the Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald's. The European Commission, which polices EU competition policy, launched an initial investigation into Google in 2010 following complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and Trip Advisor that it favoured its own services when customers ran searches. 'We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers,' said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case. Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. Since that time, attitudes in Europe towards Google have deteriorated after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Silicon Valley giants had provided troves of personal data to US intelligence.

Image: Maria Babak/Shutterstock An anti-competition case brought by the EU Commission against Google has been rebuffed by the search giant, claiming Amazon and Facebook are getting off scot-free. “Ultimately, we can’t agree with a case that lacks evidence and would limit our ability to serve our users, just to satisfy the interests of a small number of websites.” So said Kent Walker, Google’s SVP and general counsel, in a strong rebuttal called ‘Improving quality isn’t anti-competitive’. Walker was responding to an ongoing challenge that began when the European Commission opened an investigation six years ago, on the back of complaints from Microsoft and other rival companies. The Commission contends that Google unfairly promotes its shopping service and blocks rivals in online-search advertising, something which the company could face billions of euro in fines for, should the final ruling agree. Walker said the Commission’s original statement of objections “drew such a narrow definition around online shopping” that it meant the likes of online shopping behemoth Amazon were excluded. “It claimed that when we offered improved shopping ads to our users and advertisers, we were ‘favouring’ our own services – and that this was bad for a handful of price-comparison aggregators who claimed to have lost clicks from Google,” he said. “But it failed to take into account the competitive significance of companies like Amazon and the broader dynamics of online shopping.” Walker said Google isn’t ‘favouring’ anything, it was merely listening to its customers. The latest Commission statement of objections, posted during the summer, responded to these claims by arguing Amazon is not a fair comparison, due to its role in paying price-comparison websites for its traffic. This isn’t good enough for Google, with Walker pointing out that the route to buying products online isn’t as simple as a quick search and a purchase. As Google has grown, he said, websites such as Amazon or eBay have seen their traffic grow in a complementary fashion. The EU executive said it had received Google’s response, claiming it would “carefully consider” it before making a final decision, just as it does “in each case”. A separate charge against Google’s online-search advertising product, AdSense for search, has also been filed, which too, has been challenged by the company. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if they are found guilty of breaching EU rules, according to Reuters. The penalty could reach €6.6bn, or 10pc of the company’s global turnover for each case. Google.

Stephen Phillips, who voted for Britain to leave the EU, blamed “significant policy differences” between himself and the government for his decision to quit as MP for Sleaford and North Hykeham, in Lincolnshire. Last month Phillips told the Guardian he was angry about the way the government was handling Brexit. In an article for the paper he wrote: “Not giving parliament the chance, before article 50 is invoked, to say where it thinks these negotiations should end up is, at its core, undemocratic, unconstitutional and likely to exacerbate the divisions in our society to which the referendum gave rise.” There has been mounting speculation that Phillips’ resignation will prompt an early election. But Downing Street said the PM’s position that there should not be a general election before 2020 remained unchanged. Theresa May has reassured Angela Merkel and Jean-Claude Juncker that she is determined to stick to her timetable of triggering article 50 to leave the EU by the end of March, despite the ruling.“She confirmed that the timetable remains the same,” a spokesman said Foreign secretary Boris Johnson has urged Europe to ignore “sturm und drang” in parliament over the high court ruling. Speaking in Berlin after meeting his German counterpart Johnson also insisted that the ruling would not interfere with the timetable for triggering article 50. There is widespread alarm about press hostility to the judges who ruled that parliament should trigger article 50. LibDem leader Tim Farron said today’s front pages are as “depressing as they are irresponsible”. Labour called on justice secretary Liz Truss to condemn “hysterical” attacks on the judiciary. Brendan Cox, the husband of the murdered Labour MP Jo Cox, tweeted that “inciting hatred has consequences”. A narrow majority now wants the UK to remain in the EU, according to a new poll by BMG. It found that 45% now back remain compared to 43% for leave, with 12% saying they don’t know. Ukip leadership candidate Suzanne Evans has announced that she is seeking the party’s nomination for the Sleaford byelection. She told BBC Radio 4’s World At One: “I would like to throw my hat into the ring.” One of the other contenders to replace Nigel Farage as leader of Ukip has pulled out of the race. London assembly member Peter Whittle declared he was withdrawing his candidacy and offering his support to the frontrunner Paul Nuttall.

Speaking alongside his counterpart Boris Johnson, Germany’s foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier, said: “Brexit is the clear and unmistakable position of your government. We regret that but of course we respect this decision.” He added: “we should create the conditions as soon as possible for the negotiations to begin,” even if Britain’s Parliament does need a say. “A stalemate won’t do either side any good,” he added.

Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, has been poised to seek formal representation in the action if Holyrood’s ability to give legislative consent to the final Brexit deal becomes part of the legal arguments in next month’s hearing. She told the Scottish parliament yesterday she would actively consider joining the case: “The job of this government is to protect Scotland’s interests; Scotland voted to remain in the EU and my job is therefore to protect our place in Europe and the single market as far as I possibly can.” This is a contentious area: Theresa May’s UK government argues that leaving the EU is wholly reserved to Westminster as it deals with foreign affairs and treaties. Scottish and now Welsh ministers argue that their devolved powers are directly affected by leaving the EU. Sturgeon has stopped short of stating Holyrood will try to block Brexit by withholding legislative consent but insists that Scotland’s specific interests are intimately wrapped up in the Brexit deal. Her officials admit that legislative consent is a convention, not a legal right. Scottish government lawyers have already been sitting in on the high court hearings as observers in case that became an issue. Scottish sources said the statement on Friday by Mick Antoniw, the counsel general for Wales, now made a live prospect. Antoniw said the article 50 hearing “raise[s] issues of profound importance not only in relation to the concept of Parliamentary Sovereignty but also in relation to the wider constitutional arrangements of the United Kingdom and the legal framework for devolution.” Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.20am EDT 10:20 Rajeev Syal A friend of Phillips said he has resigned because the Conservatives have become “Ukip lite”, writes Rajeev Syal. “It’s about values. The values of this government are not his values. “They’ve lurched to the right and become UKIP lite. He is not,” the friend said. “Their failure to honour their promises on child refugees; the decimation of international aid to the poorest and most vulnerable in the world” are two of the key issues, the friend said. “Brexit is part of it, because they think they can do what the hell they like without asking parliament. But it’s only a small part of it. It’s the fact that he is not a Conservative in this mould,” the friend added.

Chantal-Aimée Doerries chairman of the Bar Council said: “If we do not respect the independent judiciary we put at risk our democracy. All the parties in the case accepted that it was right that the judges should determine this issue.” Speaking to BBC News she said: “What concerns me about the headlines is the attack on judges and the attack effectively on their role, in other words not recognising that they are independent in upholding the rule of law, not simply expressing their own views.” A selection of the front pages of British newspapers taken on November 4, 2016 following the High Court ruling yesterday that the Conservative government do not have the power on their own to trigger Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.31am EDT 09:31 Steven Morris Steven Morris has more on the response of the Welsh government to the high court ruling and subsequent challenge (see earlier). The first reaction of the Welsh first minister, Carwyn Jones, to the Brexit high court judgement was to urge the UK government not to challenge the ruling. It was not that he thought the ruling could scupper Brexit – which he opposed. Jones said there was no doubt in his mind that the UK would leave the EU. But he argued that debating the terms of Brexit in parliament would help the people of the whole of the UK to understand the strategy of Theresa May’s government. He also repeated – for the umpteenth time since the referendum – that votes should take place in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland to endorse the UK government’s position. But it was inevitable that there would be a supreme court hearing. Having considered overnight, the counsel general for Wales, Mick Antoniw, the government’s law officer, has said he wishes to attend that hearing – and address the judges. Antoniw, an assembly member for Pontypridd, is concerned at how the UK government had hoped to use prerogative powers to trigger article 50 without consulting MPs and peers – and believes this could have “profound” implications for the relationship between Westminster and the devolved assemblies. A fear is that future use of those powers may undermine the status of the Welsh assembly and the fundamental legal and constitutional relationships of the Welsh government to the UK government. There has been some concern that Wales will find it hard to get its voice heard during the build-up to Brexit. Antoniw’s appearance at the supreme court, if it is allowed, will help build Wales’ profile. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 9.23am EDT 09:23 The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, has urged Europe to ignore “sturm und drang” (storm and stress) in parliament over the high court ruling. Asked about Phillips’ resignation during at a press conference in Berlin with his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Johnson said: He should really not read too much into the legal decision that you have just seen or indeed the sturm und drang, if that’s the word I want, that is going on in parliament at the moment. The direction is very clear the will of the British people was expressed very clearly and it is the decision of Theresa May and her government to get on and make that process work. And that is what is going to happen. It is very important for our European friends and partners ... to get on with delivering a solution that works for both our great economies. Johnson also insisted that the ruling would not interfere with the timetable for triggering article 50.

Seven in eight devices are now Android. The global market share enjoyed by Android has hit new heights, with 87.5pc of all smartphones now using the operating system – up from 84pc last year. Apple’s iOS is down 3.5m units, from 13.6pc to 12.1pc. Emphatic. A “lacklustre” performance in China and Africa has cost Apple in the past 12 months as, despite the smartphone market still growing, it saw its device numbers and market share drop. Dominant force Android saw its position underlined on the back of several impressive devices released in recent months, with the trend set to continue following Google’s issue of the new Pixel smartphone. Indeed, Pixel’s popularity is such that Google can’t keep up with demand. “We’re thrilled to see the excitement for our new Pixel phones, and frankly, pre-order demand has exceeded our expectations,” said the company after customers complained of delays. “We’re working to restock our inventory as soon as possible.” That was only last month, so it had little impact on the market figures, provided by Strategy Analytics, with the crowded Android market showing no signs of saturation just yet. During the summer, Google revealed plans to train up to 2m software developers in India on its mobile platform. This came two months after Apple announced 4,000 new jobs in Hyderabad, and also established a new iOS apps development centre in Bengaluru to accelerate the Indian tech start-up ecosystem. Calling Android’s market share lead “unassailable”, Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics, said the low-cost alternative to iOS is too appealing to developers and manufacturers. “However, several challenges remain for Google,” he added. “The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google’s new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.” Android 7 is gradually coming on stream over the next few months, with several devices loosely divulging their adoption rates so far. Huawei’s Mate 9 was the first of many, revealed earlier this week. The other operating systems, like Microsoft Windows Phone and BlackBerry, now make up just 0.3pc of the market. Android growth continues.

By Sarmistha Acharya November 4, 2016 08:12 GMT Google rejects antitrust charges by the European Union Reuters Google on Thursday (3 November) rejected the European Union's antitrust charges of displaying its own shopping service and blocking rivals in online search adverts. Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, said the accusations had no factual, legal, or economic basis and the company's actions were driven by users, says a Reuters report. "We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers," Walker said. He said the European Commission did not consider competition from Amazon, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by Facebook and Pinterest. The EU said it has received Google's response and would consider it. In an email to Reuters, Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said, "In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation." Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School, said it might be difficult for Google to convince the regulators based on its latest argument. "Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point," said Carrier. Google also rejected a proposal of the Commission that would allow the company to charge rivals for displaying their services prominently. The company said it had scrapped exclusivity clauses and provisions identified as anti-competitive. The Commission is planning to charge a hefty fine from Google if it is found guilty of breaching EU rules. According to a 150-page complaint that Google received from the EU, the company could face a large fine for its anti-competitive practices. "The Commission intends to set the fine at a level which will be sufficient to ensure deterrence," the document reads. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion (£5.9bn) or 10% of Google's global turnover for each case. The European Commission launched an investigation against Google following complaints raised by rivals such as Microsoft, other European and US firms six years ago. In April 2015, the regulators followed up with the anti-competitive charges. In July this year Google faced a fresh set of complaints from the EU over its ads business. The internet search giant is accused of abusing its dominant position by allegedly restricting rival third-party websites from displaying search ads. The Commission sent two statements of objections to Google and its parent company Alphabet.

Let's hear it for data over audio Kotkin: Why Trump won Google has sought to blunt the European Commission’s three-prong inquiry into its business practices – by claiming the Eurocrats don’t understand antitrust law. Writing on Google’s corporate blog, senior VP and general counsel Kent Walker disclosed that Google has responded to the Commission’s shopping and advertising concerns, and will soon file its response to the Android portion. Walker says the historic shopping investigation – that’s the one Commissioner Almunia tried to settle mutually but couldn’t – failed to take into account the market power of Amazon. Google had introduced its own comparison shopping engine “Shopping,” demoting rivals. The EU had argued that Amazon couldn’t be considered a rival, because it sometimes paid shopping comparison sites for referral traffic. “All of these services – search engines, price comparison sites, merchant platforms, and merchants – compete with each other in online shopping. That’s why online shopping is so dynamic and has grown so much in recent years,” Walker writes. Amazon has some element of price comparison, but comparison sites like uSwitch, PriceRunner and Kelkoo come readily to mind as rivals to Google’s Shopping. Competition Commissioner Vestager declined to accept the settlement her predecessor Almunia had tried to thrash out with Google, which would have forestalled a formal Statement of Objections, and she pressed ahead in April 2015. (Here’s why.) Twelve months later, Vestager opened up a new front, saying Google used its Android platform to exclude rivals in maps and search, via its contracts with phone makers. The phone makers were so reluctant to answer the Commission’s queries about Android that investigators had to threaten them with fines if they didn’t talk. FairSearch represents vertical search rivals shafted by Google. In a statement, FairSearch counsel Thomas Vinje says: We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers. When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money. Vinje noted that the anti-consumer actions by Google are so serious that the umbrella consumer organization for Europe, BEUC, filed a complaint against it with the European Commission – the first anti-trust complaint they ever filed. Last week FairSearch noted, tartly, that: “Google may actually believe it's a force for good in the world.  Most monopolists believe this about themselves. They believe everyone is better off by virtue of what they perceive as the benevolent use of their vast power.” Vinje added, “Google is more powerful than Microsoft ever was. It occupies a more central position in the economy and in people’s lives, and the exercises of its vast power cause more harm than Microsoft’s did.” Vertical search pioneer Foundem – which split from iCOMP last year – pointed out that: “[Google’s] protestations about the flourishing fortunes of Amazon and eBay remain the red herrings they have always been. Google does not (yet) have an eCommerce, auction, or merchant-platform service that competes with Amazon or eBay. Therefore, Google does not (yet) have any incentive to anti-competitively penalise Amazon or eBay in its natural search results, and it does not (yet) have any competing service of its own to anti-competitively favour.” ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 47 Comments More from The Register Getty Images flings competition sueball at Google Image Search If you can see it in search, you won't buy it, says image bank 50 Comments Blighty competition watchdog pokes pointy finger into cloud storage CMA probing whether price and service changes breach consumer law 11 Comments Qualcomm huffs and puffs at Korean competition probe Chip vendor snaps back: 'Device level licensing is worldwide industry norm' 2 Comments 'Dominant' Facebook hauled over coals by German competition authority Firm said to have broken data protection rules 19 Comments EU’s digi VP: More telco consolidation!

Home Industry Companies Google-parent Alphabet reveals hardware inventory numbers for the first time Google-parent Alphabet reveals hardware inventory numbers for the first time Google unveiled the first suite of hardware products it designed and made itself last month. Now its parent company is giving investors a first sign that this isn’t just a passing fad. By: Bloomberg | Published: November 4, 2016 12:57 PM The new numbers cover assets for all of Alphabet, so they include inventory of gadgets from the Nest unit, which sells internet-connected devices like thermostats. (Reuters) Google unveiled the first suite of hardware products it designed and made itself last month. Now its parent company is giving investors a first sign that this isn’t just a passing fad. Alphabet Inc. reported a new inventory line in its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The holding company disclosed inventory of $559 million on its balance sheet at the end of September, reflecting the growing pile of hardware the company is trying to sell, such as its new Pixel phone that competes with Apple Inc.’s iPhone. The new numbers cover assets for all of Alphabet, so they include inventory of gadgets from the Nest unit, which sells internet-connected devices like thermostats. Alphabet reported Thursday that its inventory was $491 million at the end of 2015, likely reflecting Nest hardware. An Alphabet spokeswoman declined to comment on the filing. Previously, inventory was included in a catchall “other assets” line item in the company’s financial reports. Google has sold hardware for several years, including its Nexus smartphones, but they were negligible efforts and hardware partners were responsible for most of the design and manufacturing, and assumed a lot of the inventory risk. “Part of being the seller of record means that inventory, that supply chain risk — you know, hundreds of millions of dollars on the line on any given day — that’s on Google now,” Jason Bremner, a former Qualcomm executive who works on Google’s new hardware supply chain, said in a recent interview. “Typically, that risk was on our OEM partners.” The software giant is now selling a quartet of new home-grown consumer devices: its Pixel phone, a virtual-reality headset, a wireless router system and a voice-activated speaker called Google Home. Some analysts have expressed concern that Google’s new hardware efforts will dampen the company’s margins, particularly after considerable marketing spending. “While Google has priced many of the new devices competitively with others that exist today, we view go-to-market as a clear hurdle to wide acceptance, which will require investments in brand, marketing and distribution to overcome,” UBS analyst Eric Sheridan wrote in a note to investors last month. While Alphabet is revealing some financial details of its hardware program, it’s still keeping most under wraps. The company doesn’t break out gadget sales, for instance.

Google said Thursday that the EU's allegations lack evidence and would ultimately harm users in favor "of a small number of websites," in a blog posting detailing its response to European Commission antitrust objections over its comparison-shopping and AdSense services. "The commission's revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online," Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel said in the blog post. The EU's "claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics." VIDEOS TOP JOBS Google faced four EU antitrust complaints since the Brussels-based regulator opened its first probe into the Mountain View, Calif.-based company in November 2010. In a previous response, Google ridiculed as "peculiar and problematic" a first statement of objections over the way it displays search results. The commission refined its shopping case in July, saying it has "a broad range of additional evidence and data" that the Alphabet Inc. unit systematically favors its own comparison-shopping service in its search results and that smaller rivals lose traffic when they appear lower down in results. "There is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites," Walker said in the blog. The Brussels-based commission said it received Google's responses and will "carefully consider" them "before taking any decision on how to proceed." Anti-Google campaigners criticized the company's response. "When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money," said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer with Clifford Chance who represents FairSearch Europe, whose members include Expedia and Nokia. The extra statement of objections in the shopping case "didn't offer a new theory, but argued that because sites like Amazon sometimes pay" price comparison aggregators "for referred traffic, they can't also be considered rivals," said Walker. Google's view is that Amazon only gets a small amount of its traffic from such services, "hardly enough to support the idea they don't compete with price comparison sites," he said. "The data show that the handful of price comparison sites who've filed competition complaints don't reflect the wider marketplace," said Walker. Over the past 10 years "a rapidly increasing amount of traffic flowed from our search pages to popular sites like Amazon and eBay as they expanded in Europe, hardly a sign of our 'favoring' our own ads." Walker said Google also sent its response to a separate EU complaint accusing the company of obstructing competition for online ads with its AdSense for Search product, which places advertising on websites, including retailers, telecommunications operators and newspapers. Google has until Nov. 11 to respond to a third charge sheet the EU sent it in April over its Android smartphone software. The company will respond to the Android antitrust complaint "in the days to come," said Walker. While all these cases are separate, each time they "cite just a few complaints to justify broad legal claims."   Share This Article JOIN THE DISCUSSION     Post a Comment POPULAR STORIES LDS Church 'retires' Mormon apostle's 'little factory' pamphlet Critics cringe at Trump strategist Bannon's ties to alt-right, rhetoric targeting Mormons Democrat Elijah Cummings presses Jason Chaffetz to investigate Donald Trump's finances Utah football: Oregon is struggling, but Utes still see a dangerous team (with video) Jazz update: Hood, Hill, Favors, Diaw questionable vs. Memphis ELEVATE Life is a Peach at the SALT Awards   Salt Lake Regional Medical Center First in the U.S. to Perform Meniscus Replacement   From Wall St to Hawaii to Utah Valley: UVU Professor Cary Wasden Mentors MBA Finance Students   Contests and Promotions COMMENTS POST A COMMENT      () News All Local News Search Last 36 hours Nation + World RSS Twitter Environment Politics Justice Polygamy Education Weather Utah's Right Elevate Empower Utah Cool Stuff The Legacy of Joe Hill I Love videos Whatever Happened To...

Sadly, magic isn’t real, and no parent in their right mind would send their kid to a school with a Basilisk infestation problem. That said, Google’s got the next best thing. It just updated the Google app with some magical incantations. TNW Answers Your questions answered by founders, experts and thought leaders in business, design and tech. Join a chat Now, when you say “OK Google, lumos,” it’ll switch on your flashlight. To turn it off, the magic word is “nox.” To turn off your phone’s ringer and notifications, try “Silencio.”   The update is here to coincide with the launch of “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them”. The long-awaited spin-off of Harry Potter follows the adventures of “magizoologist” Newt Scamander in 1920’s New York, and is due to be released in cinemas later this month. Google has also updated Google Street View to include locations from the film. Now, fans can visit landmarks from the film, like the headquarters of the MACUSA (Magical Congress of the USA), the Steen National Bank, and the underground speakeasy The Blind Pig. And when Google releases its Daydream View headset in November, it’ll come with an experience that lets you delve into Newt Scamander’s magical suitcase, find escaped magical beasts, and stop them from destroying New York City. The icing on the cake (or rather, foam on the butterbeer) is an exclusive Fantastic Beasts sticker pack, which will arrive in Google Allo shortly.

Home Industry Tech Google captures smartphone market as 9 out of 10 devices use Android: Report Google captures smartphone market as 9 out of 10 devices use Android: Report With the decline of Apple's iOS, global tech giant Google with its Android OS is said to have a record market share in Quarter 3 this year. By: FE Online | Published: November 4, 2016 11:17 AM According to a research, the operating system has grabbed 87.5 % of the smartphone market all over the world, in the three months till September 2016. With the decline of Apple’s iOS, global tech giant Google with its Android OS is said to have a record market share in Quarter 3 this year. According to a research, the operating system has grabbed 87.5 % of the smartphone market all over the world, in the three months till September 2016. The analytical research was posted by Strategy Analytics. According to the research total number of Android smartphone shipments globally were more than 328 million devices out of a total smartphone shipment of 375 million units, in the third quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, Apple iOS managed only a little over 45 million units. Android grew by 10.3 percent since last year Q3, while iOS went down by 5.2 percent. This result for Apple was also evident in Apple’s latest earnings results, where it said that there was a continuous decline in iPhone sales for the third quarter. According to their results, Apple iOS market share was 12.1 percent in Q3, down from 13.6 percent in 2015. Meanwhile, other operating systems like Windows, Blackberry and Samsung’s Tizen have had negligible sales, as together they amounted to only 0.3 percent of the market, which is 1.3 million units shipments. This result is down by a huge 84 percent year-to-year. The reason for Android sales being higher every year is also because of low-cost smartphones being made in China. At the moment the lead is very big and Google can enjoy it for a moment, but according to the research, it will have tough challenges ahead. Woody Oh, director at Strategy Analytics said, “Android’s leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide. Woody added, “However, several challenges remain for Google. The Android platform is getting overcrowded with hundreds of manufacturers, few Android device vendors make profits, and Google’s new Pixel range is attacking its own hardware partners that made Android popular in the first place.” Also read | Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Feature to feature, how the two flagships match up Google, in October, released its latest offerings, Google Pixel and Pixel XL, which made a lot of smartphone makers which run Android, angry. Since the report is until September, when Apple just released its new iPhone 7 and 7Plus, their records are to get better as well. Please Wait while comments are loading...

Google filed objections against beefed up charges made by hard-charging European Commission competition chief Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, said in a blog that the shopping case “still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online.” “We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,” Walker said. The EU now has three cases on the go against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager in a campaign that has raised hackles on the other side of the Atlantic. The biggest and most recent case involves Google’s Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company’s most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs. Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week. The second and oldest case involves Google’s alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged in 2015, and then this July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding. Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party websites. That case concerns Google’s AdSense service where websites can install a customised search engine on their site which generates revenue from having relevant ads appear on the search results page. The European Commission, confirming it had received the response to the shopping and Adsense cases, said it “will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.” The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably. Instead, the cases have raised tensions between the Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald’s. The European Commission, which polices EU competition policy, launched an initial investigation into Google in 2010 following complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and Trip Advisor that it favoured its own services when customers ran searches. “We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers,” said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case. Vestager’s predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. Since that time, attitudes in Europe towards Google have deteriorated after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Silicon Valley giants had provided troves of personal data to US intelligence.

Define your site main menu Escaping The Walled Gardens In The Clouds After going through a bunch of OS X Mountain Lion reviews I have to say I can’t wait to get it onto my Mac. For the most part the devil’s in the details; all the little things that accrue to form what I expect to be a better user experience. Besides all of the little things, however, there is something that increasingly defines what OS X is about: the iCloud. As Tim Cook said, Apple doubled down on iCloud with Mountain Lion, and it shows. Using Mountain Lion it will be hard to avoid it. TextEdit’s save dialog, for instance, offers iCloud document storage by default, a practice to be followed by other Apple applications and encouraged for third party apps as well. Then there are the Reminders, Notes, and Game Center, and a significant portion of their value is the fact that they seamlessly sync with their equivalents on the iPhone and the iPad. When we look at the trend of iCloud integration with OSX and iOS we could almost, similarly to what John Siracusa remarked, consider OSX and iOS as just clients to the iCloud. It’s beginning to feel like it is all just one big iCloud OS for the entire Apple world. But that’s just the thing that’s bothering me a little. It is the Apple world; it’s an exclusive club. I have a MacBook Pro, and that’s the only Apple device I own. I own an Android smartphone and a Windows PC. In this configuration much of the benefit of the iCloud fades away from me. The Notes app becomes just another notes app, since it’s super-seamless syncing with its iOS equivalent means nothing to me. Why can’t it sync to a compatible Android equivalent? Well, of course, I might as well ask why won’t pigs fly wearing icy necklaces in hell! It’s slightly entertaining to read John Siracusa espouse the greatness of the iCloud and how it makes life easier for its users, and seem so oblivious to the possibility that some Apple users might only own a Mac. It is as if he just assumes that everyone reading owns at least a Mac and an iPhone. This is all the more interesting when you consider the fact that his audience are supposed to be nerds; people who are far more likely to own Android phones at the same time as a Mac. People, you know, a little bit like me. But this is all just an introduction. Apple represents the best example of this “ecosystem-ism”, a trend that seems especially enabled by cloud computing. Everything is absolutely awesome so long as you don’t step out of the ecosystem, and when you look at their marketing they act as if nothing else in the world exists but their ecosystem. Their ecosystem is their entire reality. Of course you’ll have an iPhone! Why, you might even have an iPad! Isn’t it all just so obvious? It’s iCloud magic baby! You have to be all-in! But I’m not. I have a Mac, and an Android phone. I’m not all in, and that makes me feel like a black sheep in this vision of theirs. It makes me feel as if I should either just exit the entire Apple world, or go all in, drop my Android and buy an iPhone, and then an iPad, and then an Apple TV (hey, AirPlay mirroring!), and so on. Apple may be the best example of this game at play, but they’re far from the only ones. The other two big players, Google and Microsoft, are guilty of it as well. Google has its own little island. Actually, it’s not little, and it’s not an island. It’s more like an omnipresent matrix of nodes that are becoming ever more tightly knotted with each other as they squeeze the entire planet out of its advertising dollars. But seriously, if you look at the video of a simple little Google service like Google Tasks you will keep hearing and seeing about Google this and Google that. It integrates with Gmail, and Google Calendar, and Google Docs. It’s so great! Unless, perhaps, you kinda want to use your own calendar application, and just perhaps prefer Yahoo Mail or something. Will Tasks integrate with those? Probably not. Yet again we are pressed into a situation where everything is just so awesome, smooth and easy so long as you stick with their predefined paradigm. No mixing and matching for you. What about Microsoft? Well, it is easy to imagine a similarly tight integration between Windows 8 and Windows Phone, as well as the whole existing Windows Live and Xbox Live ecosystem. As Microsoft gets better at presenting this as a single coherent whole, much like Apple does (and that’s where I think they want to be heading), we’ll have a similar situation as with Apple and Google. So, it’s a world of silos, and if you expect the smoothest experience possible it seems you’re no longer choosing between specific operating systems or specific devices. You are choosing between entire frigging companies! Either you go all in with Apple, or all in with Google, or all in with Microsoft. Take your pick. If you, however, choose to mix and match between them then you have to concede to a possibly suboptimal, perhaps messier, user experience. And then you have to fight off the constant barrage of marketing speak that keeps trying to bring you in line with the ecosystem of the platform you are primarily using. It gives me the feeling as if I am somehow underutilizing OS X by not taking full advantage of the iCloud because I haven’t fully bought into the Apple’s ecosystem. Mixing and Matching Now, it’s really not so bad, and I’m not trying to paint this as some kind of a disaster. There are plenty of third party solutions out there which work pretty smoothly by themselves, and independently of the major ecosystems. For instance we have Simplenote, a cloud based note taking service which is compatible with a whole bunch of different note taking apps across all platforms. I am using Notational Velocity on my Mac, and Notational Acceleration on my Android. Both hook up to the Simplenote cloud for instant iCloud-like syncing of all notes I make on either the Mac or the Android. This makes me independent of all the big ecosystems for my note taking. It makes me feel like I have my own little ecosystem. Of course, the experience still isn’t as slick as the one with Apple Notes, at least with the Android app (and others are actually worse), so I guess I can count that as a penalty for daring to stray into the dirty world of third parties. Open Cross-Platform Universal Clouds However, this example does lead to an interesting idea. What if we had the smooth user experience of the big closed ecosystems, but independent of the big closed ecosystems? In such a scenario we have open clouds which developers can hook into for all the data piping necessary, and users can register and login with to store their data on, using any compatible application. Let’s call one such cloud OpenCloud. You would have an OpenCloud ID (much like the Apple ID), and could choose between multitude of OpenCloud compatible photo apps (for example) on any platform. You choose one on your Android phone, one on Windows PC, and one on the iPad. Input your OpenCloud login into all of them and your photos between all of these apps on all of these devices get synced much in the same manner as iCloud does between iPhoto on iPad and Mac. So yes, you take a picture on your Android phone and voila it appears on your Windows PC, and your iPad immediately, thanks to the magic of the OpenCloud. Similarly, if you add a picture to the app on your iPad, it automatically appears on Windows and Android equivalents. If you change the application on any of these devices to another OpenCloud compatible device it could either migrate the data from the old app or just interface with the data stored on the OpenCloud, taking over where the previous app left off. The big difference between this and the iCloud (or Google and Microsoft’s ecosystems), of course, is that it all just works across all platforms instead of just within the confines of a single ecosystem. You can mix and match applications, devices, and operating systems at your hearts content, essentially creating your own ecosystem. We could go even further and imagine multiple different open clouds all following a certain set of standards that allows them to sync between each other. They would compete in their performance, storage pricing etc. If you decide to use a different universal open cloud service there would be an easy way to migrate your data, and happily continue on with the new cloud. Such a cloud might be a kind of blend between what already exists. Simperium and Dropbox come to mind whereas Simperium offers a developer-facing piece of the puzzle (data piping magic), and Dropbox offers a user friendly storage box and data syncing. As John Siracusa explained in his OSX Mountain Lion mega-review, iCloud itself actually consists of three separate parts handling various aspects necessary for the whole thing to work the way it does. Sometimes it seems as if everything in the tech world is getting closed up into walled gardens, but I tend to think things are a little less simplistic. Just as it seems things are getting too closed and consolidated this creates impetus for the creation of alternative paradigms that would bring back the balance. While it may seem as if we are being pushed between huge walled gardens, there is little reason why alternatives outside of those walls cannot be created, which provide the same smooth user experience. The components and beginnings of it are already out there, like Simperium and Dropbox. It doesn’t seem like this dream is so far fetched.   Follow Us!

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google Play Store to now offer introductory prices for subscription apps Google announced new features for Google Play Store developers at its Playtime developer event in San Francisco. The new features are focused on its subscription business. Developers will now be able to offer introductory promotional pricing for subscription apps for a set period of time. For example, you can offer a subscription for $1 per month for the first three months before the normal subscription price kicks in. The introductory pricing will help developers acquire more subscribers and grow subscription business. The latest move from Google is a welcome move as users can try the app or service at a discounted price before paying full amount for it. Google said subscriptions are the fastest growing business model on Play and consumer spending in subscription apps is increasing 10 times over the last 3 years. The company has also announced other features such as preregistration, feedback early with Early Acces, beta testing feature and more. Earlier this month, Google announced improvements to spam detection and fraud system for Play Store installs and app reviews.

There was no phone signal, and the electricity only comes on for a few hours in the evening. The people there are farmers, so they wake up early. They work all day, and then in the evening they eat dinner before dark. And then they go to sleep. There’s nothing else to do.” But the typical agricultural setting of Harisal was about to change. Kumar, the network head of a rural internet provider AirJaldi had come to transform it into India’s first digital village, under a scheme backed by the Indian government and software giant Microsoft. “We set up a Wi-Fi tower and three smaller hotspots. At first, people were struggling to get online, they didn’t know how to sign on, and we had to teach them. Now, when I visit the village, the kids come to us and teach us how to get the internet working.” About 2,000 villagers live in Harisal. There are only five or six laptops in the village, but almost every household has a smartphone. For them, the new Wi-Fi connection changed their lives overnight. “We finally feel connected to the rest of the world,” says Jagdishkumar Someshwar Sirsat, the headmaster of the village school. “It’s made small tasks easier. For example, we had to give attendance records to the state government. Before, someone would have to hand deliver those to the government office in the city. Now, we can just fill out a form online, and its done,” he says.

Now that they have internet, they can go online and look up whatever they’re interested in. For the older kids, we’re using online tutorials on YouTube and educational video blogs to teach them new things. They love it.” Sheetal Thorat, a doctor in Harisal, says internet connections could save lives. “In the village, there are no specialists for the heart or brain. There’s just me and two other field doctors for the whole village, and we’re general practitioners. Now that we have Wi-Fi, we can set up consultations with heart or brain specialists in Mumbai, and then they can send back reports online.” Microsoft funded the project, and plans to get 50 more villages around Harisal online. Bhaskar Pramanik, chairman of Microsoft India, says its project to get villages online is philanthropic. “We don’t have any commercial interest in these projects. We want telecom and other service providers to use the connectivity to provide citizens with useful services,” he says. Microsoft has also previously said it would be good for its own business if more people were online. Google and Facebook join online push Microsoft is not alone in the race to get India online. Google has launched a scheme to provide free public Wi-Fi at 100 railway stations. About 3.5m users have already connected to Google’s station Wi-Fi service, with an estimated 15,000 people coming online for the first time every day thanks to the scheme. “We want to expand to new venues, like cafes and malls, to help more people get online, and we’re looking for strategic and forwarding-thinking partners to work with on this effort,” says Caeser Sengupta, vice-president of Google’s “Next Billion Users” team. Last year, Facebook tried to launch Free Basics, which would have allowed people in rural India free access to websites chosen by the company, but the plan was blocked after millions wrote to the telecoms authority saying the scheme would give Facebook too much power. Now, the company has come up with a new scheme, Express Wi-Fi, which will allow those in rural India to buy fast, cheap and reliable mobile data packs. India’s rapidly developing economy, and increasing smartphone penetration presents a huge opportunity for tech firms, who are looking for new markets to expand their products and services, as growth in western economies slows. According to the World Bank’s latest figures, 26% of India’s 1.25 billion population has internet access. In 2014–15, 60 million, equivalent to the entire UK population, went online for the first time. About 900 million people in India, mostly in rural areas, are offline. 'Poor internet for poor people': India's activists fight Facebook connection plan Read more “India is the only major economy in the world that had a year-on-year growth in internet and smartphone users,” says Vikas Kothari, tech analyst at venture capital firm Lightbox. “Large players like Google, Facebook and Microsoft are looking for their next set of billion users and India looks the most promising.” Internet access could transform economy Facebook has not yet released details of how much profit it expects to make from its Express Wi-Fi service, or how much investment will be needed to subsidise rural data access, but the company says that internet access will benefit everybody. “Internet access means opportunity. It enables progress. It improves knowledge, economies, lives and communities,” says a Facebook spokesperson. The tech companies may appear benevolent, but Kothari says they will all benefit if India’s internet accessibility increases. “In a [digital] ecosystem when infrastructure improves, the biggest beneficiaries are the large players,” he explains. Kothari says the tech giants see India as a long-term investment. “The most visited sites or apps in India are Google Search, Play Store, YouTube, WhatsApp and Facebook. Google and Facebook’s business models don’t depend on a fee, but on user data. If more people use their products, the more data they get, thus increasing their ad revenues.” For India, better internet infrastructure could transform the economy, and the lives of ordinary citizens. “Improved connectivity will further democratise access to education, healthcare and financial services. People in remote areas will get access to skill-development courses, tertiary telemedicine and reports on agriculture and commodity prices, thus improving their lives,” says Kothari.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Tuesday November 15, 2016 Life & Style Health Larger / SmallerNight Mode How the 'worried well' are making themselves sick Rania Spooner 4 Nov 2016, 1:58 p.m. This is why you need to dump Doctor Google. How the 'worried well' are making themselves sick The researchers believe obsessively monitoring our symptoms could be doing more harm than good. Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit This is why you need to dump Doctor Google. Worrying about your symptoms could make you sick. Health-related anxiety potentially increases your odds of a heart attack or angina by about 70 per cent, according to a European study published in the British medical journal BMJ Open today. From a study of more than 7000 people, 6 per cent of those who needlessly stressed about getting sick, known as "the worried well," went on to develop ischemic heart disease within 10 years compared with 3 per cent of their carefree counterparts. When the researchers adjusted out known risk factors for heart disease such as smoking and lack of exercise, the worried well had an even larger increased risk compared with the unworried. And the more intense a person's fear of getting sick was, the greater their chances of developing heart illness became. "If persons with high levels of health anxiety stay alert with the intention to better 'control' and 'detect' early signs of severe somatic diseases, it might contribute to unintentional harmful effects as the autonomous activation associated with anxiety in general likely is associated with increased risk of IHD," the author's wrote. "At best, this finding might encourage patients to seek treatment for health anxiety and to trust their heart." Their research used the Hordaland Health Study (HUSK), which followed 7052 Norwegians for 12 years from 1997, and the Cardiovascular Diseases in Norway Project, which collected data on heart disease deaths and hospitalisations from 1994-2009. People were ranked on their health anxiety levels using the Whitely test, which requires participants to give a score of 1 to 5 on how much they relate to each of 14 statements. Questions include  "Do you think there is something seriously wrong with your body?" and "If you feel ill and someone tells you that you are looking better, do you become annoyed?" An overall score of more than 31 out of a possible 55 meant a participant had health anxiety. The researchers – led by Dr Line Iden Berge, from the Sandviken University Hospital in Bergen, Norway – also found the worried well said they exercised less often and were more likely to smoke. They wrote that no firm conclusions about cause and effect could be drawn from their study and warned that health anxiety often sat alongside other mental health issues. Cardiologist David Colquhoun, chair of the clinical council of the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand, said there were known psycho-social risk factors that were as important at predicting heart attack as cholesterol and blood pressure levels. He was part of a Heart Foundation expert committee that found depression and social isolation were independent predictors of heart attack; and said many people who experienced depression often also had anxiety. "It may be that if you're obsessively worried about your health this is a marker of you being anxious about other things and this confirms previous data that it increases your personal risk of having a heart attack," Professor Colquhoun said. "Perceived stress, whether its marital, work or financial, is a powerful predictor of heart attack." Extreme anxiety could cause a heart attack because the body was flooded with adrenaline, which drives the heart rate up and can cause a blood clot in the artery. "Being constantly on alert appears to stimulate growth of the cholesterol plaque in the artery and then severe stress can trigger rupturing of the plaque," he said. Professor Colquhoun said people with high risk factors like a family history of heart attack should be keeping an eye on their symptoms, and worry is quite rational in some circumstances. Hypochondriasis, also called hypochondria, which describes abnormal chronic anxiety about one's health, was dropped from the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It was replaced with two new conditions: somatic symptom disorder – which refers to patients with one or more chronic bodily symptom about which they were excessively concerned; and illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety relates to patients who may or may not have a medical condition, have heightened bodily sensations and are anxious about the possibility of unknown illness, which they may obsessively research. Psychiatrist Steve Ellen, the director of psychosocial oncology at the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre in Melbourne, said once identified, health anxiety was very treatable but many people who experience it don't seek help from mental health practitioners. "The patients who believe they've got something wrong with them, who are phobic about illnesses, they don't come to shrinks, they go to physical doctors to get tests," he said. Associate Professor Ellen said every day the average person has about a dozen physical symptoms that are mostly dismissed. "But if you're phobic or anxious about your health you'll over interpret those symptoms," he said. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death in Australia, accounting for 19,777 deaths in 2015.

Android: Is Google Winning The Smartphone OS War? Technology 33 0 0 November 4, 2016 iOS Vs. Android: Is Google Winning The Smartphone OS War? Rahul Srinivas Is Google winning the smartphone OS war? Or has it already won the battle? This is the question in everyone’s minds after new research conducted by analytics firm Strategy Analytics revealed that Google’s popular smartphone OS is now found on close to 90 percent of all the smartphones being shipped globally. In a press release issued by Strategy Analytics, the firm revealed that its research had found that Google Android now runs on more than 87 percent of the smartphones that were shipped in the third quarter of 2016. The rest of the players in the smartphone OS space only account for the remaining 12 percent of the shipments. While most other smartphone operating systems have faded into oblivion, the only platform giving some competition to Android is Apple’s iOS. According to the latest data, iOS actually lost a couple of percentage points in the third quarter of 2016 when compared to the same period in Q3, 2015. iOS had a global market share of 13.6 percent in Q3 2015, which dipped to 12.1 percent in Q3, 2016. In the same period, Android managed to increase its dominance from having a market share of 84.1 percent in Q3 2015 to reaching 87.5 percent in Q3 2016. While Android shipments saw a 10.3 percent growth, iOS shipments dropped by 5.2 percent in the same time period. The growth of Android was also at the cost of other players who saw a decline of a staggering 84.1 percent in shipments in the past year. The only significant name in this segment is Windows Phone, which is now more or less dead. #android achieves record 87.5 percent of global smartphone shipments in Q3 2016 https://t.co/aLvZhQzCHm pic.twitter.com/nXVFl2lqTC — Android Authority (@AndroidAuth) November 3, 2016 According to Strategy Analytics, the global smartphone industry saw an overall growth in the third quarter of 2016 with shipments growing by 6 percent compared to the same period last year. Compared to the 354.2 million smartphone shipments in Q3, 2015, more than 375.4 million handsets were shipped in Q3, 2016 — most of these shipments being Android powered devices. Strategy Analytics went on to add that this was the fastest growth rate for a year recorded in recent times. Most of the new smartphone growth comes from markets in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, where smartphone penetration is still relatively lower and there is plenty of room for growth. While countries like India and China have slowed a down a bit, both still contribute heavily to help Android win the numbers game. Commenting on the latest smartphone operating system trends, Neil Mawston, Executive Director at Strategy Analytics, said the following. “Android’s domination of global smartphone shipments remained strong in Q3 2016, with a record 88 percent of all smartphones now running Google’s OS. Android’s gain came at the expense of every major rival platform. Apple iOS lost ground to Android and dipped to 12 percent share worldwide in Q3 2016, due to a lackluster performance in China and Africa. BlackBerry and Microsoft Windows Phone have all but disappeared due to strategic shifts, while Tizen and other emerging platforms softened as a result of limited product portfolios and modest developer support.” Woody Oh, Director at Strategy Analytics, added the following. “Android’s leadership of the global smartphone market looks unassailable at the moment. Its low-cost services and user-friendly software remain attractive to hardware makers, operators and consumers worldwide.” He was, however, of the opinion that even though things look great for Android, things are all not rosy. The Android platform is currently very cluttered and overcrowded. Also, very few Android vendors are actually making money. Add to it the fact that Google themselves have launched their own devices, which sort of puts them in conflict with its own hardware partners. Another interesting facet about iOS is the fact that even with less than 15 percent of the market, it still manages to match Android when it comes to contributing to global mobile internet traffic. With almost 15% of device shipments, iOS generates the same global internet traffic than Android phones (via @BenedictEvans ) pic.twitter.com/oL6U7tYKMC — Benoit Tabaka (@btabaka) November 2, 2016 While there is no denying the fact that the introduction of the Apple iPhone back in 2007 heralded a new era for smartphones, do you think it was Android and Google that has benefited more from the innovations that iOS first brought to the table?

By: Reuters | Updated: November 4, 2016 10:41 am Google’s rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and US rivals.(Source: AP) Google on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines.  The US technology giant’s rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and a host of European and US rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google’s general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company’s actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. “We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn’t ‘favouring’ – that’s listening to our customers,” Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook and Pinterest. Also read: Google Pixel XL review: The new Android flagship in the market The EU executive said it had received Google’s response. “In each case, we will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,” Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. “Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point,” he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company’s global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

Google said Thursday that the EU's allegations lack evidence and would ultimately harm users in favor "of a small number of websites," in a blog posting detailing its response to European Commission antitrust objections over its comparison-shopping and AdSense services. "The commission's revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online," Kent Walker, Google's senior vice president and general counsel said in the blog post. The EU's "claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics." (Also see: EU Wants Google to Stop Anti-Competitive Android Practices, Fine Expected)Google faced four EU antitrust complaints since the Brussels-based regulator opened its first probe into the Mountain View, California-based company in November 2010. In a previous response, Google ridiculed as "peculiar and problematic" a first statement of objections over the way it displays search results. The commission refined its shopping case in July, saying it has "a broad range of additional evidence and data" that the Alphabet Inc. unit systematically favors its own comparison-shopping service in its search results and that smaller rivals lose traffic when they appear lower down in results. "There is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites," Walker said in the blog. The Brussels-based commission said it received Google's responses and will "carefully consider" them "before taking any decision on how to proceed." Anti-Google campaigners criticized the company's response. "When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money," said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer with Clifford Chance who represents FairSearch Europe, whose members include Expedia and Nokia. The extra statement of objections in the shopping case "didn't offer a new theory, but argued that because sites like Amazon sometimes pay" price comparison aggregators "for referred traffic, they can't also be considered rivals," said Walker. Google's view is that Amazon only gets a small amount of its traffic from such services, "hardly enough to support the idea they don't compete with price comparison sites," he said. "The data show that the handful of price comparison sites who've filed competition complaints don't reflect the wider marketplace," said Walker. Over the past 10 years "a rapidly increasing amount of traffic flowed from our search pages to popular sites like Amazon and eBay as they expanded in Europe, hardly a sign of our 'favoring' our own ads." Walker said Google also sent its response to a separate EU complaint accusing the company of obstructing competition for online ads with its AdSense for Search product, which places advertising on websites, including retailers, telecommunications operators and newspapers. Google has until November 11 to respond to a third charge sheet the EU sent it in April over its Android smartphone software. The company will respond to the Android antitrust complaint "in the days to come," said Walker. While all these cases are separate, each time they "cite just a few complaints to justify broad legal claims." © 2016 Bloomberg L.P.

The European Commission had accused Google of using its dominant position to take business away from price comparison and price aggregating sites, based on complaints it had received from these sites. Google contends that the most dominant position is held by Amazon itself, which competes for traffic with price aggregation sites more than Google does. The counter argument was that as Amazon pays these sites for listings, it should not be considered as a competition. Google provided data to show that a staggering majority of users start shopping online by checking the prices on Amazon, irrespective of whether or not they end up making a purchase from the site. Google came in a second place for users looking for prices, and only a fraction of users opted to check price comparison sites. Google also alleges that most of the shopping activity is conducted through native apps on smartphones. Google claims that it has improved its search results to deliver ads with pictures and prices, a process that helps Google, its partnered advertisers as well as the end users. Google claims there is no relation between the evolution of its search engine, and the performance of price comparison sites.
