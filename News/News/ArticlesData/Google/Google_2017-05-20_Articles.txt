This is where experience comes into play, where more experienced developers will probably be better at coming up with code that is more efficient, so like we said, not all apps are created equal. Google knows this and this is also something they want to help improve, which is why Google now has a new way of informing developers if their apps just aren’t quite up to scratch. Basically what happens is that if an app is ranked in the bottom 25% when it comes to stability, battery efficiency, or rendering metrics, Google will notify the developer via the developer console. Google revealed six different metrics that they will use to determine if an app has been made poorly, which includes error messages such as “Application not responding error”, experiencing at least one crash, where it keeps a device awake for more than an hour, an app that wakes a device up more than 10 times an hour, apps that run slower than 60fps, and laggy frame rendering. Of course whether or not the developer chooses to respond to Google’s advice/suggestions is a different story, but back in February Google did state that how well an app performs will affects its promotability, meaning that poorly-made apps could be less visible than better-made ones, so that should be incentive enough for developers to improve on their work.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Google Home now streams TV content from many more services, including HBO Now and Hulu Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/17 11:53am PDTMay 17, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 29 Share on Facebook 36 Share on Twitter Total Shares78 Google Google Home News One of the most interesting new features introduced during the Google I/O keynote has to be the integration between Google Home and Chromecast. The intelligent assistant can now show visual responses to interactions you have with via any Chromecast connected TV. For a while now we've been able to play videos through our Chromecast via YouTube and Netflix, and now many more services are being added. You can now ask Google Home to play content from new partners such as HBO Now, Hulu, CBS All Access, CW, and many more. This also includes support for Google services such as Google Play Movies & TV plus new cloud DVR platform YouTube TV. If you know what you want to watch you can dive into any of those products using Google Home and have it play whatever you desire. It can also come in handy if you don't really know what you want to watch... During his segment in the keynote, Google's Vice President of Product Management and General Manager of Google Home (longest job title ever) demoed visual responses with the YouTube app as he asked: "what's on YouTube?" This brought up his own personal recommendations on his TV. He then asked it to show him his Watch Later list and then asked for a specific video from and it, which it the played. While this is a staged product demo it looked undoubtedly impressive, especially the and contextual element of the conversation. Next up, the feature was put to use with new YouTube Tv service, which offers live TV streaming as well cloud DVR functionality through which you can play saved episodes of your favorite programs. In typically meta Google fashion the example that was chosen to play was the episode of Modern Family in which Google Home makes a cameo. Very Clever. Check out the rest of our coverage from Google I/O's 2017 keynote for more exciting new announcements. Tags chromecast google home hbo now hulu io17 io2017 tv youtube subscribe ...

It's almost worth dropping HBO from my plan and getting HBO Now. Abhimanyu Seth Typo: unnecessary 'and' >> especially the and contextual element of the conversation. Mario E Hdez Honest question, is google home worth purchasing? My home isn't very smart although I do have a ring doorbell, and recently purchased philips hue for one room. I also own 2 chromecasts. I've been on the fence about it for a while since it's missing basic features but to those of you who have now had ample time to live with it what do you think? A neighbor is offering his for 100 bucks. JG I enjoy mine. Hands free voice searches are very continent. There are times when she isn't able to do seemingly simple tasks that can get annoying. Maybe the neighbor would let you borrow it for a few days to try it out first, see if it works. JG Just HBO Now? What about HBO Go? Berni Hargrove Is "now" an accurate term for HBO Now, and Hulu integration? It's Sunday now and not a peep about the added services being live for anyone.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars BOTS No ‘OK, Google’ on the iPhone? That’s a huge problem John Brandon@jmbrandonbb May 20, 2017 10:14 PM Above: Google Assistant logo Image Credit: Alphabet Voicebots are all over my house right now. I’m testing two different Alexa-powered speakers in my office. I use Cortana on a desktop, Siri on both my MacBook and an iPhone 7 Plus, Google Assistant on a Pixel smartphone and the Google Home speaker, and both the Google Assistant and Siri on my television (thanks to the NVIDIA Shield and the Apple TV). I’m literally talking to bots all day, asking about the weather, the NBA Playoffs, and even obscure questions about Austria (where a few family members live). I’m known to suddenly say “OK, Google” during family meals when someone asks a question or makes a random comment. (Turns out, the Beauty and the Beast fable was published way back in 1740 and good old old Tom Brady is the oldest quarterback in the NFL.) Sadly, now that the Assistant is available for iPhone, I’m going to have to change my approach. At a restaurant recently, I found out the hard way that the Assistant app doesn’t respond to ‘OK, Google’ requests. It works exactly like an app on the iPhone that is not directly tied into the OS. That is, you can only talk to the iPhone by saying “Hey, Siri” to start a conversation. That’s not surprising at all. Android needs a few differentiators these days, right VentureBeat editorial team? Yet, the reason it’s sad is that there isn’t any reason to ever use the Assistant on iOS. To do that, I’d have to pick up my phone. Or, to be honest, fish out my phone form my pocket. Then, I might have to type on my phone. The reality is that user interface dynamics have changed in 2017. I’m typing a lot less. After work, I rarely use apps at all anymore. I will use a laptop to type up documents and check email, but for most activities — asking questions, closing a garage door, starting a movie, setting a reminder — I usually talk to a voicebot from across the room. This is another reason chatbots are not as vital to my daily routine. I’m living in a world that science fiction predicted a long time ago, mostly on Star Trek. Here’s a good example. I’m leaving for a grad ceremony soon. If I had to find out when I should leave the house, I’d have to normally find my phone, start the Google Maps app, type in the address, retype the address because I spelled the street name wrong, do a search, then check the miles and get a time estimate. That’s not a Herculean tasks (try figuring it out with an actual map), but with a voicebot, I don’t have to even look up from my cereal bowl. I say: “OK, Google, how far is it to France Avenue in Bloomington” and get the answer within seconds — it’s 58 miles. Some voicebots will tell me about traffic. Alexa can tell me, rather proactively, about the hours of the facility and even give me the full address and phone number. With the Google Home speaker, I can then call that location. Yet, the minute I have to use an app and type something, it suddenly takes much longer — maybe 10 minutes total. Voicebots literally give us back more time in our day. ‘OK, Google’ doesn’t work that way on the iPhone, though. It means I’ll never use it. And, over the next months and years, it’s less likely I’ll use any apps. The Assistant may be nice to have, and I’ll likely use it on a plane or when I’m the passenger in a car, but it’s mostly just a secondary option. Or, most likely, not an option at all.

First the NRL, where the video ref has had a fair work out by the looks, ruling one Roosters try in and another out. They jump out to a 20-6 lead at the half though, Mitchell Pearce orchestrating a third crossing before the interval. Plenty of chat that he should be the NSW starting half-back for Origin. Sticking in Sydney at the Football Stadium (proper ground names forever, commercial tags never) Israel Forlau is put through for a try just on the cusp of half time, giving the Waratahs a 24-11 lead over the Rebels at the break. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.55am EDT 02:55 It was a rapid end to the half of footy at the ‘G. North kicking 6 to 2 in the opening term, the Dees flipping that in the second stanza, including the last three. They’re still targeting Shaun Higgins around the ball, North captain on the telly saying they need to “do a better job” of helping him out after the breather. Mitch Hannan has three of those Melbourne majors. Most of the highlights are blokes hitting each other or trying to hit each other or pretending they have been hit. It’s been a really good game of footy, let’s take nothing away from it. For all that, the main talking point on the world world web is the North banner from before the game. They let Brent Harvey write the message. Events speak for themselves sometimes, don’t they? 3AW Football (@3AWisfootball) "Boomer's given himself a bit of a pump-up!" #AFLDeesNorth pic.twitter.com/U6vsoY1cfA May 21, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.41am EDT 02:41 Half time in the footy, I’ll be back with this in a tic.

If they can close this out they’ll be top of the table heading into next weekend’s Super Netball final round. Thanks again to Claire Daly for her updates. The Adelaide side again swapped their shooting combo, with Glasgow coming back on to replace Bailey. The frequent shuffling of players has been one of the criticisms levelled at the Thunderbirds this season, though it’s hard to know what else they can do at this stage when their combinations clearly aren’t working. Emily Mannix has a fantastic quarter, with several circle intercepts (most devastatingly, most of which saw an end to Thunderbirds’ attempts to convert turnovers). Tegan Philip still looking a little out of sorts, but Kumwenda is more than making up for it with one of her strongest games of the season. And that’s saying something. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.29am EDT 02:29 Super Ruggers! I think they call this a ‘derby’ between Melbourne and NSW, or the Rebels and Tahs as they prefer. The backdrop is the southerly side’s shocking season, having won just one game in ten starts. During the week the ARU tried to buy the club with a view to shutting it down as part of the competition’s aim to lose as Australian side. The club, naturally, said no being purchased/eliminated. It’s going to get worse before it gets better. The Waratahs have won 10 of their last 12 between the two, but have lost their last four games at home – where today’s fixture is taking place, the Sydney Football Stadium. 16 minutes in, they have a try each. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.22am EDT 02:22 Phwoar! It’s firing up at the MCG! Melbourne have kicked the last three and it is game on, North’s lead narrowing to nine. But it’s the niggle that have the crowd up and about, Bernie Vince copping a punch to the guts from Cunnington! Vince tried to take his head off before the whack. He’ll get a week for that. It stems from a stoush in the first term where Higgins was involved in a clip off the ball as well with Oliver. Vince gave Higgins plenty of attention following that. All happening. Oh and an utterly superb set-shot snap from 40m by Mason Wood running from the MCC pocket. Higgins now lands a set shot and gives it the big ones at the opposing number Vince! Good stuff, this. They lead by 21. phil withall (@phil_withall) @collinsadam this is how i imagine your working environment pic.twitter.com/Wl5SeZraUv May 21, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.10am EDT 02:10 Half-time in the Super Netball, the Vixens just doing enough. Thanks again to Claire Daly from The Net Effect. Vixens have extended their lead over the Thunderbirds, 34-29 at half time. Adelaide is certainly making them work for it though. Glasgow was pulled off this quarter, with Karyn Bailey moving into GS and Erin Bell coming out to GA. An interesting choice given the strong shooting for Adelaide, but perhaps Dan Ryan saw momentum starting to slip and made the call. Overall, the Thunderbirds’ attacking play has been patient, smooth and quite confident. Emily Mannix and Jo Weston are working well in the circle together, but it’s the intensity in the Vixens’ centrecourt players – particularly captain Kate Moloney and Liz Watson – that is helping the Vixens whisk any turnovers down to Philip and Kumwenda quickly. On that note – some classic aerial play from Kumwenda this quarter. Exhilarating to watch as always! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.07am EDT 02:07 30-20 the final score at Newcastle. What a mess for the hosts, going down after taking a 14-0 lead to the break. Penrith go into the bye with back to back wins for the first time this season, keeping their season vaguely alive. They face the Bulldogs after that. Next up on NRL Sunday are the Bulldogs, up against their traditional rivals the Roosters at Olympic Stadium - 9th v 5th respectively. Sydney got over the line by four points when they last played in round two and had a big 48-10 win last week against Parra. An unchanged team too – nothing better in footy at this point of the season. The Bulldogs had a shocker last week, beaten by the Cowboys sans Thurstons. Surely they’ll bounce back to continue their consistently inconsistent season, in and out of the eight. NRL (@NRL) Hear from @sydneyroosters coach Trent Robinson in the lead up to #NRLBulldogsRoosters.#NRL pic.twitter.com/8AT9RX6WgX May 21, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.57am EDT 01:57 Big issues for Melbourne, North have already had 13 shots on goal (6.7). But we should have expected this. North have knocked off Melbourne the last 15 times they have played, dating back to 2006. For a reference point: it came during the same month that John Howard was suggesting Big Brother should be taken off air. Feel old? North are dominating the hit outs via Goldstein, who kicked five last time the teams met in a Bellerive Oval shoot-out in round three last year. Both sides had shots to win the game late. Cracking game of footy. Melbourne, without a recognised ruckman at the moment, are trailing the hit-outs early 20-4. The Demons had their best win last week, coming back from a slow start to run over Adelaide by 41 points. They are legit favs today, North stinking it up so far in 2017. They were especially bad last week, Sydney flogging them by seven goals. But they have Waite back from suspension. That’ll help as they like hoofing it like into the 50. They’re 26 points to the good at the first break. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.47am EDT 01:47 Siren at Docklands! Essendon complete a superb home win against the Eagles by 61 points. “A really well balanced outfit,” Brereton says of the Dons. “It could just be a defining moment in their season,” adds Sandy Roberts. With Dreamtime at the ‘G next weekend coming up. And they’re giving their jackets and scarves a bit of a wave, as is the custom. Okay enough of this, time to move across town to the ‘G for North and the Dees. Late in the first term, North are already three goals clear. Ominous signs for Melbourne. There’s a bit of history to this fixture that I’ll come to in a tic. Check this out. Tekkers. AFL (@AFL) Magnificent tap from Goldstein who puts it on a silver platter for Cunnington. #AFLDeesNorth pic.twitter.com/k2XMGWPR0v May 21, 2017 Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.37am EDT 01:37 Penrith hit the lead in Newcastle! They came from the clouds to get over the line last week after trailing NZ 28-6 at the half. There are worse party tricks to have. Meanwhile, this could this be the fifth (!) time the Knights have blown a half-time lead in 2017. If so, they’ll be where they belong at the bottom of the ladder ahead of the Origin disruption. And as I type, another! They’re just about home here.

Fair enough, too. Good times to be red and black. It’s quarter time at the Super Netball. Thunderbirds with only pride to play for at the bottom of the table, but accounting well for themselves early. This again from The Net Effect’s Claire Daly: Vixens lead 17-16 at the end of the first quarter. An impressive start from the Thunderbirds – it was always going to be crucial for them to not allow an early lead to the home side. Phenomenal stats from their goalers, with Bell on 10/10 and Glasgow on 6/6, while there have been a few rare misses from Philip and Kumwenda. There has been some strong defensive centrecourt action for the Vixens, with Liz Watson taking a blinder of an intercept. It’s early days but it looks like we have a good game on our hands. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.28am EDT 01:28 A quick shout out for the badminton I promised earlier, before we end up with three games of footy and a Super Netball game running at the same time. Here is what I learned yesterday. The Sudirman Cup kicks off today, the World Mixed Team Champs. It is going on at the new courts at the Gold Coast sport and leisure centre, which will host the event at the 2018 Commonwealth Games. 1500 players from 160 countries (!) are in town, including from the biggest badminton nations: Korea, Malaysia, India, Thailand, Japan, Taiwan, Denmark, India and China. The Gold Coast Mayor identifies as a “badminton enthusiast”. Sure sounds it. That’s all I have got now. But standby for some live action at one of the half-time breaks elsewhere.

While we’re not exactly dealing with issues on the level that Franklin Roosevelt did as president during the Great Depression, there’s still plenty of uncertainty that needs some clarifying. But if you’re looking for enlightenment on how the bubbling Fuchsia OS is supposed to work within Google’s mobile strategy, — perhaps replacing Android in the future — then you’re not going to find anything clear. The project was said to have booted up early last year and has recently seen a fairly rapid fit of development as the “Armadillo” UI has come together. It was recently compiled by an outside developer and exhibited for the first time in public. Here’s Dave Burke, VP of engineering for Android: How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is an early stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what’s interesting here is its open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it’s gonna probably pivot and morph. There’s some really smart people on it, people we’ve worked with who are great. and so, kind of exciting to see what happens. But it’s definitely a diff– sort of independent project to Android. and yeah, that’s basically it. Burke makes this effort seem like a moonshot, but as Ars Technica has previously reported, Google has plenty of incentive to move away from the Linux- and Java-based Android into more original code with Fuchsia. Indeed, this would be “sort of [an] independent project to Android.” As of yet, we’ve yet to launch a “Fuchsia Death Watch” segment on the Pocketnow Daily, so keep your fingers crossed the next few years.

Why Should we Archive? Published: Sunday, May 21, 2017, 9:00 [IST] These days, most of us use Google Mail or Gmail to deal with our daily emails. However, the problem no is that we tend to get a lot of emails from our boss, the website we just subscribed, and other random unnecessary emails. Google help you in organizing all these random mail through a tool called Archiving. It will help you clean up the interface without having to spend more time on placing each email into a distinctive folder. Making it simple, archiving is an act of taking an email and placing it in a folder where it will continue to exist without cluttering your inbox. Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! How is archive different from deleting? Deleting an email will directly send it to trash, which in a way is a backup as well, but for a limited amount of time, say 30 days. While using the trash folder to clean up your inbox might seem like a good idea, however, you will most likely lose an email that you might need in the future. Why should we archive? In case if you want an email that has important information like bank details, address, or other info's which you might not need it now, and for some amount of time in which you would have never needed to look back. In case, if you deleted the email thread, you wouldn't be able to look back. If you archived an email, you will no longer have to see it sitting in your inbox, but just a quick search will do.

One of the easiest ways to archive your email individually is to select the mail and swipe it left. If you accidentally send the mail to an archive, Google also offers you an option to undo it. You can quickly turn this feature off if you do it a lot on accident. To do this, open up the navigation drawer -> Settings -> General settings -> swipe to archive -> turn off. Another method is to select the mail individually, which you need to archive and tap on the box icon with an arrow pointing downwards. In case, if you want to clean up a bunch of emails, you can select it and tap on the same box icon.   Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates!

But touch on his passion for coding and why he joined Google’s Code in the Community Programme, and his attention is all yours. “I want to learn more about coding. Especially (the programming language) Scratch, which can be used to make games. Because it’s fun to play those games,” said the Sembawang Primary School Student, who is also among the first 500 kids to be enrolled in the programme. Arshad's current inspiration is the mobile phone game Dream League Soccer, and its accurate portrayal of the beautiful game digitally - from how balls are dribbled, the free kicks made and the penalties saved. But after 10 weeks of programming his own projects under Google’s tutelage, he appears to appreciate the sheer amount of effort that goes into coding seemingly simple actions and animations. “That would be extremely hard! Since these (Google) projects already have such long scripts, can you imagine the more developed game,” said Arshad. “It’ll take the hardest of skills!” Google’s 20-week programme is a multi-level computer science education initiative for children aged 8 to 15, and is funded by the tech giant with support from the Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC), the Eurasian Association (EA), Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) and Yayasan Mendaki. Together, they aim to enable 3,000 kids from less-well-off backgrounds to develop computational thinking and skills for a possible future career in technology.

(Photo: Loke Kok Fai) To be eligible, students would need to be a beneficiary of the four self-help groups, or means-tested as a low-income family by the groups. They may also be eligible if they are currently under the Ministry of Education's Financial Aid Scheme. Speaking at an event marking the completion of the programme’s first term on Saturday (May 20), Google Asia Pacific’s Director of People Operations D N Prasad said plans were in place to further scale the programme to the wider community. “(It’s) also for us to bring in the diversity and make this truly inclusive in the Singapore community. So the invites have been sent to all the other schools and we do hope that the initial success and then the results, the positive results that we will show, will encourage more people to come and work with us in the future,” said Mr Prasad. “We’re trying to drive (this) long-term, with a long-term vision. It doesn’t matter who’s driving it – there needs to be just many players with the right intent and heart in the right place. And it’s our way of adding to the community and playing our part in the community as well as in partnership with everything the Government is doing or other institutions might be working on as well.” SINDA President Indranee Rajah, who paid the students a visit, said coding was something that students should acquire naturally through fun and play so that it becomes an integral part of life. Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law Indranee Rajah participates with students at the Google Asia Pacific offices. (Photo: Loke Kok Fai) “We didn’t want to put it as part of the formal school curriculum because that makes it yet another subject that you have to learn and test and be marked for. You don’t want to do that - you want it in the context of play,” said Ms Indranee, who is also Senior Minister of State for Finance and Law.  “If you expose somebody at a young age, you allow them the freedom to absorb this and to play with it and to let them create with it, it just becomes something that is an inherent skill. And hopefully as they go forward in life, they will not have any fear of IT, of coding, and they will be well equipped for the future economy.” Ms Indranee also highlighted grassroots and Government efforts such as Tiong Bahru Community Centre’s subsidised coding course for kids, as well as the Infocomm Media Development Authority’s Digital Maker Programme. GREATER EXPOSURE NEEDED IN SCHOOLS: PARENTS Parents Channel NewsAsia spoke with appreciated the opportunity to allow their child greater exposure to computing and programming literacy. Some pointed out that just a handful of schools offered computing and programming - whether as part of the formal syllabus or not. “If they can introduce this into the schools it’ll be good. But if (students) have to go out to learn it, parents may say the pocket’s a bit tight,” said Gary Siriniwas, a father who sent his 10- and 12-year-old children for Google’s course. Gary Siriniwas (R) is introduced to a micro:bit, used by his children participating in the programme. (Photo: Loke Kok Fai) Lessons or training pitched at younger students or beginners by local third-party external groups could range from S$150 for six sessions to thousands of dollars for in-depth courses, according to checks by Channel NewsAsia. “If they can put it in the schools and then charge it as part of school fees, people will do it. And we must do it or we’ll be left behind,” said Mr Siriniwas. “It’s just like what China does - they get their children at five-years-old, teach them gymnastics, they become the world’s best. We can adopt the same thing - train them up at a small age, and then they’ll be one of the best people in the world in future. “ Jess Eng, who enrolled her 15 year-old-daughter in Google’s programme, said she agreed that there is merit in introducing programming and computing as an examinable subject for the Primary School Leaving Examination - as an optional subject for students with potential. “You see the technology - you can’t live without a phone these days. So it’s very different from our time 20 years back, our parents’ time,” said Ms Eng. “You should forsee down the road, what you should be doing for your kids.” Registration for the 2018 cohort of the Code in the Community Programme will open at the end of the year.

Dave Burke, Google Vice President of Engineering for Android, speaks during the opening keynote address at the Google I/O 2017 Conference. Image: Getty Images/ By Karissa Bell2017-05-20 13:55:39 UTC Though we got out first peek at Android O back in March, Google finally revealed  more details this week at its I/O developers conference about the soon-to-drop version of Android. Though we're still quite a ways away from the official release, we now a lot more about the update. At first glance, many of the new changes are subtle, building on updates Google introduced last year with Nougat. (Yes, it's another boring year for Android.) SEE ALSO: Google is boring now, and that's bad news for innovation Still, there are quite a few features to look forward to, here's what's caught our eye so far. 1. No more broken emoji ☐ Tired of missing out on new emoji? Android O will help ensure you never miss out on the latest releases. A new feature for developers lets them integrate a new emoji library that automatically fills in missing emoji even if you don't have it available yet in your keyboard. The new emoji feature will help fill in missing characters. Image: google 2. Smart Sharing Android O is able to understand what's in your photos and recommend specific apps and actions based based on what's in it the composition and your prior behavior. "If a user takes a photo of a receipt, Android O can suggest an expense-tracking app; if the user takes a selfie, a social media app can better handle the image," Google says. This also applies to videos, URLs, text, and other types of content — your phone can learn what you typically do with different types of content to improve its recommendations. 3. Cleaner Icons Android developers can now create an array of icons to match the styles for different devices. This mean if you use a phone that defaults to round app icons, apps that have typically used square icons now have the ability to use round ones instead. Image: google 4. Notification Snoozing Android O is placing a lot of emphasis on improving notifications. One notable tweak will be the ability to snooze a notification for later.  5. Badge Notifications  One of the biggest changes to notifications is the addition of badge notifications — small dots that appear over an app icon to indicate a new notification from that app. Additionally, you can long press on an app to check its notifications.  Image: google 6. Background colors for notifications  Another small but noticeable way Google is redesigning the look and feel of notifications: Developers will have the ability to enable background colors for notifications from their app.  But don't expect your notifications tray to look extra colorful — Google recommends developers "only use this feature in notifications for ongoing tasks which are critical for a user to see at a glance," like navigation or phone calls. 7. Notification Channels Besides just changing the look and feel of notifications, Android O is letting users have much more fine-grained control over which notifications they see in the first place with something called notification channels. Notification channels let you decide which types of notifications you want to see from your apps. Not many developers have had a chance to take advantage of this yet but as you can see in this example from the Google app, it lets you individually mute certain categories of notifications. 8. New Android TV Launcher  In addition to getting new superpowers thanks to Google Assistant, Android TV is getting a redesigned launcher menu that emphasizes content discovery. Image: google 9. New animation styles This one is a little more subtle: Android O is adding support for a new animation style called physics-based animation. "Physics-based animation relies on the laws of physics to manifest a high degree of realism in animation. In our day-to-day life, when a change occurs, it comes with a physical transition that is natural for us to recognize. " Image: google This will manifest in a few different styles of animations, but one is a new type called "fling animation," which helps you slow down motion at the end of a graphic. 10. Picture-in-picture It's been mentioned before but it bears repeating: Android O is getting support for picture-in-picture that works with any app, not just YouTube. It will take some time before more developers start adopting the feature, which is pretty buggy in the current developer preview, but PiP will definitely level up your multitasking.  WATCH: This gigantic vending machine spits out actual Ferraris Topics: Android, android-o, apps-and-software, Apps and Software, Google, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Whether at home or on the go, your Assistant is here to help. #io17 pic.twitter.com/a6T20HwnU9 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google is finally bringing its powerful AI assistant to iPhones. As everyone from Microsoft to Samsung comes out with their own version, assistants are likely to be the next most important way to control your phone. Previously, operating systems were restrictive in nature. If you had an iPhone, Apple controlled your experience. Now with assistants like Siri, Google and Alexa being an increasingly dominant way to use your phone, it'll be the company that has the best assistant that will control your experience - and Google has a huge advantage with its knowledge graph. Instagram finally gets face filters  After a months long feature by feature cloning of Snapchat, Instagram's finally gets Snapchat's most iconic feature - the lenses, or as Instagram calls them "face filters." There are only eight filters for now, but Instagram is soon likely to have its own wide array of filters. Messenger gets a new layout Image: facebook messenger Facebook Messenger has an all new home screen. It now contains tabs for Messages, people who are “Active now" or online, and favorite groups. There’s also a new bottom bar for Home, Calls, Camera, People and Games. The Camera is a much more prominent part of Messenger than before, likely due to the Messenger Day feature. Uber adds transit information to Android Image: uber The ride-hailing service announced on Tuesday that its Android app will now allow users to easily access real-time public transportation data.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 319 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares533 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated.

Rematch of man vs machine in ancient game By Afp Published: 22:22 EDT, 20 May 2017 | Updated: 22:22 EDT, 20 May 2017 e-mail Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo will face the world's top-ranked Go player, China's 19-year-old Ke Jie, in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI It's man vs machine this week as Google's artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo faces the world's top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI. China's 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee's loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer programme had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo's win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on "intuition." Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo's triumph fuelled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driverless cars or "smart homes", but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. "AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered," Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week's matches. AI's ultimate goal is to create "general" or multi-purpose, rather than "narrow," task-specific intelligence -- something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. - Sci-fi nightmare? - But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines "wake up" and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, "potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand." Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a "pretentious prick". After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. "Bring it on," he said on China's Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent -- cheekily calling itself "The Master" -- was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. "Even that was not AlphaGo's best performance," Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. "It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well." Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of "deep neural networks" containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught -- having played millions of games against itself after initial programming.

China’s 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grandmaster Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee’s loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer programme had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM’s Deep Blue defeating chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo’s win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on “intuition.” Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo’s triumph fuelled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driverless cars or “smart homes”, but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. “AlphaGo’s successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered,” Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week’s matches. AI’s ultimate goal is to create “general” or multi-purpose, rather than “narrow,” task-specific intelligence — something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. Sci-fi nightmare? But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines “wake up” and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, “potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand.” Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a “pretentious p****”. After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. “Bring it on,” he said on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent — cheekily calling itself “The Master” — was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. “Even that was not AlphaGo’s best performance,” Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. “It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well.” Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of “deep neural networks” containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain.  It is partly self-taught — having played millions of games against itself after initial programming. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Father of the Internet’ Vint Cerf says we should reach for the stars Watch out in a world of connected objects, cyber specialists warn Ready, Set, Go!

Google Working On Chromebook Emulator For Android Devs Next Story Prev Story 16 hrs ago Read more: Ubergizmo So we know that Google is aiming for the Chromebook to run Android apps, however since Android apps are clearly designed for smartphones, this means that when used on a device with a larger display liked a laptop, it won't look the same and the experience won't be ideal, but Google has a plan to help with that. It seems that Google is working on a Chromebook emulator for Android app developers As the name suggests, this is an emulator designed to mimic a Chromebook or a device with a larger display, so that when Android developers are planning to make their apps compatible with Chrome OS, they can use the emulator to ensure that their apps are optimized for devices with larger displays.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

That’s the advice from internet pioneer Vinton Gray Cerf, who is often referred to as one of the “Fathers of the Internet” for his role in co-developing the internet protocol suite and the architecture of the internet. With the internet firmly entrenched in our daily lives — affecting how we interact with each other, how we conduct business, and how we perceive the world — how much further can the internet go? An intragalactic network, or an internet for our galaxy, is the vision by Cerf, who bears the title of Google vice president and Chief Internet Evangelist. The future of the internet is going to get “bigger, faster... and integrated into our lives far more than it is today,” Cerf said in an interview with TODAY. In the not so distant future, internet-enabled devices will dominate the new wave. The widely-touted ‘Internet of Things’, or the connectivity of everyday objects, will be prevalent, together with machine learning and interactive artificial intelligence, said Cerf. “I think the internet will simply surround us in the future. It will be built into our offices, homes, vehicles, and maybe in our persons. It will just be there to serve us in the same way that electrical power is expected to come out of the wall at need.” Making the internet more secure The internet has certainly ignited a new economic growth engine for the world, creating enormous amounts of wealth and business for people with the applications that sit on top of it, said Cerf, citing the case of Google. Cerf added he is “pretty happy” with the results of the internet. The advent of the smartphone boom has further aided the growth of the internet community, he said. Today about 3.5 billion people are online. Cerf forecasts that another two to three billion people will go online by 2020. As benefits and economic gains are generated by the internet, the future of the internet also requires safety and security. “There’s no trivial cure for this,” said Cerf. To work towards a safer and more secure internet environment, the technical community has to minimise the mistakes they make when they write operating systems software and applications software, he said. Individuals need to be more aware about internet security and avoid unsecured products. “We have to recognise that if we are going to build devices for the net, we have to take extra steps to make sure we can protect ourselves from being invaded or controlled by people who are not authorised to do that,” said Cerf. Digital signatures, or other kinds of cryptographic methods can help, but “improving our ability to write software with fewer bugs in it and improving our ability to update software when we discover there are bugs, is a very important part of making the network safer for everyone to use.” As individual users, we can also play a part in practising internet security, such as adopting two-factor authentication, not clicking on potential phishing messages as well as not buying equipment and gadgets that are unsafe, Cerf said. Vision for the future Having worked on developing the system since its early days, Cerf says the internet was planned to be a global system since 1973. The power of the internet is far from its saturation point. The design of the internet allows it to adapt to new technologies and support new applications pretty much without an end in sight, shared Cerf. The internet was “designed to be expandable,” he said. The idea was “to allow new kinds of applications to be built on top of it.” He explained that the internet can support an arbitrarily large number of new applications, whether it is “voice or video or a piece of the webpage or a document or something else.” “That was a very, very deliberate design choice on our part, in order to permit that kind of exploration and growth… so there isn’t really any limitation to what you can do with software except your imagination and what you can programme.” Hence, the limitless boundaries of the internet – even beyond our world. There is “real incentive” to develop intragalactic networking, due to the solar systems that have been found in space, said Cerf. However, some barriers to the technology include communicating faster than the speed of light which is still a mystery to be solved. Currently, there are already developments to deliver scientific data back to researchers on Earth using a prototype interplanetary network between Earth, Mars and the International Space Station. “That’s functional, that’s real, that’s running. As new missions get launched we will continue to grow the interplanetary backbone. So from my point of view we have an architecture that we are pretty confident will work for solar system scale.” “Right now the hard part is doing it between here and Alpha Centauri (the closest star system to the solar system) or Beta Centauri. The Centauri system, that’s 4.3 light years away. That’s going to be harder to do,” Cerf said. Much as his sights are on the future, this “Father of the Internet” insists we do not forget history. Cerf is currently working on solving the problem of preserving digital content – photos, movies, documents, programmes, databases, application and operating system software. “We need technologies to run old software on emulated old hardware so we can see (in future) what our ancestors wrote, Tweeted, Facebooked or YouTubed about… Fortunately, it looks as if there may be some long-term solutions to this problem. But there is still a lot of work to be done to make this feasible.” — TODAY                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week ‘Father of the Internet’ Vint Cerf says we should reach for the stars Watch out in a world of connected objects, cyber specialists warn Ready, Set, Go!

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | May 19, 2017 -- 19:22 GMT (12:22 PDT) | Topic: Innovation Artificial intelligence is "the driving force of the fourth industrial revolution," Google's Fei-Fei Li argued during a panel discussion on the final day of Google's I/O developer conference. AI, she added, "has the potential to tranform the way humans live, work, communicate." That said, technologists have only just begun realizing the impact of AI. As it matures, vision is going to be the "killer app of AI," said Li, the chief scientist of AI and machine learning for Google's cloud unit. Reiterating points she recently made to TechCrunch, Li noted that 540 million years ago, vision was likely the driving force behind the Cambrian Explosion -- a relatively short period of time over which a great diversity of life forms appeared. "When eyes were first developed in animals, suddenly animal life becomes proactive... evolution has changed," she explained. Hundreds of millions of years later, humans are the most intelligent visual animals, with half of the human brain dedicated to visual processing. Meanwhile, the sheer scale of visual data in our current world speaks to its importance: It's estimated that more than 80 percent of all of cyberspace is in pixel form, Li noted. Google Cloud Platform customers, she noted, are asking about capabilities like video processing and video analytics. Computer vision, she stressed is "one of the most important elements of machine intelligence and the transformation of enterprise and companies." While the last 10 years have brought significant progress in basic perception tasks, such as object recognition and image tagging, Li called the next big phase "vision plus X." In other words, the transformation of enterprise will come with combining the capabilities of computer vision with other fields of study. For instance, she noted that vision plays a "fundamental" role in communication, opening up opportunities to combine vision and language capabilities for functions like indexing videos. Vision also has huge potential in biological sciences and robotics, she said. At I/O, Google showcased its advances in computer vision, which are helping to drive its AI-first strategy. The company revealed how it's bringing computer vision capabilities to various products this year, starting with Google Assistant and Google Photos. Artificial intelligence has reached its current inflection point, Li argued, because of the convergence of three factors: the maturation of machine learning tools, Moore's Law and the improvement of hardware and the emergence of big data. While this is a "historical moment" for AI, "it's just the beginning," she said. "The tools and technologies we've developed are really the first few drops of water in the vast ocean of what AI can do." Daphne Koller, chief computing officer at Google-founded Calico Labs, noted that big data is not yet as ubiquitous as some may think. "We might like to think big data is, at this point, the solution to everything," she said on the panel with Li. While it plays a major role in some sectors, "in others we are unfortunately still in the medium or even small data regime." With that in mind, she said there's still a need for "balancing human intuition... with the data we're acquiring."

What Happened to Transparency? May 21, 2017 5 1436 Simon Kolawolelive!, Email: simon.kolawoe@thisdaylive.com I need your help please. At the annual Nigerian jamboree to the Offshore Technology Conference (OTC) in Houston, Texas, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, the minister of state for petroleum resources, told a “world press conference” on May 5, 2017 that Nigeria’s refineries would soon have new investors. He said 26 investors had indicated interest in the epileptic refineries. “By September, we will unveil the investors for the refineries,” the minister said smoothly, typically. “When we came onboard, the refineries were not working but as we speak, we have sizeable investment portfolio for them to an extent that we don’t know who to partner with for the investment.” Let’s say I didn’t go to school at all. Or let’s say it was evening school that I attended. These would still be my takeaways from the minister’s proclamations: one, our refineries are now in a position to attract investment; two, 26 investors have indicated interest in taking over the refineries (on a repair, operate and maintain, ROM, agreement); three, we have not taken a decision yet because there are so many suitors to choose from; and four, we will announce the favoured investors by September. Without attending Harvard Business School, I would still conclude that it appeared the process was going to be competitive and transparent. On May 11, 2017 (six days later, right?) Mr. Wale Tinubu, the CEO of Oando Plc, told the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) that the group had received approval of the government to “repair, operate and maintain” the Port Harcourt Refinery together with “our partner” Agip, a subsidiary of ENI, the Italian company indicted in the Malabu/OPL 245 affair. Tinubu said: “We plan to increase the refinery capacity from 30 per cent to 100 per cent.” Great news, as far I am concerned. We need the refineries back as soon as possible; we have had enough of the endless TAMs gulping billions of naira and spewing out virtually no products for decades. Now this is where I need your help. The last time I checked, with the help of Google, May and September are different months. There are June, July and August in-between. With the help of Google, I also discovered that the gap between when Kachikwu spoke in Houston and when Tinubu spoke in Lagos was a whopping six days — or, to make it simpler, less than one week. There are usually four weeks in a month, and from May 5, when Kachikwu spoke, to September, there are 17 weeks, according to the all-knowing Google. With Tinubu’s disclosure, should we assume that May is the new September? Or that September came early for Oando, Agip and Kachikwu? But I think Google is overrated. There were so many questions it could not answer. For instance, I asked: “Is Oando among the 26 investors Kachikwu boasted about in Houston?” I could not make head or tail of the results. Google came up with “FOX 26 Houston KRIV”. Nonsense. But I got more gibberish for other questions: did Oando and ENI send in a bid? Was it an unsolicited bid? Was it selective tendering? If it was competitive bidding, how many bids were received for Port Harcourt? How much did Oando/ENI bid? How much did others bid? How much did the bidders promise to invest? How many years will the ROM run? Are there concessions for the new operators? I can understand why Google got stuck — that almighty search machine likes transparency. If you do not make your information public, it cannot make it public for you. The best, or should I say the worst, Google would do is to suggest answers that it thinks are related to your questions, even when there is no connection whatsoever. If you google most of the major concessions and major contracts awarded by this government, you will get irrelevant answers on the process. For the same reason: transparency is very scarce in these major deals. We just wake up one day and hear that one company has been awarded a job. Not a word on the process. Don’t get me wrong: I’m not saying Oando should not take over the Port Harcourt Refinery. I have devoted a significant part of my column-writing career to promoting the cause of Nigerian companies. I believe that one day, made-in-Nigeria will be enjoyed all over the world. I want Nigerian companies to fly our flag honourably. Even though I have been called names and subjected to sickening innuendos for promoting Dangote, Globacom, Oando and Innosons, among others, I am not about to repent. Americans are proud of their Apple, Microsoft and Chevron, and my dream is that our people and our companies will become global brands too. That said, though, I am very worried about an emerging pattern in this administration. President Muhammadu Buhari campaigned on the strength of correcting the mistakes and misdeeds of the previous government, but I am seeing too much repetition for it to be coincidental. There is too much secrecy in the way many important things are done, and corruption, need we say, thrives on secrecy. Take away competition, take away transparency, take away accountability, and you have a perfect recipe for corruption. We cannot be sealing deals under the table without revealing the details to Nigerians and then claim we are building an open society. We just woke up one day to learn that GE had secured the concession to take over the railways. How did it happen? What are the details of the deal? Is this the best possible deal Nigeria can get? We were just watching TV one evening and learnt that the federal government had finally signed a renegotiated concession agreement with the Global Steel Holding Limited (GSHL) for Ajaokuta Steel. Up till today, we don’t know the details. Ask questions and what you get as answer is: who paid you to ask? As a journalist, I’m used to the blackmail. I would have quit this job the day I joined if I had to pay attention to personal attacks. By the way, I know a bit about the procurement options. I know of “sole sourcing”, where you go to one provider only because no other provider does it — like buying a Rolls Royce from the maker. “Selective tendering” allows you to approach a few providers who meet certain criteria. There is “repeat procurement”, where you return to earlier provider because of time constraints and because they did a previous job well. All these need strong justifications because you are restricting competition, which is a major element of procurement. And then there is “competitive bidding”, where you throw it open to all. In all, Nigerians deserve to know the process adopted. Get me right. I am not saying anything illegal is being done in the case of the Port Harcourt Refinery. It just lacks transparency. That’s my point. And what about other moral issues? ENI again? As I write this, many Nigerians are being prosecuted or wanted by the EFCC for their involvement in the OPL 245 deal. They are being accused of taking part in an elaborate bribery scheme. But ENI, which is at the centre of it all and is being prosecuted by an Italian prosecutor for its role in the $1.3 billion affair, is cornering more deals in Nigeria without getting as much as a slap on the wrist. The impression being created is that our anti-graft war is very narrow. I sympathise with the government over the limitations imposed by procurement rules, particularly the constraint of speed, but the process was designed for a purpose. More so, this government has been in power for nearly two years, which means a lot could still have been accomplished over the years in spite of the constraints. And, remember, there are many options that can shorten the process which the government has been using for a while now. The biggest headache, though, is that there is too much opaqueness for us to conclude that transparency is a guiding principle. The chaos over the concessioning of Port Harcourt Refinery is a very good example. Dissonance. =========== “I sympathise with the government over the limitations imposed by procurement rules, particularly the constraint of speed, but this government has been in power for nearly two years, which means a lot could still have been accomplished over the years in spite of the constraints” =========== AND FOUR OTHER THINGS NORTHERN ELDERS Dr. Junaid Mohammed, the northern “elder” who promised Nigerians hell if power did not return to the “north” in 2011, is at it again. This time, the “elder” says if Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo becomes president, for any reason, before 2019, the “north” will insist on getting fresh two terms starting from 2019. What an elder! Any society with this character as an elder is doomed. He is certainly not my elder. It may interest him to know that no part of Nigeria can produce a president all by itself. Go and check the 2015 election results. Buhari would not have won by northern votes alone. Statements like this can set the nation on fire. Reckless. BUDGET SIGNING The 2017 federal budget is now ready and, all things being equal, the next thing is presidential assent. Since President Muhammadu Buhari is on medical leave and Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is the “co-ordinator” of activities, many have asked: “Who signs?” Alhaji Lai Mohammed, information minister, said “that decision will be taken when the budget is transmitted to the presidency”. On his part, Senator Ita Enang, special adviser to the president on national assembly matters, said, before backtracking, that “the budget will be transmitted to Mr President and the president will assent to the budget.” Have these guys ever read section 145 (1) of the 1999 constitution at all? Amusing. MACRON WAVE Hurray! The national assembly is planning to amend several sections of the 1999 constitution to allow younger people to contest for office. In the wave of the election of 39-year-old Emmanuel Macron as French president, the #NotTooYoungToRun campaign has been reborn in Nigeria. The proposal is to reduce the qualification ages from 40 to 30 (presidential), 35 to 30 (governorship) and 30 to 25 (national assembly). But wait. We often think the law is our problem, yet how many 30-years-olds get appointed as ministers despite the fact that the constitution allows it? In any case, changing the law is easier; preparing our youth for leadership is the real deal. Imperative. BEST AND WORST Patrick Asadu, a member of the house of reps, has said the worst PDP government is better than the current APC administration. The lawmaker from Enugu state said: “The PDP government was not and could never have been perfect, and [only a] few human endeavours are totally perfect, but the worst of the PDP government is 100 times better than the best of the present APC government.” Given that the PDP ruled Nigeria for 16 years, during which the country did not exactly become South Korea, and APC has only ruled for two years, can Asadu be more circumspect? I agree that APC is fumbling, but it is not as if PDP set the world on fire in its first two years either. Exaggeration.

B. JOSHUA Backpage On The Greatness of Nigeria Backpage Nigeria and the Story Tellers obinnna77 Typical. You couldn’t resist harping on Dr Kachikwu’s ‘smoothness’, could you? Grates on your nerves, doesn’t it? Such pettiness detracts from the weight of your analysis of his commentary. We still remember your prior peevishness: Kachikwu dressing like a masquerade, Kachikwu’s rumoured favouring of family. Falaye Adeyinka Mr Obinna I do enjoy your contribution on this platform and I would like to agree with you to some extent that kola has been somewhat critical about Kachikwu since the early days of this Administration.But can you honestly say that the Minister has been consistence with his public pronouncement even in simple matters.For instance this is the same minister who once told us that the 3 refineries are working up 50 to 60% installed capacity and that he is looking at the data to determine how much our daily consumption actually is sometimes in 2015.We all know that the former statement is false and the answer to the latter question is still flying in the air! And so the issues Klola is raising today are very germane and on spot considering that we have charted this tainted and unprofitable path before (Obasojo/Yaaradua). I feel very strongly that there is a merit in this article (it should be depersonalized) and should be given national discuss.Attention! ifeanyi victor The south-south people will not see this looting of their land resources through this ungodly arrangement by north and tinubu clan and rise up against it. No bidding,no transparency,just foist oando on nigerians through this shoddy and illegal deal,so much for buhari and pastor osibanjo and apc transparency. North and south west have looted this country’s patrimony for so long. Thompson Iyeye We are truly in the era of the jackal, as far as the press and journalism is concerned in this country. For crying out loud, the press is the fourth estate of the realms, whose charge is to educate and inform the public on any issue including happenings in the executive, legislative and judicial arms of government, to ensure they function appropriately. There was indeed a time when the general public could depend on the press to discharge such functions creditably, but those days are long gone. What we have today is a docile and corrupt press with timid but greedy and dishonest journalists who are too glad to lie and mislead the public. Why would this journalist be asking what happened to transparency on this issue of the refineries, without doing the important job of investigating and telling the public what actually transpired. A good journalist through investigation would have been giving the details of what did happen and why, for instance, how the decisions were reached, individuals who took part from both sides of the negotiations, the value of the deal, how much money (if any) changed hands under the table, etc, etc. It is good to raise questions about government dealings, but not good enough without doing the investigative work to expose the guts of such deals. That is the stuff good journalism is made of, which keeps governments on their toes to make them more transparent and accountable, and accordingly less corrupt. Our journalists need to be more investigative. Simon Kolawole should please go back to the drawing board and truly tell us what has happened. We are otherwise, not impressed by this half measure. Jon West Simon Kolawole, I have always followed your shenanigans on Thisday and your Cable newspaper, but have never read anyone castigating you for promoting OandO, Dangote, Innosson and Glo. You have never promoted any of these companies, except perhaps Dangote and for obvious reasons. Anyway getting into the gist of this wishy washy article, who do you expect to extract the truth about the opacity in the operations of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria? Are you not a journalist, trained to penetrate political, economic and social fortresses in order to educate the people on the realities of the soceity? You have managed to make journalism in Nigeria a profession of griots, simple story tellers rehashing rumours and innuendos mixed with very little facts. This is not acceptable in the second decade of the third millennium of christendom in Nigeria. As for the refinery imbroglio, it is the usual Nigerian business model – Say a lot before thinking through the process and then do what you really wanted to do in the first place. NNPC invited Japan Gasoline Company(JGC), the contractors that built the Port Harcourt refinery, to rehabilitate and expand the refinery. The talks are still on-going, while the story of OandO and Agip is unfolding. This is the typical scammers mentality, the mentality of the Nigerian elite ,both in business and politics, and why nothing works. We have been talking about revamping the refineries for the past twenty years and nothing ever gets done, because every succeeding Government has officials that take their personal business interests more seriously than the national interest, hence Kachikwu’s dash to OandO, his great friend Wale Tinubu’s company, instead of the proven capability of JGC, the original contractors that delivered this relatively modern refinery in 1990. Bottom line, all this griot story-telling will not help matters and in any case Kachikwu, OandO and Agip have no interest in the efficient operations of the refineries. All these shenanigans are geared towards another scam, in which the Nigerian people will be made to pay the usual price of inefficieny and corruption. Men repeat history and then blame history for repeating itself. 990,810FansLike 756,325FollowersFollow Latest News Acting President Leads Farewell to Adebayo, a Nigerian Army Original May 21, 2017 In Emotion-laden Event, 82 Chibok Girls Reunite with Families May 21, 2017 INEC in Dilemma Over APC Midterm Convention May 21, 2017 Army: Why We Established Military Base in Daura, Buhari’s Hometown May 21, 2017 Dogara: We’re Fully Committed to Making Laws May 21, 2017 THISDAY Today (Download) Download Saturday 20th May 2017 May 21, 2017 0 Recent Comments Jon West on What Happened to Transparency?

Obviously one of the bigger steps forward in that area was the new Google Assistant that was unveiled last fall. In the beginning the app was only available to a very small minority, namely the Pixel users, but the company has expanded to other Android phones as well as their new smart speaker Google Home. Now, however, Google has gone way further and even brought it to the biggest competitor's flagship, the iPhone. Already Google Assistant has said to be in over 100 million devices but with the addition of iPhone and other phones Google aims capturing more of the enormous 2 billion smartphone market. Obviously Siri will still have the edge on iOS as it is the only assistant you can access straight from you home button but Google has created a widget which gets you to the Google Assistant pretty swiftly. But this is still only the tip of the iceberg according to Google. At Google I/O the company announced Google Assistant SDK which allows developers and manufacturers to bring Assistant with its AI capabilities to any kind of application and hardware whether it be a speaker, a coffee maker or a completely new type of device. Google also announced that it'll be expanding to new languages. By the end of the year Assistant will understand for example German, French, Italian, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese.

Meet Dragon's Breath: The World's New Hottest Chilli Confirmed: Google Home Is Coming To Australia Post Pornhub, Australian Pornography Is Fighting For Survival Get All Your Fitness Tracking Data In One Place David Nield May 21, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android apps fitbit fitness fitness trackers google fit ios apps iphone apps mobile apps wearables Share You've got data pouring in from your connected fitness tracker, your smartphone, your smartwatch, the smart scales in your bathroom and the dieting app you use to log your meals — so how do you get all of this information in one place? It isn't easy, but here are a few pointers to help. Image: Fitbit Fortunately for those looking to consolidate their health and fitness data, most of these services have APIs, so there are options for pooling stats from different devices and apps. It's what Google and Apple have been trying to do with their own health and fitness portals, though with a limited amount of success so far. Using Google Fit Image: Google Google Fit now comes as standard on Nexus and Pixel devices, using the sensors packed into your phone (or Android Wear watch) to keep track of steps, sleep, and other measurements automatically. As you would expect from Google, it's slick and available on the web, but we're yet seeing much in the way of support from non-Google devices, even though Google Fit was first announced way back in summer 2014. Image: Screenshot There are a decent number of apps that work with Fit: Strava, Sleep As Android, and Runtastic, for example, so if you use these apps to track your running, walking, sleeping, and workouts then Google Fit is a decent option for consolidating everything in one place. What's missing is direct compatibility with the major wearable makers, the likes of Fitbit and Misfit, though Withings devices are supported. Compatible apps (here's a list) are usually connected from within each individual app's settings, so you'll need to dig around to find the option. From within the Google Fit app on Android, choose Settings from the menu then tap Apps connected to see what's piping data into Google Fit. Using Apple Health Image: Apple It's a similar story with Apple Health as it is for Google Fit — strong integration with Apple's own kit and support for some big-name apps, but more limited compatibility with actual devices you might be wearing on your body (unless it's the Apple Watch). Health is much broader in scope than Fit, acting as a repository for all of your medical data, not just the number laps your ran this morning. It also goes into greater depth when analysing your progress and making recommendations about where you can improve (like when to stop and take a breath). Image: Screenshot There's no easy way of checking which apps work with Apple Health and which don't, but as with Google Fit, Strava and Runtastic have joined the party, and Health links to apps from Misfit, Withings and Garmin too, so you can in theory use any of their wearables and pipe data through the default apps then on to Apple Health. Fitbit is the big hold-out. As with Google Fit, access is granted to Apple Health through the individual apps. Tap the Sources link on the front page of the Health app to see what you've linked up and adjust which variables each of the apps is allowed to edit. Using IFTTT Image: Screenshot We're unashamed fans of IFTTT (If This Then That), and the service plugs into just about every fitness tracking API out there including Fitbit, Jawbone, Withings, Misfit, Strava and more. This makes it even broader in scope than the offerings from Google and Apple. It's a shame then that IFTTT doesn't work with Google Fit or Apple Health directly. IFTTT isn't a repository for your data either, so once you've collected all the information from your various trackers and apps, you need to put it somewhere else. Fortunately, there are lots of options to pick from. You can pipe your statistics out to Evernote, for example, or a Google Drive spreadsheet, or OneNote, or even a blog post if you want the world to know what you're up to. A bit of trial and error might be required to get the data in the shape you need, but you've got plenty of scope for collecting and analysing feedback from multiple apps and devices. If you want to log your daily Fitbit stats to a Google Drive sheet, for example, choose Fitbit then Daily activity summary as your trigger, then Google Drive and Add row to a spreadsheet as your action. With a bit of touching up on the sheet itself, you can get a very decent-looking record of your exercise and sleep. Then you can import information from the spreadsheet into various apps. Using Exist We may well have saved the best until last. Exist draws in a ton of data from a range of fitness apps and devices, and will even go to the trouble of analysing it for you, letting you know which days you're most productive, and even how the weather affects your exercise. Exist works with Fitbit, Jawbone, Misfit, Withings, Google Fit, Apple Health (and the Apple Watch), Strava, Moves, Runkeeper and more besides. It can also pull in data from the likes of Last.fm, Spotify, Twitter, Dark Sky and RescueTime to try and chart your exercise against other factors like social media activity and how much music you're listening to. A subscription to Exist will set you back $US6 ($8) a month but there is a 30-day free trial available so you can work out whether it's for you. Once you've got yourself up and running, you can connect various services with just a few clicks. The online interface is a breeze to use and lets you dig into your stats in great detail, letting you chart different variables against each other. It also tries to pick out trends for you, letting you know everything from which music artist gets you exercising more to how your tweet patterns boost your step count.

And as usual, instead of enjoying them responsibly, the internet is hard at work trying to find ways to make spinners as dangerous as playing with firecrackers. This is why we can't have fun things. Post Pornhub, Australian Pornography Is Fighting For Survival Mark Serrels 19 May 2017 1:00 PM The Australian porn scene is struggling. Post-Pornhub, there's simply less demand for paid content. But if history has proven anything, it's that pornography finds a way. We spoke to some of Australia's premier porn performers and producers. They're struggling, they're doing it tough, but they're using technology (and their innate sense of hustle) in a last gasp fight for survival. Want Lifehacker's email newsletter?

Home Video Editions Store Search Search Search Sign In / Sign Up Live You Should Be Using Opera Instead Of Chrome, And Other Facts WHAT WE LEARNED THIS WEEK You Should Be Using Opera Instead Of Chrome, And Other Facts Dan Fallon May 18 2017, 7:54 PM 29 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain ​Welcome to What We Learned This Week, a digest of the most important facts from the past few days. This week: Chrome is a garbage browser, cars have gotten a lot safer and MP3s are a dying breed. Do Yourself A Favor And Ditch Chrome  It's difficult to tear yourself away from Google. Even if you don't use an Android phone, there's a good chance you use Google search, Gmail, Google Docs and the like. And also Chrome. And if you use Chrome, there's a good chance that you hate it, because Chrome is a massive resource hog that slows your computer down to a standstill just because you dared to have two YouTube videos open at once.  But it doesn't have to be like this. As Motherboard's Jason Koebler writes, there is a better way, and that way is Opera, a browser that blends the openness of Chrome (you can still have extensions!) with the not-eating-all-your-RAM part of other browsers. Half the Digg office switched to Opera this week and yeah, we're all happier.  [Motherboard] A Tortoise Is A Weird Pet One of the sad realities of getting a pet is that it will die at some point during your life. For all the joy they bring you during their lives, cats and dogs and the like just don't live as long as we do.  On the other end of the spectrum is a pet sulcata tortoise, which will almost certainly outlive you (though it probably won't come to your funeral). Hanya Yanagihara's story about the sulcata her parents adopted on impulse many years ago is a poignant reflection on death, family and shelled pets.  [New York Times] Cars Have Gotten A Lot Safer In The Last Couple Decades Okay, that shouldn't be a surprise. As with things like gas mileage and in-car tech (farewell, built-in mobile phones), car safety has improved by leaps and bounds since the '90s. To illustrate that change, the New Zealand Automobile Association decided "hey, let's just crash an old car and a new car together." So they did, and here's a snapshot of what a 2015 Toyota Corolla does to a 1998 Corolla:  &amp;lt;img src="http://static.digg.com/images/b833790a0a2148ce9e66b0a76f15dca9_6e8382ef263f4cf59896c0c63941394e_1_post.jpeg" alt="" /&amp;gt;   [Digg] The MP3 Is Dying Chances are you have a pretty solid library of MP3s on one of your devices. Chances are you also haven't been adding many new MP3s to those devices, as the rise of streaming services have replaced not only the need to download tracks, but the very format your music comes in as streaming services have eschewed MP3s.  At the end of the day, you won't notice any difference when you're listening, but if you're the kind of person who gets a little bit sentimental about their carefully curated MP3 library, the news that the Fraunhofer Institute for Integrated Circuits, which held the patent for the MP3, declined to renew the patent recently, effectively killing off the future. Combined with the recent fall of What.CD, it feels like the end of an era for music collectors.  [Quartz] Previously on What We Learned This Week  The Trees Are Dying And We'll Die Next, And Other Facts An Indestructible Bunker Sleeps In Colorado There Are Cocktails That Can Kill Dan Fallon is Head of Editorial at Digg.  UP AND OUT Turkey's Brilliant Tow Trucks Put The US To Shame 48 diggs Video Cars Video With Turkey's side-loading tow truck replacement, a car is loaded and gone in under a minute. 48 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain A CIVIL SERPENT Friendly Human Provides Thirsty Desert Snake With Some Much Needed Water 45 diggs LiveLeak Video Nature Video Animals Curious This poor reptile was slowly slithering through the Empty Quarter Desert in Dubai when a nice person decided to give the little guy a much-needed boost. 45 diggs Save Share Tweet 'nana Blacklist story Blacklist domain LIKE UBER, BUT FOR DEAD STARTUPS The Startup Graveyard Helps You Remember Failed Startups And Learn From Their Mistakes 25 diggs Technology Internet Business Digg Original Economics In today's startup economy, about half of new businesses will fail by their fifth year, be it from leadership issues or simply a bad product.

(Google Maps) Related Stories Living room hike: Google and Nature Conservancy of Canada put N.L. trails online If you're stuck for inspiration about where to go this long weekend — or stuck at home and can't go anywhere — you can take a peek at parks and trails in Manitoba from the comfort of your couch. Two Manitoba trails are now accessible on Google Street View, thanks to a partnership between the tech company and the Nature Conservancy of Canada. "Part of our mandate is also connecting Canadians with nature and trying to get them out on the land," said Andrew Holland, a spokesperson for the nature conservancy. "We figured this is a great way for people and families to see these sites from their own homes, from their own kitchens, from a click of the mouse — check and see what these places look like, and then plan day trips themselves." Explore NCC properties virtually Using Google Trekker, a 50-pound backpack with a camera system on it, staff at the nature conservancy visited Fort Ellice and Elk Glen, Man., to create the panoramas, which include hiking trails, pathways and beaches. The virtual tours went live online earlier this week, along with similar tours for 16 other sites across Canada. Holland said the project aims to connect Canadians with nature. "We tend to overlook the obvious, and we tend to overlook the natural beauty that's in our own backyards and in our areas," he said. The 18 nature conservancy sites showcased in the project were chosen based on how accessible they are to people already, Holland said. "A lot of people think of conservation areas, they think they're fenced off and we can't use it, and that's far from the truth," he said. "We want people out on the lands." Elk Glen is located at the south boundary of Riding Mountain National Park. Fort Ellice is the site of a historic fort, located on Beaver Creek, about 300 kilometres west of Winnipeg.

Published May 21, 2017May 20, 2017 Share Tweet Share Pin it +1 Kaine Agary Kaine Agary What do Aspirin, Hoover, Escalator, Cellophane and Linoleum have in common? They were once protected trademarks but you will find them engraved on headstones in the trademark graveyard. The cause of “death”? Genericide, which happens when brands become the colloquial or generic description for a product or service in a particular class. Google had a recent bout with genericide and only last week a US federal appeals court ruled in its favour. Trademarks are used by companies and manufacturers to distinguish their goods from others. The challenge for companies and manufacturers is the active defence of their trademark against competitors who use either an identical or similar mark in an attempt to take custom from the true owner of the mark and benefit from the success of the true owner of the mark. Companies put in a lot of resources developing their mark –ensuring the quality of their product, marketing their product and managing the reputation of the product. Trademark law protects companies and manufacturers from competitors trying to cash in on the success of their trademark. Trademarks must be distinctive, not merely descriptive. In other words, the mark cannot merely describe the goods or services or their characteristics. The mark must be able to distinguish goods or services of one company from those of another. For this and other reasons, mark owners must police their trademarks to prevent them from ending up in the trademark graveyard. Savvy brand management is essential to ensuring that the trademark does not fall victim to genericide. Genericide is not the only way that companies lose protection of their trademark. Non-use over a period will also cause the mark to lose its protection under intellectual property laws. There is no doubt that Google has become the generic term for conducting a search on the internet. But a court has decided that Google Inc. still enjoys trademark protection over Google. Trouble for the trademark started when in 2012 one Chris Gillespie registered 763 domain names that included the word “google”, for example, “googledisney.com,” “googlebarackobama.net,” and “googlenewtvs.com.” Now this can probably be described as cybersquatting at its most nauseating level. Google, as expected, objected to these registrations and filed a complaint, arguing that the domain names were confusingly similar to the Google trademark and had been registered in bad faith. Google was successful in their complaint with the National Arbitration Forum. Subsequently, a suit was filed in District Court by David Elliott and Chris Gillespie, asking for the cancellation of the Google trademark on the grounds that the word Google is now primarily understood and used as a generic term to describe the act of internet searching. Essentially, the plaintiffs argued that the word Google had now become a verb, as in “I googled it.” The District Court rejected their argument and the plaintiffs appealed. In the Court of Appeal (Ninth Circuit) the decision of the District Court was upheld. Stating the opinion of the Court, Justice Richard Tallman explained the principle, stating, “Genericide occurs when the public appropriates a trademark and uses it as a generic name for particular types of goods or services irrespective of its source. For example, ASPIRIN, CELLOPHANE, and THERMOS were once protectable as arbitrary or fanciful marks because they were primarily understood as identifying the source of certain goods. But the public appropriated those marks and now primarily understands aspirin, cellophane, and thermos as generic names for those same goods.” Addressing the main argument of the plaintiffs, he said, “The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic. See 15 U.S.C. § 1064(3). Instead, a trademark only becomes generic when the ‘primary significance of the registered mark to the relevant public’ is as the name for a particular type of good or service irrespective of its source.” The test, as he put it is a matter of ascertaining the primary significance of the term in the minds of the consumer, whether the term conjures up a connection to the product rather than the producer. “If the relevant public primarily understands a mark as describing “who” a particular good or service is, or where it comes from, then the mark is still valid. But if the relevant public primarily understands a mark as describing “what” the particular good or service is, then the mark has become generic.” So how can brands keep their marks from falling victim to genericide? The first step is in picking the right mark. A mark that is merely descriptive of the product is not a good mark and is unlikely to be registered as a trademark because it lacks the requirement that a trademark be distinctive. The mark’s purpose is to identify the source of the product, not merely to describe the product. For this reason, arbitrary or fanciful marks with words and phrases that have no commonly understood connection to the product are the better option for companies developing a new brand. Think of marks like Apple and computers; Ivory and soap; or Elephant and detergent. Use words that have no ordinary meaning. Use a word from your native language. Just make sure that your mark is distinctive. The second thing that trademark owners must do is police the market for trademark infringement. Be mindful of the use of the trademark, for instance by competitors in advertising their own product, and pursue all instances of infringement. Policing your trademark requires resources but in the words of Peterson J., “… what is worth copying is prima facie worth protecting.” (University of London Press v University Tutorial Press[1916] 2 Ch 601).

Name: Subject: Message: Life-like realism, a Pixel AR and going mainstream: catching up with Project Tango Features Newsby Kris Carlon8 hours ago 1 126 10 Project Tango has been around for a while, from the developer tablet and demos at MWC and Google I/O to the Lenovo Phab2 Pro and the new Asus Zenfone AR. While we’ve seen it progress quite steadily in that time, we’ve never seen it look as convincing as it did at I/O this week. With the recent announcement that Verizon will carry the Zenfone AR in the U.S., Tango is about to hit the mainstream. See also: The state of Google’s hardware program 1 week ago From slightly choppy and unstable demos in years past to something that looks completely consumer-ready, Tango has matured a lot in the last year. Tango’s mainstream possibilities have also blossomed, with obscure home renovation and museum guide applications being supplemented by familiar shopping experiences and edutainment possibilities. Once the Zenfone AR hits Verizon, the audience and developer support will take off, even if it is likely to be at a relatively slow pace. But while the Phab2 Pro was a massive tank of a phone with a pretty niche audience, the Zenfone AR is a much more manageable device for the regular joe. Fortunately, there’s already a lot of consumer-level AR experiences available, just waiting for a larger audience to dive in. That’s what Tango’s booth at I/O was all about: showing exactly what the tech is capable of now. Google’s Jared Finder was kind enough to take us through what’s new and where Tango is at right now. There's already a lot of consumer-level AR experiences available, just waiting for a larger audience. The most eye-catching demo at I/O was easily the Wizard of Oz demo, in which you can watch short AR animations of Oz characters overlaid against the real room in which you are standing. You can walk around the characters and see various AR elements interact with the real world (which you can see in the video above) and you can even pose with your favorites. It’s cute, it’s super smooth, and it’s very convincingly done. Cartoon-style graphics are one thing, but in light of the announcement that cinema quality graphics will be coming to Daydream VR courtesy of the Seurat project, I asked Finder if we could expect to see something similar in Tango. Choice is the ultimate goal for Tango: from cartoony graphics to life-like realism. I was told that for the Tango team, choice is the ultimate goal: from cartoony graphics like that in the Oz demo to life-like realism, Tango wants to provide content creators with everything they need to bring their AR vision to life. This is an exciting prospect. Just for a second, try to imagine how incredible real-time AR that’s indistinguishable from reality will be. I also asked if we’d be seeing the Google hardware team adopting Tango tech in future on a Pixel AR phone. Surprisingly enough, I was told that Google is absolutely among the list of third-party OEMs the Tango team is targeting, just like any other manufacturer. Even within Google’s empire there are no free rides, but the big difference is that it is in Google’s own best interest to help push Tango when the time is right. Tango is probably still two or three years away from being ready for a major mainstream push. But the Pixel is very much intended as a mainstream consumer device, and it is definitely still too early for a Tango Pixel. I was told that Tango is probably still two or three years away from being ready for a major mainstream push. With that in mind, it’s a relatively short leap to assume we might see a Pixel AR phone in the next couple of years. After all, if Google itself won’t commit to a Google-branded Tango device, what kind of signal does that send to other OEMs? Perhaps the most impressive indicator of just how far Tango has come in recent months is the app Constructor. Seeing just how quickly the textures of a room can be captured, and how much detail is recorded in such a short amount of time, is very impressive. There’s so much you can do with it too: from mapping your apartment for an Airbnb listing to capturing the interior of a holiday destination to show your friends back home. What we saw in the past felt like a proof-of-concept. What we're seeing today feels ready for prime-time. We’ve seen similar demos like this in the past, but they were patchy, slow, and nowhere near as polished. What we saw in the past felt like a proof-of-concept. What we’re seeing today feels ready for prime-time. It’s still early days for AR, but there’s no denying the tech is ready. As soon as you watch a demo now you start imagining the possibilities. The best thing is that a lot of these apps are already available in Google Play. See also: Google has exciting new plans for Augmented Reality 3 days ago From the GAP app, which lets you “see” and move around items of clothing in three dimensions, to the awesome experiences made possible by Google Expeditions in the classroom, Tango is all grown up. It’ll take a while yet to become truly normalized, but the Tango team ultimately wants to see its tech in all devices. Games like Pokemon Go may have have taken the idea of AR mainstream, but it’ll be custom-built devices that convince regular folks to take the next step.

Glibc / GNU Toolchain Dropping Google NaCl Support Written by Michael Larabel in GNU on 20 May 2017 at 06:12 PM EDT. Add A Comment Support for Google's Native Client (NaCl) has been removed from mainline glibc with the GNU toolchain no longer really being maintained or used for compiling code targeting this Chrome-supported sandboxed code execution environment. NaCl is Google's technology for allowing native code to be executed from a web browser. NaCl hasn't seen too much activity recently and there's been reports that it's not being actively developed in the age of ASM.js and more pressing these days is the cross-browser WebAssembly effort. While for the past two years there has been NaCl support in Glibc, that code is now removed. With the code not being actively maintained and the NaCl GCC code never being contributed to upstream GCC, glibc developers have decided to drop this port. Additionally, the current NaCl SDK makes use of LLVM Clang rather than the GNU toolchain. Thus as of earlier today, the NaCl port is dropped.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices [Update] Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares191 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not. It appears that Pay has been fixed via a server-side update, which is why some people who have had trouble updating their Nexuses can now use the Pay app.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it. Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory and OTA images are now available to download.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? Dn Bro No it's oem unlocking option https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e5b64da4b008176fb08c064f9e16566252aa48001e2ccb59231062d5af2a2dd4.png ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Martial Clausse After a day or two, all the crashes seem to have gone away automagically... It was bad, I couldn't read my emails and so on, but now everything works... So I'll keep this as a daily driver :) Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something.

Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning. The version is the same, but now it's a 1047MB download. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9000c49c9403d0d934b43f20e78a43675548972a522f62b370ca9822f5b69643.png Guilherme Noronha Just installed the 1047MB OTA. It installed successfully and build number went up to .019 OkieDokie Awesome news. My 6P is downloading a much bigger .019 OTA as well, this time it is 1053.3 MB so hopefully this one works like it did for your 5X. satyendra karn It is working now. For my Nexus 6P, Installation​ size got changed from 55 mb to 1053.3 mb for build no .019. Dr Maario For me, the update cost 1053,3MB RobVdm I got the small update yesterday and it didn't install. Just now I received a bigger one (1GB). Hopefully this will fix it. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7aac1aa45ceac04c15cf1394c549307120b4151768e693d068d79f759450192e.png Domingos Ferreira Re appeared for my 6p but the size now if of 1053.3 MB Domingos Ferreira And installed correctly.. but was way too fast to be a 1gb update.. weird Follow Android Police 1.49M 470k 144k 116k Latest Deals 18 [Deal Alert] Here are 12 temporarily free and 6 on-sale apps for your post-I/O weekend 2017/05/19 12:59pm PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Samsung Gear 360 1st gen down to $168.55 on Amazon 2017/05/19 2:06am PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get a UE ROLL 2 Bluetooth speaker in Sugarplum for just $45 ($55 off) on Amazon 2017/05/18 8:12pm PDTMay 18, 2017 1 [Deal Alert] Celebrate the start of Google I/O with 9 temporarily free and 10 on-sale apps, plus both 0.10 Apps of the Week 2017/05/17 9:09am PDTMay 17, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get $50 off the new HTC U11 with promo code 2017/05/17 3:40am PDTMay 17, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Alarm.com releases its actions for Google Assistant, including locking doors and disarming security systems Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/20 5:01am PDTMay 20, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Google News Actions on Google, the platform that makes it possible for third-party developers and services to integrate with Google Assistant, has been seeing a lot of success lately with important companies jumping on board like LG, GE, Logitech, and more. The newest addition though might be one of the most interesting — at least if your name is Artem Russakovskii (all hail our geeky leader!) and you have dozens of lights, locks, sensors, and cameras all working within the Alarm.com system. Alarm.com users will be able to add their system under Google Assistant's Assistant apps section or by saying, "OK Google, talk to Alarm.com." Once authenticated with their credentials, they have a lot of options at their disposal. They can change the thermostat temperature, control individual or grouped lights, lock and unlock doors and garage doors, arm and disarm their security system, and inquire about the state of any lock, light, or thermostat. Given the security concerns over disarming your system or unlocking your doors, Alarm.com provides an optional (which I think should be mandatory) setting for a 4-digit PIN code that you'll have to say to perform these potentially compromising actions. As you can imagine, Artem is ecstatic about the feature — though he would have preferred a direct smart home partner integration with Assistant instead of this third-party solution — especially because the Alexa integration for Alarm.com doesn't offer any unlock or disarm functionality. However, Alarm.com tells us that this will soon be remedied and the options will come to Alexa as well.

I want the Google Assistant to carry out tasks without having me talk to another half-baked 3rd party assistant. This is just as worse as Alexa's "10,000 skills" on the Echo that you have to memorize to use. If I have to talk to another service, I won't use it. Which is why I have never used any of the "talk to blah" third party services on Google Home since launch. Jared Eberle While I completely agree, Google has made this quite usable with shortcuts. I use Autovoice all the time now that there is shortcuts. Taco Monster Yeah, the shortcuts make it work very well. Artem Russakovskii That's true, but it's still better than no integration, and as an alarm.com user, I've been waiting for Assistant to be able to control it for months. jaycemiskel I have an Alexa and alarm.com. You're right that you can't disarm or unlock, but it does have functionality to lock your doors and arm your system. I do it all of the time. The article is somewhat incorrect. I want direct integration though. That ask alarm.com crap is annoying Taco Monster As mentioned above, you can set up shortcuts to make it a bit more palatable. Works well with my August lock. jaycemiskel Thanks. That definitely is helpful. Sucks setting it all up, but it's going to save me a lot of time in the future. Artem Russakovskii Problem is there are no variables supported by shortcuts, so you'd have to program every single device you have and every variant of the command (lock, unlock, turn on, turn off, etc). May be OK for someone with 1-2 devices, but I have dozens, so it wouldn't scale for me. Maybe I'd set it up only for the most commonly used commands, but I'm hoping Google can make shortcuts and NLP in general a lot more powerful. Right now, it's more frustrating than useful. Taco Monster I think you'll forever be an outlier on these things 😉. But yes, if catering to people like you makes the experience better for everyone, then that's obviously a great thing to get behind. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, that part is wrong, I'll get it fixed up. Btw in my tests, surprisingly, Alexa works really well, and Assistant works like absolute crap. jaycemiskel Yeah Alexa works well. I agree, just started using it with assistant today and it seems like it's more finicky than with Alexa. usnmustanger Yeah, I tested this alarm.com assistant for 10 minutes, and 90% of the time the alarm.com assistant couldn't understand what I was saying, asking me to repeat myself. I was able to successfully arm my alarm system exactly once, and was never able to disarm it by voice. Talk about half-baked... Artem Russakovskii I'm talking to Alarm.com PR now, so I'll let them know we're not quite as happy with Assistant integration compared to Alexa. Matt Colontrelle Been holding out on Google home but just installed am alarm.com system might just get one now trying the whole automated route in the house MarcVH So you can do "arm stay" with this but not "arm away". I'm guessing this is a deliberate limitation but I'm not sure I understand why. C Lo My only concern with using a system such as Google Home is the ability of these systems to mistaken someone else's voice for mine. Im glad to see the mistaken voice reducing down to 4.9% however, I'd like to see it as close to zero as possible. Once it gets in the 1% range, I will try it. Artem Russakovskii Why though? Disarming/unlocking is protected by a PIN. As for the 4.9% figure, I am not sure it has anything to do with recognizing an individual voice but rather recognizing what was said correctly. I don't think if you trained your voice for personalized results that it would recognize someone else as you 4.9% of the time...

Here are all the Instant Apps announced at Google I/O Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 2:36pm PDTMay 18, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 133 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares243 Google News Instant apps were announced one year ago at Google I/O 2016, but only now are they rolling out to a large amount of users. Now any developer can make instant apps, and Google showed off a massive list of them at a session earlier today (seen above). Some of the highlights include Vimeo for watching videos, Jet for shopping, Periscope for watching live streams, The Weather Channel, and even the New York Times crossword puzzle. Most of these already have mobile web app versions, but the point is that Instant Apps provide a native application experience. Even though the Instant Apps feature is already rolled out to me, I'm unable to use some of these, perhaps indicating that some are still in testing. For example, I couldn't get the Weather Channel or Periscope ones to work, but Vimeo and Jet did. Instant apps currently work on Android 6.0 or higher.

If you were already using them, you'd have them installed and have no need for an instant app. Shazmil Nassar Well if you're using it you won't get the instant app at all when you search. . . boop I've yet to figure out how instant apps work. DieselBeats Basically the experience of the app without having to download it. It's moreso if you are really only going to use the app once so it's not just hogging up space on your phone and never being used. boop I now that much. I mean I've never been able to pull one up. Sruly J Do you have the Google Play Services for Instant Apps app installed? Michel S. weird, why can't I find that in the Play Store? (on Android O beta, en-US) Sruly J It's not available through the Play Store. Officially the app is supposed to roll out to devices in the background, with the same going for updates. It's available on APK Mirror though. Richard Riker in theory you should get a button when you google for the app. But it may be US only at the moment, having the location set to en-us doesn't help. And at least in the show-off at last years I/O you should have such a button in the play store too. But you'll have to have Play Services for Instant apps and activate them in the play services settings antonio cesar you must have a specific google play services called google play services for instant apps, it dosent come preloaded David Onter It downloads native mini-apps in the background and displays them to you instead of the website when you click on a link. Jpx I remember when I was sent a zillow link from my girlfriend last month. It used instant apps and I freaked out. I was rambling to her like she had any idea what I was talking about. It is such a great feature, that really doesn't feel like a big deal. Which means its amazing. Sir_Brizz "amoutsn" Carson Saldanha "amountsn fo" Sir_Brizz LOL Total Insecurity XDD Total Insecurity XD Carson Saldanha I have instant apps enabled, but they don't show up in search results. (I'm on Google US btw) Renaud Lepage What the HELL is the CBC in there for? abqnm So if you're searching for something and the result points to the CBC, you get the instant app for CBC. Not only Canadians get news from the CBC. Say, for example if you're from the US, you probably won't have the app installed, but you may get a CBC news story or such in your search results, so by providing an instant app, the user gets mostly the same experience as they would if they had the app installed. Renaud Lepage I know the why, I'm Canadian. I'm just surprised they actually gave enough of a shit to do an Instant App. abqnm Alright, point. But it's not like the instant apps are hard if you already have an app. I guess maybe they are focusing on engagement in search more now. That's really what these are. skillfulshoe I keep catching my phone "downloading" an update but it is for instant apps and the notification disappears within a second. Anyone know what is happening? Corbin Davenport That's the support library/APK for instant apps updating. skillfulshoe I've seen it do that about 5 times in the past few days. Anyways, thanks for the answer! Mike in KC I've noticed the same thing on my phone as well. Ozl Awesome, i cant wait to ditch my iPhone for a new Pixel 2.0 whenever they are available xD Jack Smith Two of us. Looking forward to getting a Pixel 2. Just hope I can get my hands on one. Ozl Yes, ill be there waiting to click that buy button on day one xD mehmehmeh I have noticed that since I switched back from iPhone to the S8+ that app updates seem smaller. Did they change how apps are updated in the 6ish months I was away from Android? iFeign Delta updates http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/07/23/new-play-store-tools-help-developers-to-shrink-the-size-of-app-updates/ patkoscsaba So. I have Google Play services for Instant Apps installed. I am also a beta user for Google App. How do I get an instant app? Can someone provide a step by step example with a an existing app? iAndroHacker Mine installed instant-apps services for a month ago but how do i use it? Nate Harris Pretty sure Instant Apps are supposed to work all the way back to KitKat. They specifically demoed it on KitKat at last year's I/O BlackeyeX2 Better yet, post links for each one so we can try it out...

On May 11, 1997, IBM's computer Deep Blue beat the reigning world chess champion Gary Kasparov in a series of six real-life matches. That was the first time a machine, inflexible and non-intuitive as it was, outplayed a human being. Then in March last year , the computer AlphaGo - developed by Google Deep Mind - defeated Mr Lee Sedol, an 18-time world champion at the complex board game Go. Are robots now closer to being on a par with people? What would it be like to live in such a world, and lead companies and countries alongside machines? How might morals change? To answer these questions, United States-born Catholic priest Philip Larrey interviewed those at the forefront of shaping the future, including Mr Eric Schmidt, who is executive chairman of Google's parent company Alphabet; Mr Martin Sorrell, group chairman of the world's largest advertising group WPP; and researcher Anders Sandberg, from Oxford University's Future of Humanity Institute. Get The Straits Times newsletters in your inbox Sign Up Professor Larrey teaches philosophy at the Vatican's Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, where he holds the chair of logic. Connected World is the follow-up to his 2014 book Futuro Ignoto, or Unknown Future, in Italian. EIGHT KEY TAKEAWAYS 1 In the future, workers will be monitored and kept on track by all-seeing systems, not people. 2 With many people used to absorbing data in 140 characters a tweet, they are losing the ability to think critically. If this continues, future generations will just swallow wholesale whatever they are told. 3 Technocrats like life to be precise, repetitive and decisive, and so, see those who are imaginative, creative and flexible as "distracting". This attitude has to stop if people are to be valued more than machines. 4 Many people will have artificial organs, or new types of DNA put in them. Already, there is talk of implanting a chip in your hand to turn it into a cellphone. All this will change the way people think and act. 5 With 3D printing enabling us to make things on the spot, and with a growing interest in collaborations, there will be a return to, and renewed respect for, craftsmanship. 6 Deft and adept communicators will be in greatest demand, especially those who respond promptly to clients. 7 With many corporations going global, they no longer answer to single-country governments. So, governments will team up and form alliances to negotiate deals and provide services, in place of sovereign countries. 8 Many people uphold rules, systems and processes but ignore the flouting of principles of decency. But in future, honouring principles will matter more than just going by the rules.

The new program, called Android Go, was announced at the Alphabet Inc. division’s I/O developer conference on Wednesday in Mountain View, California. It bakes features directly into Google’s mobile operating system that are designed specifically for cheap phones, including software to manage cellular data costs. The service will launch in 2018. Google releases a new Android operating system every year, but most devices running the software use older versions. These phones do not get as frequent security and feature updates, a persistent problem for the company.  India has more active Android users than the U.S., Sameer Samat, a Google executive, said on stage on Wednesday. But in countries like this, the high cost of mobile data is a major barrier to consumers buying smartphones and using Google services.  Android Go has a feature that more easily tracks mobile data usage and ties automatically with the billing systems of wireless carriers, Samat said. Google also designed the service to minimize data usage on bandwidth-hungry services like YouTube. Previously, Google tried to solve this low-end phone issue with a program called Android One. The service was designed to tailor the latest Android operating system for phones costing around $100 or less. However, it failed to take off in key markets, like India, because the companies that manufactured the devices couldn’t make much money just selling the hardware. In an interview, Samat said that the Android One program is continuing, although it dropped the earlier effort to work with phones at the $100 price point. Less Data Usage Android Go will only be available on phones that run Google’s upcoming software version, available next year. So far, most manufacturers have avoided shipping the latest Android on cheap phones to save costs. But Samat said the changes coming with Android Go will convince the hardware partners to change course. The new software is designed to run versions of Google apps that require less data. Samat mentioned YouTube as one app, but declined to name others. Google will also be curating a list of apps in its digital store that are designed for light data usage. "That’s a selling proposition that people can get excited about," Samat said. Facebook Inc. tried a similar app-curation strategy -- picking a suite of services to "zero-rate," or subsidize the data charge. That effort fell flat after considerable pushback in countries like India. Samat said Google isn’t using zero-rating in its initial Android Go version. On stage, Samat demonstrated a novel way for Android users to track their mobile data usage and even pay their monthly or pre-paid mobile-phone bills via Google Play. Google has set up carrier billing options in its Play store in 55 countries with 140 telecom partners. The company doesn’t disclose its Play store sales. Samat declined to share any carrier or manufacturing partners Google has with Android Go. Print reprints Favorite EMAIL Tweet Discuss this Article 2 obarthelemy on May 19, 2017 Reviving ? They're thriving. I'd say "decrapifying" instead, because phone below $100 are mostly crap right now (but not above that: Xiaomi's $120 Redmi 4 is Good Enough for most) Login or register to post comments SamR on May 19, 2017 It is no better for Google's own phones. Google throws you under a bus after as little as 2-3 years, no more OS or even security updates. This is completely untenable now that Google's phones compete directly with iPhones on price. In fact many iPhones are cheaper now than Google phones. I used to own a Nexus, there is no way I would then buy an expensive Pixel to replace it after how I was treated with my first Google phone. Google now has premium pricing with mediocre support. Login or register to post comments Please Log In or Register to post comments.

I have two Google Homes and I can't wait to take advantage of some of these new features. Lars Jeppesen I am contemplating buying a tv (haven't had one for years) just to use some of the new cool visual features of Home (I have 3 of them). Any recommendations for someone who wants to use it as a casting device and doesn't need a tv tuner (or crappy smart tv features).. just a very good 4k panel without any fuss? James Bryant Hisense make tvs that are considered some of the best you can get for the money. Generally quite affordable too. I believe it's the 7000 series. Lars Jeppesen Thanks, will have a look jonzey231 I got a 55" Vizio E Series on Black Friday with Chromecast Built-In. It's 4K, no HDR, though. There's no tuner so I did have to buy an external one, but that was a blessing in disguise because now I have it running into my TV via HDMI which I like. Got it for like $350-$400ish. Picture is fantastic, especially for what I paid. And I love that even if the TV is off (standby mode), I can just cast something from my phone and it turns the TV on and just starts playing. It's small, but it's convenient. Plus, casting is even in 4K if you're using Netlfix or whatever else with the 4K subscription. Lars Jeppesen Thanks. Is that the tv one of the "all about android" show cast got as well? He likes it a lot. I prefer without a tv tuner as I cut tv signal years ago. Drakenoid That's your best option imo, it works really well. Lars Jeppesen F*uck .. Vizio only sells in the US.. I'm european.. dammit dammit dammit I was getting fired up :) abc Me too. I'll probably pick one up in two to three years when it comes out of beta. Rik Wall The GBoard auto translate feature blew me away personally. Evgany It's been available in beta for months. Rik Wall I think I need to join the beta LOL OrionBeast begs a question, how do you join a beta? (for iOS?). joke: buy android phone. pls. don't downvote <3 Daniel I'M DOWNVOTING RIGHT NOW! JK Pls don't downvote me. Serge Cebrian Downvoting ... Plz dont Downv..... Nah I don't care downvote me into oblivion Just kidding Don't downvote me Drakenoid It's not just in beta. Тарас Мукин It's not an auto-translate, I believe you mixed up 2 different things in one. If you want to translate -- write actual words in one language and get words in other-- you have to press "translate" and type into field inside keyboard -- translated words will appear in main field. But what happens automathicaly is phonetic input -- you write hindi words using english letters, basically transcription. It has to be specific phonetic keyboard layout. The same thing is used in Japanese input for a long time already, as long as their alphabet (kana) is too big to fit in QWERTY-like layout. Paul_Werner Do you know how to have this working now in GBoard? I don't know if it's possible but it'd be nice to test out the transcription feature. I am already on beta and have the translation feature Drakenoid Go into gboard settings>languages you'll find the options there, it should be obvious there. OrionBeast It's good to see Google integrating their services quite nicely. Especially with all the AI features coming along quite well.

NO MATERIAL DESIGN WEB CALENDAR? Daniel That's happening in Q4 JG When they were talking about Android Go and she said something along the lines of "While Google Go-ifies our apps, we're opening it up to you, the developers to" I had to laugh... Google has been stressing Material Design as a unified design scheme for how many years now, and they still haven't managed to implement it across all of their properties yet... And that's basically just cosmetic changes. Making a Go app should require a little more work re-designing the app to use less bandwidth and local storage etc. [* and considering how well Allo turned out as a re-design of Hangouts ... but that's another story] Raviteja Rachuri The google lens and Suggested sharing are the things that caught my attention the most. Looking forward for using them. Hope they launch 'Google Home' in India. Bankyy Pakorn so nothing exciting..feels like android has been stagnant in its innovation department for years now.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Samsung’s 2017 smartphone champ, the Galaxy S8, has finally landed. This time around, it’s not just a new and improved mobile experience that the Korean giant has to deliver but an assurance its investment will be safe and reliable. Last year’s Galaxy Note 7 was the pinnacle of the company’s smartphone development, which unfortunately ended in a fiery disaster due to poorly designed batteries. Apologetic and persistent, Samsung is forcefully moving past the debacle with an extra robust QA process and its boldest smartphone design update ever. Not only does the Galaxy S8 maintain the Note 7’s symmetrically curved glass design, but it trades bezel for screen real estate – resulting in a sizable 5.8″ display that you can use with one hand. This may be the most striking smartphone ever made, but is it any good? Find out in our Samsung Galaxy S8 Smartphone Review! Overview Price: $799 on Amazon unlocked or $31.50/month on Verizon Available: Apr. 2017 Model: Galaxy S8 Summary: The Galaxy S8 is Samsung’s newest flagship smartphone update, following the ill-fated Note 7 some months ago. It brings back the Note 7’s symmetrically and subtly curved design, while pushing the envelope even further with a near bezel-free display. Every aspect of last year’s Galaxy S7 receives a boost, but it’s not without a couple questionable decisions. What We Liked Almost bezel-less design Best display quality on a smartphone Lightning fast and high quality camera Awesome battery life Useful software features What We Didn’t Slippery and fragile exterior Terrible fingerprint scanner placement Bixby assistant is very limited Expensive Galaxy S8 Specs Display 5.8" (18.5:9 aspect ratio), Super-AMOLED, QHD resolution (2,960x1,440) Chipset Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 (octa-core, 2.35 GHz, Adreno 540 GPU) Memory 4GB of RAM Storage 64GB internal and up to 256GB microSD expansion Rear Camera 12MP Dual Pixel, f/1.7 aperture, 1.4µm pixels, OIS Front Camera 8MP, f/1.7 aperture Battery 3,000 mAh (non-removeable) Software Android 7.0 (Nougat) with Samsung Experience user interface Colors Midnight Black, Arctic Silver, Orchid Gray Price $756 Buy Now Design If you’ve seen a Galaxy smartphone before, the first thing you’ll notice about the Galaxy S8 is that it doesn’t quite look like any of its older brothers or sisters. Since the beginning, the front of every Samsung device consisted of a Home button, sandwiched in between capacitive navigation buttons. On Samsung’s newest iteration of their brand-defining flagship phone, you’ll now be looking at a full, uninterrupted black panel. The Always-On Display returns on the Galaxy S8, along with plentiful customization and interactive icons with full third-party support. Underneath the new on-screen Home button is a pressure-sensitive area that wakes the phone with a firm press. Yes, Samsung has finally embraced on-screens buttons, which Google introduced all the way back on the Galaxy Nexus in 2011. But there’s more to the move than just delayed conformance; it helps the cause of Samsung’s design progression. Bezel reduction and increased screen real estate is the realized trend in 2017, as also seen with the LG G6. To achieve that, the physical navigation buttons had to hit the road too. The Galaxy S8’s exterior is a refinement of the past, but in a taller footprint. This enables it to have more screen while maintaining one-handed usability. What we gain is a super clean and symmetric presentation. And being that Samsung has now fully invested in its dual-edge curved screen aesthetic, the almost bezelless design looks more futuristic than ever. In our eyes, this is the most beautiful phone yet (at least with respect to simplicity and refinement), and one that will be difficult to top by competitors. Just like we adored on the Note 7, the front and back glass panels symmetrically curve (seemingly melting) into the metal frame, which now matches the glass’ luxurious shine with a glossy finish instead of matte like on previous devices. The rounded-corner display swoops down to the curved edges for a more natural effect. Both front and back glass panels curve symmetrically into the metal frame. We still see plastic antennas lined into the metal and the typical array of components along the bottom. Past these cosmetic tweaks, we are looking at a very familiar layout. The bottom still crowds the 3.5mm headphone jack, charging port (USB Type-C), microphone, and mono speaker, while the top cleanly stows away the SIM/microSD card tray. Power and volume button arrangements also remain unchanged. There is however an addition – a dedicated button underneath the volume rocker that triggers Samsung’s new Bixby software assistant (we’ll cover its function later in the review). All of this is sealed up in a waterproof package that can hold up to an IP68 ingress rating (up to 5 feet of water for 30 minutes). The camera lens is finally completely flush with the rear glass panel. The fingerprint sensor lies unusually adjacent to the camera – an unfortunate result of increasing the screen area on the front. Samsung has no doubt done a stellar job refining every angle of the Galaxy S series, but that doesn’t mean that it’s faultless. The elimination of the physical home button on the front meant putting the fingerprint scanner on the back. This is in no way unusual these days, as some of the competition has already done so (i.e. LG G6 or Google Pixel), but Samsung opted for a non-ergonomic location that’s right next to the camera lens. It’s a chore to reach (causing a lot of scanner misses) and increases the potential of finger smudges clouding up pictures. And even though both glass panels are Gorilla Glass 5 reinforced, there is still a great risk of scratches/cracks. All it takes is the right wrong drop. This isn’t helped by the glass’ slippery nature and the tapered grip on the sides. Most users will feel the need to protect the phone with a robust case, which defeats the purpose of such a gorgeous design. Performance The Galaxy S8’s battery consistently got us over a day’s use. This graph is an example of moderate-to-high use on Verizon and WiFi networks (Auto Brightness setting), which achieved 5 hours of screen-on-time. We also had great battery conservation on idle. One of the Galaxy S8’s biggest selling points is its cutting edge chipset. This is the first smartphone to hit the streets with Qualcomm’s most advanced mobile System-on-a-Chip (SoC) achievement, the Snapdragon 835. The chip maker in fact partnered with Samsung to bring this 10nm processor to fruition, leading to octa-core power and never before seen battery efficiency. Not to mention other big moves forward like Bluetooth v5.0 (which lets you wirelessly stream an audio signal to two headsets at the same time), high-quality Qualcomm Aqstic audio playback, and the ability of Gigabit LTE and WiFi speeds. Suffice to say, the Galaxy S8 flies through every action/task effortlessly. It’s a pleasure how quickly and fluidly the software responds to your presses, and it hasn’t let up at any point throughout our use. With that said, the Google Pixel still holds the crown as far as consistency goes. Despite the powerhouse hardware, minor occasional stutters do still unfortunately occur with Samsung’s software. Base storage still offers a plentiful 64GB capacity, like on last year’s models, and microSD expandability up to 256GB. We also see the same 3,000 mAh battery capacity as the Galaxy S7 (supported with Quick Charge and wireless charging). It’s typical to get a battery bump at each refresh, but we’re guessing that Samsung wants to be exceedingly careful this time around. Fortunately, this happens to be of no consequence in real-world use. We don’t know if it’s due to the extra battery efficiency of the chipset or new software (or both), but we observed some of the best battery life results we’ve seen on a smartphone. Display The star of the S8’s show is clearly that commanding 5.8″ curved display. Minimal bezel means there’s little to distract from the elongated (18.5:9 aspect ratio) screen; and what bezel does remain is colored black to make the front look like a uniform, clean glass panel. Using the device feels like you’re just holding a screen – a perception further propelled by how the edges of images flow down the sides, like an infinity pool. The Galaxy S8’s brilliant and bright display takes up a whooping 83% of the front panel. And since this is Samsung display that we’re talking about, it equates to a glorious eyeful. The company’s home-brewed Super-AMOLED panels are arguably the best in the industry, in all terms of quality: color accuracy, vividness, viewing angles, and brightness. Colors pop but aren’t overdone, and the crisp picture is maintained at even the most extreme viewing angle. It’s neither phased by sunlight. Even though the display can go over 1,000 nits of brightness, we found that about 60% was enough for use on a sunny day. It’s important to note that the S8 is set at 1080P resolution out of the box. We assume that Samsung did this to put less strain on battery. That said, in our eyes there’s negligible consequence in sharpness, at least on this smaller variant of the S8 series (there’s also a 6.2″ Galaxy S8+ model). But if the user is unconvinced, the native QHD+ resolution (2,960 x 1,440 pixels) can be set from within the Display settings. Camera Samsung’s camera interface remains mostly the same, with the addition of a zoom slider built into the stutter button and the Bixby Vision button on the bottom right (detects and web searches your image). Judging by the camera specs alone, it appears that Samsung merely carried over the same rear camera sensor from last year’s Galaxy S7: 12MP capture resolution, f/1.7 aperture lens, 1.4µm pixel size, and speedy Dual Pixel auto-focus technology. But it’s not completely true. It is in fact a newer module from Sony, the IMX 333, as opposed to the IMX 260 in the Galaxy S7 (same story for models that happen to use ISOCELL sensors from Samsung). It’s still certainly an incremental update, and Samsung is primarily touting its software effort that improves the consistency of quality shots. There is now enhanced image processing in place that captures multiple shots at once to come up with the clearest image. Swiping from left to right on the camera interface brings up Samsung’s various shooting modes. In real world use, the auto-focus was as speedy as we remembered from the Galaxy S7, and we don’t recall getting a bad shot. The focal point of close subjects is spot-on (with perfect blurring in the background), and landscape shots are vivid and detailed. High Dynamic Range (HDR) situations are handled well, but sometimes we felt we could’ve used more detail in the darker areas. Captures tend to lean on the brighter side – something that’s really beneficial when the light fades. Check out some of our favorites sample shots below. Software Like the hardware, the user interface (UI) on the Galaxy S8 has also undergone some serious revamping. That’s even suggested by the retirement of Samsung’s infamous TouchWiz alias to now a more straightforward Samsung Experience. With Android 7.0 (Nougat), the company is finally attempting to work with Google’s software as opposed to fighting it at every turn. This mean that we get modern gestures like swiping up/down on the screen to open the app drawer, a customizable quick settings menu, dual-window apps launcher by holding the Recents button, and Google Assistant by long-pressing the Home button. Home screen of the Galaxy S8. The quick settings in the notification shade is arrange-able. There is no longer the need for an app drawer button – just swipe up or down to open/close it. Frankly, this is maturity that we’ve been waiting forever for Samsung to achieve. Too long has bubbly/cartoon-y styling been imposed on us. Fonts, icons, and buttons are now cohesively clean, modern, and chic – from the lock screen to the camera app. It’s pleasantly refreshing to see software that’s as classy as the hardware that surrounds it, which brings the whole phone’s package together like never before. Samsung of course wouldn’t dare forgo its stockpile of extra features accumulated over the years, such as the ability to pop out an app as a floating window, theming, audio upscaling, Always-On Display layout customization, Edge screen shortcuts (menu from swiping from the very edge), and even the GIF creator from the Note 7. The magnitude of options in the Settings menu can be overwhelming (we suggest to use the search function if you can’t find what you’re looking for), but that also means flexibility and customization to your heart’s desire. Split-screen dual app view makes a return, but with extra Samsung functionality. Snap Window lets you highlight the content/window size and snap it to the top, and Pop-up View lets you turn the app into a floating window. The Edge Screen feature returns with various Edge Panel shortcuts with a swipe from the edge, such as favorite apps/contacts, smart select functions, news, reminders, tasks, calendar events. Samsung provides some customization of the on-screen button layout, including switching the Recent and Back button order. You can also tailor the sensitivity of the pressure sensor for the Home button. There are some newcomers, due to the physical changes that the Galaxy S8 has undergone. Now that the physical navigation buttons are gone, the on-screen buttons open up other venue of options. For instance, you can swap the order of the Back and Recents buttons and change the color of that dedicated area. The pressure sensitivity of the Home button can be adjusted, and can be set to unlock the phone with a hard press (bypassing the lock screen). With regards to the expanded 18.5:9 aspect ratio, unfortunately not every app will automatically stretch to fill the space. Like LG on the 18:9 G6, Samsung threw in a Full Screen Apps settings in which you specify which apps will scale or remain at their native 16:9 format. Just bear in mind that until media creators adopt the new dimensions, videos and games will have to crop to fit. Native media will display letterboxing (black vertical bars on either side). Where the advantage of the taller displays is seen is with informational apps (browser, social media, news, etc.). You get more content on the screen and have to scroll less. The Bixby panel uses a scrollable, card-like layout, very similar to how the Google App functions. You can control what content is displayed in the Bixby panel. However, it’s very limited to Samsung’s own apps. Bixby Vision lets the user quickly web query a camera image. Samsung is making a big push on its own smart assistant software known as Bixby. The problem is that it’s not yet fully developed, even with its launch on the S8. For instance, Bixby voice control is still on Samsung’s to-do list (at the time of this writing), which is a huge part of any smart assistant (i.e. Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri). The benefit of Bixby right now is as a nice aggregator of information you want on the left-most panel of your phone. You can pin content that matter most to you, but from limited third-party sources at the moment (i.e. Facebook, Foursquare, Linkedin, Twitter, CNN). This also means that you won’t get Bixby card support from any Google app which Samsung has its own app for (calendar, email, photo gallery, music, etc.). Final Thoughts With the Galaxy S8, we’d say that Samsung solidly succeeded to deliver a knockout device that overshadows the tremendous misfortune of the Note 7. Since the introduction of this metal and glass construction on the Galaxy S6, each iteration has inched closer to a perfected design, and the Galaxy S8 has taken the biggest step thus far. The outside is a culminated refinement of symmetry, construction, and elegance, while the inside is a powerhouse of processing power, battery longevity, unrivaled screen quality, quick and reliable camera capture, and competent and classy software. But it’s not perfect yet; covering a large phone in curved glass is terrible for durability, and the inconceivable fingerprint scanner placement is a big step backwards. Other than that small complaint though, this is simply the most gorgeously designed smartphone you can buy today.

Alarm.com releases its actions for Google Assistant, including locking doors and disarming security systems Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/20 5:01am PDTMay 20, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Google News Actions on Google, the platform that makes it possible for third-party developers and services to integrate with Google Assistant, has been seeing a lot of success lately with important companies jumping on board like LG, GE, Logitech, and more. The newest addition though might be one of the most interesting — at least if your name is Artem Russakovskii (all hail our geeky leader!) and you have dozens of lights, locks, sensors, and cameras all working within the Alarm.com system. Alarm.com users will be able to add their system under Google Assistant's Assistant apps section or by saying, "OK Google, talk to Alarm.com." Once authenticated with their credentials, they have a lot of options at their disposal. They can change the thermostat temperature, control individual or grouped lights, lock and unlock doors and garage doors, arm and disarm their security system, and inquire about the state of any lock, light, or thermostat. Given the security concerns over disarming your system or unlocking your doors, Alarm.com provides an optional (which I think should be mandatory) setting for a 4-digit PIN code that you'll have to say to perform these potentially compromising actions. As you can imagine, Artem is ecstatic about the feature — though he would have preferred a direct smart home partner integration with Assistant instead of this third-party solution — especially because the Alexa integration for Alarm.com doesn't offer any unlock or disarm functionality. However, Alarm.com tells us that this will soon be remedied and the options will come to Alexa as well.

I want the Google Assistant to carry out tasks without having me talk to another half-baked 3rd party assistant. This is just as worse as Alexa's "10,000 skills" on the Echo that you have to memorize to use. If I have to talk to another service, I won't use it. Which is why I have never used any of the "talk to blah" third party services on Google Home since launch. Jared Eberle While I completely agree, Google has made this quite usable with shortcuts. I use Autovoice all the time now that there is shortcuts. Taco Monster Yeah, the shortcuts make it work very well. Artem Russakovskii That's true, but it's still better than no integration, and as an alarm.com user, I've been waiting for Assistant to be able to control it for months. jaycemiskel I have an Alexa and alarm.com. You're right that you can't disarm or unlock, but it does have functionality to lock your doors and arm your system. I do it all of the time. The article is somewhat incorrect. I want direct integration though. That ask alarm.com crap is annoying Taco Monster As mentioned above, you can set up shortcuts to make it a bit more palatable. Works well with my August lock. jaycemiskel Thanks. That definitely is helpful. Sucks setting it all up, but it's going to save me a lot of time in the future. Artem Russakovskii Problem is there are no variables supported by shortcuts, so you'd have to program every single device you have and every variant of the command (lock, unlock, turn on, turn off, etc). May be OK for someone with 1-2 devices, but I have dozens, so it wouldn't scale for me. Maybe I'd set it up only for the most commonly used commands, but I'm hoping Google can make shortcuts and NLP in general a lot more powerful. Right now, it's more frustrating than useful. Taco Monster I think you'll forever be an outlier on these things 😉. But yes, if catering to people like you makes the experience better for everyone, then that's obviously a great thing to get behind. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, that part is wrong, I'll get it fixed up. Btw in my tests, surprisingly, Alexa works really well, and Assistant works like absolute crap. jaycemiskel Yeah Alexa works well. I agree, just started using it with assistant today and it seems like it's more finicky than with Alexa. usnmustanger Yeah, I tested this alarm.com assistant for 10 minutes, and 90% of the time the alarm.com assistant couldn't understand what I was saying, asking me to repeat myself. I was able to successfully arm my alarm system exactly once, and was never able to disarm it by voice. Talk about half-baked... Artem Russakovskii I'm talking to Alarm.com PR now, so I'll let them know we're not quite as happy with Assistant integration compared to Alexa. Matt Colontrelle Been holding out on Google home but just installed am alarm.com system might just get one now trying the whole automated route in the house MarcVH So you can do "arm stay" with this but not "arm away". I'm guessing this is a deliberate limitation but I'm not sure I understand why. C Lo My only concern with using a system such as Google Home is the ability of these systems to mistaken someone else's voice for mine. Im glad to see the mistaken voice reducing down to 4.9% however, I'd like to see it as close to zero as possible. Once it gets in the 1% range, I will try it. Artem Russakovskii Why though? Disarming/unlocking is protected by a PIN. As for the 4.9% figure, I am not sure it has anything to do with recognizing an individual voice but rather recognizing what was said correctly. I don't think if you trained your voice for personalized results that it would recognize someone else as you 4.9% of the time...

Since the announcement, there has been a lot of confusion regarding the project - is it a new version of Android? Can Android Go devices run all Android apps, or only the apps that have been optimised for the Go experience? How will this impact OS updates for consumers, and what will developers need to do differently to optimise their apps for Android Go? Unfortunately, in the immediate aftermath of the keynote, Google didn’t provide answers to a lot of these questions, and there isn’t a lot of information related to Android Go up on Google’s websites either. Thankfully, to answer all these queries - and a whole lot more - we managed to get some time with Sameer Samat, the man who introduced Android Go on stage on Wednesday, and the VP of Product Management for Android and Google Play. Here’s a FAQ on Android Go based on the answers Gadgets 360 got from Samat and other Google executives here in Mountain View. Is Android Go a new version of Android? Samat couldn’t be clearer on this: “Android Go is not a new version of Android, it’s not a different Android, it’s a project name inside Google.” What will be the Android version that Go devices will ship with? “We call it Android Go - it’s an internal name - but the OS that these partners will be shipping will be Android O - there’s no separate OS called Android Go,” Samat explains, just to drive home the point. So what will be different about Android Go devices? Think of Android Go as a bunch of presets that your Android O device will ship with. Some OS settings will be switched on (or off) by default; some Google apps will be a bit different than other Android O devices; and the Google Play Store will highlight third-party apps optimised for the Go experience - that’s about it. “The way this works is that Android has a configuration when you build a device in factory and we are effectively putting a Go configuration in place, which is very similar to what do with Svelte so if the device is low-RAM, for example, when the device is built in the factory, it's configured, right,” Samat explains. “It's not something the user decides, it's something that the OEM decides at the factory and what we are saying is if you are gonna build a device that’s 1GB or less [RAM] then you should build it with the Go OS configuration, so you should use Android O, but you should use these configuration settings.” When asked to detail some of these changes, Samat says, “[..] when in Svelte, as far back as KitKat, there’s a number of things that the device will do to optimise the UI, so when it detects that it's low RAM device, there’s a number of animations that are turned off, a number of things that are memory-intensive like that in the UI that are nice, but if they are done wrong - because they are memory-intensive - they can actually compromise the experience, as opposed to enhancing the experience, so those are some examples of optimisations.” “The other thing though is there are some feature that we are adding, so it's not just about taking away but about adding features. We mentioned yesterday in the keynote that data management is very important to users that are coming online today. So data management will go in Quick Settings as another example of the UI change. So there are some things that are added and some things that are modified.” Google Assistant Comes to iPhone, Understands Typing, and More The three cornerstones of Android Go Samat touched upon these points in his keynote on Wednesday, and he reiterates that Android Go “stands for three things - first, is continuing to optimise the Android operating system to run smoothly on entry-level devices, starting with Android O.” “Second, is making sure that Google apps that we load on these devices are also optimised, which means that we are rebuilding many of the Google apps. I showed in the keynote yesterday - YouTube Go, which is a new app entirely, which is much smaller in APK size, it uses less data, and gives users much more control over data and how they use it, which is very important” “And then finally, it’s not just the Google apps, but also we have many developers that make apps, so we are optimising the Play Store to highlight the apps that are tuned to the needs of users that are coming online for the first time.” Will Android Go device only be able to run apps optimised for the Go experience? Will the Google Play Store on Android Go devices only feature these apps? All Android apps that run on any ‘regular’ Android O device will also run on Android Go devices, barring of course any apps that may not be compatible with your hardware or not available in your region, something that’s the case even today with Android N (or earlier). “The Play Store on Go devices will contain the whole app catalog - no restrictions, unless the developer has a restriction, but the developer can do that today anyway, but no restrictions from Google on the apps,” Samat told Gadgets 360. In other words, the Google Play Store on Android Go devices will include all Android apps, not just apps optimised for Android Go devices. The latter will, however, be highlighted by Google prominently within the Play Store on Go devices, which might make it worth the developers’ time to optimise their apps if they want to target this audience. What about Google apps that ship by default on Android Go devices? In some cases, Google is developing an entirely new app optimised for Android Go devices. As demoed during the keynote, YouTube is one such example, and the YouTube Go app is now available via the Play Store for all devices (not just Android Go phones, see next question) to download and try out. This is the app that will ship by default on Android Go devices, instead of the ‘main’ YouTube app. Certain other apps, like Google Chrome, will just have a different configuration - but are still inherently the same app - and, indeed, other apps may be identical to their Android O counterparts in all ways. For apps like Chrome, the settings will not be locked to the defaults, and users will be free to change the behaviour to be more like on Android O. “For example Chrome has a feature called Data Saver, that will be turned on by default. Users can turn it off if they want, but it will be on by default,” says Samat. “On the other hand YouTube [for Go devices] is a new app, and YouTube Go has the features that the main YouTube app doesn't have. For example showing you the amount of data each video will take when you play. So some apps will be completely new and some apps will be loaded with a different configuration.” Gmail Gets Smart Reply Feature on Android, iOS Can Android Go devices install the ‘regular’ versions of their default apps? In a word - yes. In more than one word - Searching for YouTube on Google Play Store on Android Go devices will show the ‘regular’ YouTube app as well, and users will be free to install this app on their phone. How many users will actually do something like this when they already have a YouTube app on their phone is debatable, and most Go users - supposed first-time smartphone owners - are likely to go through the lifetime of the device without discovering the ‘main’ app. Now in the case of YouTube, specifically, the Go app looks pretty useful with features that the main app itself doesn’t have. But this lack of discoverability of the main app - to reiterate, why will a regular user search for YouTube in Play Store when the phone already has YouTube (Go) installed - might prove to be a problem in the future if, say, it gets a cool new feature before the Go app. Now just to be clear, there are no signs from Google that this will happen in the future, but with two different apps, it’s not entirely inconceivable. Can ‘regular’ Android devices run apps optimised for Android Go? Absolutely. While these apps are optimised for entry-level Android Go devices, there’s nothing stopping your Google Pixel XL or Samsung Galaxy S8, for example, from downloading and running, say, the YouTube Go app. These apps will also show up like any other app when you search for something via the Play Store on your device. How does Android Go differ from Android One? Let’s hear it from the man himself. “Android One was a specific project that focused on three things - first, specifying hardware [..] and we worked with manufactures to do that,” says Samat. “The second was any device that has the Android One brand would have the Google UI, unmodified by the partner. And the third piece was a commitment from the device manufacturer to have regular security updates.” “What we found over time is that a lot of the Android One proposition resonated with users. For example, there are a set of users who want the Google UI, and there were a set of users who wanted regular security updates, but that wasn’t just at the entry-level [as originally intended by the Android One program]. That was at the entry-level, the mid-tier, and the high-end.” “So Android One as a programme has evolved. We recommend hardware, but we no longer require certain hardware from OEMs, and we don’t focus on just the entry-level anymore either. For example, in Turkey we work with General Mobile, and they have a $200-$250 device. In Japan, Sharp and Qyocera, they have devices from $400 to $500. But they make a commitment to use the Google UI, and they make a commitment to do regular updates. So the Android One programme has evolved, and we are quite happy with how that’s evolving.” “And Android Go, again, is not a new version of Android, it’s a project name, and it’s focussed on the three things I mentioned before - optimising Android O, optimising the Google apps, and highlighting apps from the third-party ecosystem in the Play Store, and that’s how they [Android Go and Android One] are a little bit different.” Google Lens Visual Search Service Unveiled Will we see Android Go reference hardware? No such plans at the moment. Samat says Google thinks that “innovation coming from a lot of the hardware partners in different markets and globally is very strong right now in the entry-level [segment]”, and Google’s role will be limited to supporting the software side of things, in terms of making sure the OS is optimised so that OEMs “can use components that make sense”. He added that Google will be working “very closely” with partners that are interested in the Android Go configuration to make sure that “these devices perform well”. When will the first Android Go devices ship? And at what price points? As announced at the keynote, the first Android Go devices are expected to hit the market in 2018. In terms of price, Samat won’t commit to a number, saying that the objective of the Android Go project is “not to set a price point”. The idea, he explains, is to “allow manufacturers who are building entry-level devices to bring their price points as far down as they can” without compromising the overall experience. Why the 1GB RAM limit for Android Go devices? With many entry-level devices like the Rs. 6,999 (approximately $108) Xiaomi Redmi 4 shipping with 2GB of RAM, some might wonder why Google wants to optimise the experience for devices that may not represent a majority of smartphone shipments, especially by the time the first Android Go phone ships in 2018. We asked Samat to weigh in on the subject. “I think that the data that we are seeing from industry analysts and what our manufacturing partners tell us is that there are many, many devices shipping - millions of devices shipping - every year with 1GB [RAM] and below,” he says. As per Counterpoint’s Market Monitor data, smartphones with 1GB or less RAM accounted for more than one-fourth of the total smartphone shipments during Q1 2017 in India. “It is a sharp decline compared to last year, when contribution of the same segment was more than half of the total smartphone shipments,” Pavel Naiya, Senior Analyst, Devices and Analytics at Counterpoint tells Gadgets 360. “Even though market size of this segment (smartphones with 1GB or less RAM) has declined, there is enough pie left for Google to address with Android Go,” he adds. “One sizeable market is new entry-level smartphone users. As majority of the mobile phone users in India are still using feature phones and will eventually upgrade to entry-level smartphones.” Samat believes this number could go even higher with Android Go. “I think in some ways, device manufacturers are moving to add more and more memory because they want to make sure there’s a good experience, and what we are saying is that adds cost also,” he says. “So if we can make an experience that’s good with less RAM, then we believe people will wanna offer less expensive phones still with a good experience and you will see more of those phones ship.” Will Android Go make Android’s fragmentation problem worse - from a developer’s perspective? What about OEMs? Samat says Android Go is API identical to the ‘main’ Android O, so developers need not worry about fragmentation. For the OEMs, he believes they deal with enough old versions of Android that working with a single, different configuration of a new Android version will actually be a relief. “Most OEMs today manage many different branches because their entry-level devices are almost never shipping on the latest release of Android,” Samat says. “At least now, we want more of them to be shipping on the latest release of Android - there may be some build configurations in the factory that are different between the two [Android O and Android Go]. What we’ve heard from the manufacturers is that’s much easier for them to maintain than the multiple different versions of Android.” Will I see Android Go update on my existing device? Almost certainly no. Samat says the focus of the Android Go project is on new devices only, so don’t expect your existing entry-level phone to get Android O’s Go configuration.

Digital Trends Home > Cool Tech > Powered by Google Assistant, this robot bartender… Powered by Google Assistant, this robot bartender can take verbal drink orders By Luke Dormehl — Updated May 20, 2017 1:31 am Subscribe Share Subscribe on YouTube Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you Who doesn't want an on-call bartender at the end of the day? Google Assistant can carry out comprehensive images searches, cue up your favorite Netflix shows, read you the news, and … mix you a mean cocktail? At least, it can if you’re referring to the Google Assistant-powered Mocktails Mixer, developed by Pittsburgh-based creative agency Deeplocal. First shown off at this year’s Google I/O conference, the robotic bartender uses a combination of a Raspberry Pi, an inbuilt microphone, a speaker, an LED Ring,  a peristaltic pump, and some pretty impressive Google-powered AI to blend a range of delicious beverages. The resulting creation packs eight different containers (so, yes, it can be modified to include the hard stuff for those of drinking age!), which can be mixed together in different ratios according to user preference. Looking for a geeky special attraction for your summer kickoff party? Google has your back. “It’s programmed to serve up a mixed drink of your choice and chat with you while you wait — whether that means telling you a joke or offering up small talk,” Greg Baltus, Chief Technology Officer at Deeplocal, told Digital Trends. “Our team created the mixer to inspire makers to explore other fun ways to use the new Google Assistant SDK.” They are not just stopping at “inspiring” makers, either. The team has already shared open source code and instructions for the Mocktails Mixer on GitHub. Since all of the parts are readily accessible or easy to fabricate, anybody can build and customize their own version to be sipping cocktails in no time. With Deeplocal’s prototype costing around $570, it won’t even set you back too much money. “People use voice assistants when their hands are full, especially in the kitchen,” Baltus continued. “When it comes to kitchen-focused DIY projects, robotic bartenders are becoming more and more popular. We wanted to create a new spin on the robotic bartender that demonstrates the capabilities of the Google Assistant.” We guess you’re fine so long as you don’t start complaining to the bartender about robots stealing human jobs while you’re waiting for your drink!
Digital Trends Home > Android Army > Enlist in the Android Army: A beginner’s… Enlist in the Android Army: A beginner’s guide to Android By Digital Trends Staff — Updated May 20, 2017 12:01 pm Share Twin Design/Shutterstock Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends This article was updated on May 17 by Carlos Vega to include information regarding the Quick Settings bar and Google Assistant. For anyone who’s been living with iOS for years, getting started on Android — Google’s mobile operating system — can be daunting. And if you’ve never owned a smartphone before, the prospect of navigating new software might be a concern. Although there are many different versions of Android, and some companies put their own customized user interfaces on top of it, there are some basic tips that everyone can use to master Android. To help you get started, below is a comprehensive guide on using the platform and its various functions. You can also check out our list of the best smartphones and smartwatches, if you want to get a better idea regarding the Android ecosystem. Setting up your new phone Before you can do anything on Android, you need to boot up your phone and set it up. When you switch on your device for the first time, you’ll be asked to select a language. Press Start when you’ve picked a language, and connect your phone to a nearby Wi-Fi network. This should be easy — simply choose the right network and enter the appropriate password. Android is built by Google, and as such, it works best with Google’s proprietary services. To take full advantage of your device, you’re going to need a Google account. If you have a Gmail address, you already have a Google account. If you don’t, simply select Get an account and follow the on-screen instructions. You don’t technically need a Google account to use your phone, but it is required if you want to download apps, back up your data, and use other Google apps and services. Manufacturers such as HTC and Samsung may ask you if you want to create an additional, manufacturer-specific account, but you don’t really need to unless you want to use that company’s services as well. You should also make sure that you enable backups on your device so your data isn’t lost if there’s a problem later. Head to Settings > Accounts, select your Google account, and check everything you want to sync. To ensure that all your photos are saved for posterity, you should download Google Photos (if it’s not on your phone already). It offers unlimited cloud storage for all your pictures, and you can access them on any device, whether it be your PC, Mac, iPad, or Android. During the setup process, you may be asked if you want to add a passcode, pattern, or fingerprint to lock your device. Doing so will add extra security to your device, and if your phone has a fingerprint sensor, you should set it up for Android Pay, Google’s all-in-one payments platform. To set up the fingerprint sensor, simply place your finger on the sensor multiple times until your digit is registered. You’ll also be asked to set up a passcode or PIN for backup purposes, just in case your fingerprint can’t be read. Once you’ve set up your device, you should check to see if there’s a software update available. To do this, press on the Settings app, scroll to the bottom, press About phone, and select System updates. On the next screen, you’ll see a Check for update button. Press it, and your phone will check to see if any updates are available. If so, you can download and install them. The navigation buttons Unlike the home button in iOS, manufacturers typically equip Android devices with three touch-sensitive buttons at the bottom of the screen. Various manufacturers have received flack in the past for deviating from Google’s vision. However, the most recent versions of the OS are relatively devoid of inconsistencies. Pretty much every essential action starts and ends with the three buttons, all of which are featured below. Back Button: The back button, on the left, will take you back to the last thing you did in an app, or revert to the last page in your mobile browser. Additionally, holding the button down when using your browser should automatically open up a menu that makes it easy to access your favorite bookmarks, browsing history, and the websites you visit most often. Home Button: The home button, located in the middle, will simply take you back to your home screen. In the most recent version of Android, holding down the home button will also activate “Screen search,” which pulls up the Google Assistant, Google’s AI-powered helper, from any app. More on that later. Overview Button: The overview button, on the right, functions like the multi-tasking function in iOS. Pressing this button reveals a vertical list of every open and active app on your mobile device, allowing you to quickly navigate and jump between various apps with a simple tap of the screen. Multiple homescreens Much like the iPhone, Android devices allow you to manage multiple home screens — up to five in earlier versions of Android, and as many as you like if you have Android 4.4 KitKat or above. However, unlike iOS, Android “centers” your primary home screen, while other screens are located to the left and right. Android’s personalization features really shine, here. Users can create shortcuts and group apps together within folders, but Android doesn’t force you to store apps on the home screen the way iOS does. Instead, you can install and store apps in the App Drawer located within the dock. Android also allows you to create, resize, and arrange various widgets on the home screen. Widgets display real-time information from apps on the home screen, and some of them are interactive. The Quick Settings bar The Quick Settings bar is a convenient way to quickly access your most-used toggles, and it’s also where you can see and dismiss all of your notifications. However, it may not be obvious how to use it at first. The good news is that the Quick Settings bar works the same way regardless of which version of Android you have on your smartphone. To use it, swipe down once from the top to reveal your notifications. If you swipe down again, it will reveal all the quick toggles. If you don’t like swiping down twice to reveal both the quick toggles and the notifications, you can swipe down using two fingers. Now that you can see your toggles and notifications, there are various ways for dealing with both. To deal with notifications, you can either tap to open a notification, you can swipe to dismiss it, or you can tap the three horizontal bars in the bottom right of the notifications to clear them all at once. The toggles are easy to deal with at first glance. If you want to turn something on or off, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, just tap the icon once. There is another hidden feature that is extremely useful, and that is a tap and hold gesture. If you tap and hold an icon in the Quick Settings bar for a couple of seconds, the full settings for that toggle will open. This can save you a lot of time digging through the settings menu. For example, if you are trying to pair Bluetooth headphones with your phone, you can tap and hold the Bluetooth toggle, and that will take you to the Bluetooth settings, where you can pair your device. You should also be aware that you can tap the icons at the top of the Quick Settings bar. You can tap the battery icon to reveal the battery settings, for instance, or the cogwheel icon to access your system settings. And if you tap your profile picture, you can add more users. It’s also worth mentioning that every new version of Android will slightly update the Quick Settings bar, and that some manufacturers make their own tweaks. This bar is one of the most important features of Android and one of the features you will use the most. If you purchase a device running Android Nougat, for example, you will see an Edit option in the lower-right corner. If you tap this, it will let you drag and rearrange the icons in your tray. You can also drag new icons and get rid of the ones you seldom use. All these features are useful, but if you follow our simple guide, you will at least have the basic information on how this bar works, regardless of how Google updates it in future iterations of Android.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

 Why Google DeepMind's work with the NHS is being investigated by the regulators Sam Shead May 20, 2017, 8:00 AM 2,156 facebook linkedin twitter email print DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman.Google DeepMind DeepMind's work with the NHS has been in the spotlight again this week after a regulator referred to one of the company's key partnerships with the NHS as legally inappropriate. The Google-owned research lab is working with several NHS trusts but its first NHS deal with Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust is proving to be the most troublesome. The deal with The Royal Free was quietly signed in September 2015 and it gave DeepMind permission to process 1.6 million NHS patient records from November 2015 to November 2016. The records belong to patients that have visited Royal Free Hospital. DeepMind said it needed access to the medical records to help it test its kidney monitoring mobile app, which is called Streams and has the potential to save lives by sending out alerts to clinicians when their patient's condition suddenly deteriorates. But medical records contain some of our most private information, including things like whether a person has had an abortion or what a person's HIV status is, as well as our full names and addresses.  DeepMind and The Royal Free have insisted from the beginning that the patient data is safe and that they're taking all the necessary precautions with it. DeepMind has also said on multiple occasions that the patient records cannot be seen by parent company Google and that they will not be passed onto a third party. The Streams app.Google DeepMind From day one, DeepMind and The Royal Free have also insisted that the deal is legally sound on the basis that the Streams app is providing "direct care" to patients — something that automatically assumes "implied consent" on the patient's behalf. But the deal's legal basis doesn't stand up A letter leaked to Sky News and published on Monday shows that the National Data Guardian (NDG), Dame Fiona Caldicott, wrote to The Royal Free in February 2017 to let them know that the legal basis for the data-sharing deal that they used to test Streams was "inappropriate". "Given that Streams was going through testing and therefore could not be relied upon for patient care, any role the application may have played in supporting the provision of direct care would have been limited and secondary to the purpose of the data transfer," she wrote. "My considered opinion therefore remains that it would not have been within this reasonable expectation of patients that their records would have been shared for this purpose." Those words can't have gone down well with execs at DeepMind or The Royal Free.  So if "direct care" wasn't the legal basis for the data-transfer deal then what was? DeepMind and The Royal Free are yet to specify another legal basis for their deal, possibly because it doesn't satisfy any of them.  Julia Powles, a technology law professor at Cornell University, told Business Insider: "Any other basis required approval in advance — and DeepMind had no such approvals."  The NDG highlighted in her letter that there is a gap in the current legislation on the legal bases for transferring NHS data and it looks as though DeepMind agrees. In a memo sent to DeepMind Health's review board that was seen by Business Insider, DeepMind agreed, saying the NDG's findings "exposed a guidance gap about how hospitals should test new systems."  There are a number of other legal bases that data transfer deals between the NHS and a private company can fall under when identifiable patient information is involved. They include: Consent — this involves asking each of the individuals involved if you can use their data. Given the number of patient records that DeepMind wanted access to, this may not have been realistic. Section 251 — this is a section of the NHS Act 2006 that permits a patient's sensitive identifiable data to be shared without their explicit consent for some purposes other than their care. It was introduced when the Department of Health recognised that there were essential activities of the NHS, and important medical research, that required the use of identifiable patient information. Public interest — confidential medical information can also be disclosed when there is a case sufficient to override both the duty of confidence owed to an individual and also the public interest in keeping health records confidential. "The threshold for disclosure will be a relatively high one," the government wrote in a data sharing and protection document in 2007. Jenny Westaway, a spokesperson for the NDG, told Business Insider: "There are other legal bases that could be used to share data if the right conditions are met but I don't want to give the impression by naming other legal bases that these are valid. "If they (DeepMind and The Royal Free) are now seeking to suggest that another legal basis would have been viable, I think it's up to them to say what that legal basis is and how they met it." The NDG is a non-statutory body (the bill to make it statutory failed this month) so it has no real power to issue any form of punishment. However, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), the UK's main data watchdog, is carrying out its own investigation into whether the deal was legal under the Data Protection Act and a verdict is expected to be made public in the coming weeks. It's likely that DeepMind and The Royal Free will try and hold off providing any further statements on the legal basis for their deal until that verdict is made public. If the ICO concludes that the deal wasn't legal, then DeepMind and the Royal Free can expect some form of punishment, which will likely be issued in the form of a fine.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart May 20, 2017 5:00 AM PDT @GebAndrew At the Google I/O Developer Conference, I tried a cocktail made by the Google Assistant. The man who showed off this voice controlled mix master also hosted a session in which he described the possibilities for the future of Google's voice control platform. Chris Ramsdale, the lead product manager for the company's digital assistant, talked about building it into Wi-Fi routers, cars, and ovens. Ramsdale wasn't making product announcements for Google, instead he was getting a room full of developers excited about the possibilities of Google's smart home. Google recently opened its digital assistant to developers. The Google Assistant still trails Amazon's assistant Alexa in device versatility -- in particular it has no low cost entry point, akin to Amazon's $50, Alexa-equipped Echo Dot. Google's gamble is that its community of developers will help fill that gap. Google Assistant is your new bartender At Google I/O, CNET's Andrew Gebhart shows us how Google Assistant is being integrated into everyday devices like cocktail mixers. by Andrew Gebhart 1:35 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Seeking versatility At I/O, Google announced a number of improvements to its smart speaker, the $130 Google Home, that will likely serve as the center of Google's smart home plans. Thanks to better features and improved compatibility with Google's own apps like Calendar and Maps, the Google Home is now in a good position to compete with and even outdo the Amazon Echo -- a similar smart speaker that also functions as a personal assistant, smart home controller, and music streamer. Nevertheless, Amazon's assistant Alexa is still built into more first party smart speakers -- including our favorite of the bunch, the $50 Echo Dot. The Dot brings all of the Echo's functionality to a more compact speaker that plugs into your existing sound system. Amazon also has the portable Tap, and the upcoming Echo Show -- an Alexa device with a screen -- and the Echo Look -- an Echo device with a camera. Google Home packed with new features, including hands-free calling Google Home gets a slew of new features, including hands-free calling, support for Spotify and HBO Now, and integration with your TV. 3:49 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF In terms of dedicated smart speakers, Google still just has the Google Home. Until recently, the Google Assistant built into the Home was only available on that one speaker and certain Android phones like the Google Pixel. With I/O wrapping up, Google didn't mention any new version of the Home meant to compete with the ultra-affordable Dot. At least for now, the search giant is taking a different approach -- let the company's community of developers do the work for them. Google's crowd-sourced smart home Developers can now build Google-based voice control into whatever device they want, and create custom commands to go along with it. The Mocktails Mixer used the Assistant's normal voice to answer questions about weather, but switched to a different voice for the commands specifically built for the Mixer. Ramsdale didn't even need to use Google's traditional wake words "OK Google." He simply hit a button on the side of the machine and talked. In theory, this will provide developers a simple path to create unique hardware that fits under Google's smart home umbrella. With the Assistant built right into an oven, you can hit a button and talk to your appliance. You can do this to an extent with the Google Home and certain commercial ovens from GE and Whirlpool, but you need to use awkward phrases to wake up the right skill. Enlarge Image Google Home can control certain large appliances from GE, Whirlpool, and LG. Tyler Lizenby/CNET With GE smart ovens, for example, you need to invoke GE's smart bot Geneva and say a command such as "OK Google, ask Geneva Home to preheat the oven to 350 degrees." The Google Assistant can't recognize the attributes of the oven on its own, so you need to activate GE's custom program and ping GE's cloud to get a response. An oven with the Assistant built in could supposedly avoid all of that. A developer could build customized language, and because the Assistant would already be tied to the hardware, it could control the oven while skipping the cloud entirely. Google's already working toward building voice control into your TV, but ideally, you could soon control your smart home by talking to any entertainment device, or any appliance. I'd also wish for a voice control hub that could double as a SmartThings-like hub to help you connect peripherals like motion sensors to the cloud. See Google Assistant on Android TV in action Streaming boxes and televisions running Android TV will soon have the ability to turn on lights, operate other smart home gadgets and better respond to voice commands. 2:09 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Rallying the troops At I/O, Google offered many inroads to developers looking to join its smart home team. Mark Spate and David Schairer -- the product and engineering leads for the smart home -- showed a simple path for integrating a new smart device into Google's existing smart home software. During the demo, Schairer even used the Google Actions program to build commands for new lightbulbs from scratch within about 10 minutes.

Vera Tzoneva -- who works on partners for the Assistant -- mentioned "implicit triggers" that will help app builders get their product discovered, as the Google Assistant will be able to recommend a specific third party skill if you say something like "OK Google, help me work out." At the "What's new in Google's IoT platform?" session shortly after the main keynote, Google's developer advocate -- Wayne Piekarski -- even said, "The internet of things is going to be bigger than phones." Google's offering lots of branches to developers, and showed a commitment to getting them excited to work with their smart home platform at I/O. Playing catch-up Enlarge Image The Home followed in the Echo's footsteps. Chris Monroe/CNET At present, Google still has a long way to go to catch the Echo in sales. Roughly 70 percent of people that own a smart speaker own one from the Echo line -- according to research firm eMarketer. Even opening up the Assistant to developers is playing catch up. Amazon's already done it, and we've seen Alexa pop up in intercoms, cool looking lamps, and even third-party speakers. But the Android operating system is the most popular in the world. At I/O, Google started to leverage its established Android community in the race to the smart home. As Google is just presenting these options to developers now, we won't see a useful variety of third party devices built with the Google Assistant for awhile. Right now, if you want to talk to the Assistant, you're still limited to smartphones and the Google Home. Google greatly increased the number of compatible smartphones by bringing the Assistant to Apple's mobile operating system at I/O, but that still doesn't offer a simple, low cost way to get started with the Google smart home. A bird in the hand 20 Google I/O, a playground for developers (pictures) Meanwhile, the affordable Echo Dot continues to be the best available option for always-listening controls. I doubt anyone is going to hold off on buying a Dot for the possibility of something better from Google years down the line. Eventually, creative new devices from its community of developers might add up to enough versatility to overtake Alexa and Amazon. Google's best near term bet is a new first party device -- a smaller, more affordable version of the Home. Google needs a Dot of its own. Thanks to its developers, the future of Google's smart home is promising. The present is still missing an easy way in.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Here’s a look at the key takeaways from the developers conference. Written by Anuj Bhatia | San Francisco | Updated: May 21, 2017 12:55 am Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning took the centerstage at this year’s I/O. This year’s I/O, Google’s annual developers conference, which held earlier this week in Mountain View, California, is over now. The keynote was addressed by CEO Sundar Pichai, followed by a number of technical sessions throughout the three-day conference. At its keynote, India-born Pichai reiterated Google’s transition announced last year from “mobile first” to “AI first”. Here’s a look at the key takeaways from this year’s I/O. Google sees future in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning took the centerstage at this year’s I/O. Google’s core products, be it Google Photos to Assistant, will take advantage of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. That’s the larger plan moving forward. For example, Google is embedding artificial intelligence to cameras. Pichai announced a new technology called Google Lens. All you need to point your camera at an object, and your device will automatically identify what it is seeing. Google says pointing a camera at a WiFi router’s password label and WiFi network name will automatically get connected the phone to that WiFi network. Using machine learning, Google’s Smart Reply feature will suggest possible smart responses to incoming emails based on your typing style and habits. The silicon valley behemoth wants to use machine learning to help more people find jobs. Google for Jobs, a new initiative announced at the annual developers conference, will use Google’s search power and machine learning to collect millions of job postings from across the internet. It’s embedded in Google search for faster, accurate results. Google Assistant gets smarter, more capable than ever Google Assistant is smarter and more responsive than ever, all thanks to AI and machine learning. For example, it’s now got the ability to interact through text. So, if you don’t want to speak out loud in the public – which can be really embarrassing – simply type of queries on the phone. Another great feature is the integration with Google Lens that uses AI and has built-in image recognition capabilities. It does make sense to improve Google Assistant – after all the voice-activated assistant is now available on 100 million devices. Plus, Google Assistant has finally arrived on the iPhone – a move we think will make Google more competitive in this space. Google aims to make VR/AR accessible to millions Like its Android platform, Google wants to make VR/AR accessible to millions. Just after launching its Daydream VR platform six month ago, the company earlier this week revealed that standalone headsets are finally coming, no phone or PC required. Both HTC and Lenovo will make a headset based on a Google reference design built in partnership with Qualcomm. Google also revealed that Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+ will receive a software update making them Daydream compatible. LG’s next flagship smartphone, likely the V30 that launches in later this year, will also be Daydream ready. The software giant showed its commitment to augmented reality as well. A Tango-compatible smartphone, ASUS ZenFone AR that will be available this summer. It also announced Tango into the classroom with Expeditions AR. ‘Android Go’ will expand user base significantly Google’s mobile operating system has more than 2 billion active monthly Android users in the world. This is the big milestone in itself. It just shows Google’s reach through a mobile OS that has over 2 billion users. Things don’t end here. Google, obviously, wants more people to use Android as a preferred mobile OS. So, it announced a new Android Go project that could significantly multiply its user base especially in countries like India and Brazil. This is a new variant of Android O designed for entry-level smartphones. It is still Android O, but the software has been optimised for smartphones with lower capable hardware internals. While we didn’t see any new smartphone that’s being powered by Android Go, but Google says the first devices will ship only in 2018.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 69 Plus 1 on G+ 115 Share on Facebook 79 Share on Twitter Total Shares263 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it).

I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason.

New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I wasn't saying the G6 has the best camera. I was saying that 23% of the Pixel pictures have halos and 100% of the G6 pictures do not. The halo problem is not a rare occurrence. I don't buy a phone for its camera. But if I did, and my only two choices were the G6 and the Pixel, I would definitely buy the G6. If my choices included other phones, I wouldn't buy the G6 or the Pixel. thereasoner It must be rare and only under certain circumstances because I've taken well over 200 pics so far on my Pixel and haven't seen it once. Just because one reviewers chosen testing parameters show the halo that doesn't mean that the test reflects real world use/performance from users like me. The so called halo thing wasn't even discovered in initial tests/reviews so does that mean there must be no halo? Going by your standards then I just need to pick a review that rarely shows it then. Unlike you, the camera is one of my top priorities when I choose a smartphone, I use it a lot so it's important to me and I couldn't be happier with the speed and quality of the Pixel cameras myself. It's no wonder that they're​ rated so well and that most reviewers absolutely love it, halo or no halo. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. 23% of the pictures on Phandroid, but 0% on your special magic Pixel. Totally believable, especially since you showed us all 200 of your perfect pictures instead of just saying so. Damn those Google liars saying it's a known defect. thereasoner Oh, I'm sure it's there it's just like early reviewers, I too haven't seen it yet but you're only interested in this one review apparently, no other reviews or user experience even matters unless it feeds your hate. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I know, damn those haters at Google saying it's a known defect. thereasoner The haters aren't the ones acknowledging the issue, it's those like you desperately blowing it out of proportion by using one review while simultaneously turning a blind eye to other more positive reviews and users real world experiences. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Users' real-world experiences are nothing but anecdotes. Initial positive reviews occurred before the defect was widely recognized and acknowledged by Google. And Google phones always get positive reviews because they're Google phones. Google could release a crayon drawing of a phone for the Pixel XL 2 and websites would call it the best phone of 2017. Websites can't afford to bite the hand that feeds them and lose both Google advertising and all the downstream advertising. HTC has shipped 2 million Pixel and Pixel XL phones since launch (and that figure doesn't account for all the returned and replaced phones). Obviously not many people see the superiority that you do. And don't bother with the "advertising" excuse. I see the Pixel advertised more than any other phone. thereasoner You really do live in your own little world don't you? Lmao! Have fun making up nonsense, you're only fooling yourself :-) Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Psychological projection is a theory in psychology in which humans defend themselves against their own unconscious impulses or qualities (both positive and negative) by denying their existence in themselves while attributing them to others. whispy_snippet User real world experiences and positive reviews are irrelevant. Only the small amount of negative fringe reviews that deliberately focus on shooting in ways that reveal the halo matter. Right. Got it. whispy_snippet 23% of images taken by Phandroid or 100% of images taken in circumstances that are known to result in the halo effect. It's perfectly feasible to shoot hundreds of images with the Pixel and never see a halo. Look, ultimately no amount of reason is going to convince you because you obviously just hate the fuck out of Google. You simply insist that the Pixel has an enormous issue when it does not. So whatever. Good luck to you mate. whispy_snippet Hahahaha you're so weird!!! Why are you such a hater? What on earth? You're so completely irrational. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Disappeared? You're just not worth the time. But I came here to get a link and noticed your reply. So... Someone tell this guy he's a big fat liar: support dot google dot com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg This Google fanboy is a big fat liar, too: highonandroid dot com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Here's that liar's video. He must have hacked the video to support his lies about there being a halo problem. www dot youtube dot com/watch?v=GUjhM2xcKSY whispy_snippet Yes, so as I've agreed many times now, there is a halo effect that sometimes (very rarely) occurs when shooting with the Pixel in specific circumstances. But I see you've conveniently ignored the chromatic aberation and purple flaring I pointed out in the G6 images. No surprises there. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Yep, as I suspected, radio silence once you got hit with a dose of reality. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. Marcelove "You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. " HAHA, yeah... Ridiculous is someone like you that ignore all negatives only to not feel bad about the choice of buying a Dead Pixel like you did. But a " photographer " like you said you are that chooses a device without OIS over others with it shows what kind of expert you are at photography. whispy_snippet I've posted this elsewhere but I'll post it again: If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery. It utilises a complex process similar to bracketing - stacking multiple, fast, high-ISO exposures to create an image and then combining these multiple exposures to "erase" noise in the shadows. "Computational photography" is how this process is described and it's a new and innovative approach to overcoming the limitations of small sensors in smartphone cameras. Traditionally, OIS is useful in that it allows a camera operator to use slower shutter speeds. The reason you'd want to use a slower shutter speed? To let more light hit the sensor when in a dim environment and therefore capture brighter, more detailed shots. In most cameras, once you start dropping below a shutter speed of around 1/25th of a second you need OIS to offset hand shake. Even the tiniest amount of hand movement at these sorts of shutter speeds can result in blurry images. However, unlike any other smartphone camera, the Pixel overcomes the need for OIS by using "computational photography" instead. As things get darker, the Pixel can keep shooting at high shutter speeds and still capture sufficient light where other cameras can't. Video is a little different and I could crap on about why this is the case. But in short, I think the Pixel could probably benefit from OIS in this area. However, I think its EIS does a pretty good job and will only keep improving (because unlike OIS, EIS can be improved with software tweaks). The future of smartphone photography almost certainly lies in software which is why the Pixel's​ camera is so exciting. If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. Marcelove STOP dude... WTF? Obviously you won't accept the fact that a Dead Pixel has flaws only because you paid a great sum for it... Usually people won't accept the reality of a bad choice, trying to turn a blind eye to not feel bad about their wrong decision and you are one of them. whispy_snippet Ugh. I'm wasting my time. thereasoner Haters going to hate. thereasoner Well over 200 pictures on my Pixel so far and not one single halo yet. I may come across one someday but overall the cameras have been absolutely fantastic! It's no wonder to me that these cameras are so highly rated, I've seen how good they are first hand. Why would a Pixel owner ignore there own results over a reviewers test that doesn't translate into said users real world performance? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Yeah, I believe you. thereasoner You don't have to believe me, believe all the initial reviews that failed to pick up on this obviously minor issue instead. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything.

The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. Marcelove "proven this on Twitter" https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b672c337b9ea66b308150a002d3b0e7965c7903f926c609808fe53619dc81cd0.jpg abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Marcelove Nope, you are a weirdo saying that from 3 phones ( S7, iPhone 7 and Dead Pixel ) you gave priority to the only one that doesn't have OIS. Worst, you work with photography... I feel for whoever uses your service... whispy_snippet If you did your homework on the way the Pixel captures images you'd know that it doesn't need OIS for still imagery.

If you want to get smarmy I'm happy to school you, mate. thereasoner You're just revealing yourself as a blind hater with your childish name calling of the Pixel. You're perspective is poisoned by the bias your hate provides. Your take on OIS is just another example. Google used high end VR quality sensors on board to assist with EIS and many reviews show excellent results from that as well but you're only interested in those that can give you your hate fix. whispy_snippet Yep, no response. Thought so. thereasoner That says it all right there, these guys are haters doing their thing and they will desperately cling on to any negatives​ they can get while blindly ignoring results from owners in real world conditions. They can't help themselves, it's what they do. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed whispy_snippet My wife has an iPhone 7. To my eye the Pixel kills the iPhone 7 in low light. In fact in almost every situation it bests the 7. The only area I'd give to Apple's phone is video. thereasoner Yep, and reviews show the same. Apple finally did improve low light performance with the 7 years after everyone else was beating them but the Pixel cameras are considered the best in countless reviews for good reason. Andy Maybe her phone is defected. Pixel photos in the bar this weekend looked orange and iPhone looked normal. Even. You moto z looked better. whispy_snippet Ok Jordan L I'll say that I snap a lot of photos with my Pixel XL.. I have seen the lens flare issue when there is direct full sun at a certain angle on the lens. Rare, but fun to reproduce for Pixel haters. Marcelove "You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want " So I choose yours. abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? thereasoner Mines been awesome thanks ! mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. whispy_snippet Thanks for your wholly robust and meaningful assumption. 2kool4skool Hey it's not scientific by any means but if you're like me who have read tons of articles about pixel's problems, you wouldn't blame me for assuming the problems are more widespread than just "1%". whispy_snippet It's called confirmation bias, mate. Look it up. 2kool4skool Dunno mate, call me bias or whatever, but all these articles do make me a bit paranoid about pixel. whispy_snippet "Confirmation bias, also called confirmatory bias or myside bias, is the tendency to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's preexisting beliefs or hypotheses." Just a quick wiki search. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling. "Can't" jacob grammar mistake not a spelling mistake :) PoisonApple31 I didn't say it was a spelling mistake. I said missing your apostrophe made you look stupid when you were talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! So the solution to fingerprint sensor problems is not to use it. Check. Adam Margeson No issues here and I use mine all the time! whispy_snippet Ditto. Alex Cruz Off topic but this 'Felonious Monk' guy seems like he's butt hurt over some shit hahaha Is like an ex-wife trying to 'I told you so' about some shit. Felonious Monk get some pussy bro, it helps with that butt hurt you got..... Fakhri Ahmad Microsoft should come in hard with new phones and entice all the users android has frustrated. Now's the time to try out a different OS DragoCubed Windows 10 mobile? Nope. It ain't happening. Though once Microsoft is done fiddling with full windows... DragoCubed Oh you, classic Google. This is why we hate... I mean love you. LOL Pixel XL and Nexus 5x, haven't noticed this issue Pris p I'm getting an iPhone next time. I'm tired of having boot loop worries and my videos looking all pixelized on social media. I haven't even downloaded the update because I'm afraid. It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years. Apple products(ipad excluded) are nice looking pieces of shit. Marco Antonio Maza Hernández What is going on with android? every update brings a new problem. mattcoz Has anybody had this problem in the final 7.1.2 release and not had it in the 7.1.2 beta? I finally got the OTA but am hesitant to update. Wesley I'm having this problem on the Nexus 6P. It won't recognize my fingerprint but I can still use the swipe gesture for notifications... This might be interesting. I went into settings to double check my Android version and tapped it to see the Easter egg (I forgot what it was.). When I noticed it was the stupid cat thing, I also noticed I could turn it off so I did. Now the scanner is recognizing my fingerprint again - not perfectly but it's better than nothing at all. Wayren Oh I do not seem to have the best luck with Google phones lately. I was using a Nexus 6P until it started suffering from the early shutdown issue, after which neither Huawei nor Google would help. Now the Google Pixel I have been using for two months with zero issues spontaneously develops these issues, down to the gestures still working perfectly. What is going on, Google?

This is how Amazon plans to steal your ad business Here is Google’s vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, “Ok, Google,” triggering the company’s Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it’s ready when you arrive.   Right now, Amazon.comand its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realising that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles.   That’s just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers’ lives. What’s more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers — an area where Google has struggled. Amazon’s Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google’s rival Home device only came out late last year.   “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways,” said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com,a website about voice-based commerce and computing. “Googleis trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that havea voice. That philosophy limitsits ability to really go after Amazon.”   Central to Alexa’s appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google’s tally. The Alphabet Inc. unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon’s lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful.   The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music.   “A lot of what you need to get done is transactional,” said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. “We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts.”   Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers.   It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant.   It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon’s Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills — the equivalent of an app for Amazon’s voice-based system — up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built byoutside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn’t available publicly yet.   Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organising information from the Web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions.

Amazon’s Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google’s rival Home device only came out late last year.   “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways,” said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com,a website about voice-based commerce and computing. “Googleis trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that havea voice. That philosophy limitsits ability to really go after Amazon.”   Central to Alexa’s appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google’s tally. The Alphabet Inc. unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon’s lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful.   The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music.   “A lot of what you need to get done is transactional,” said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. “We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts.”   Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers.   It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant.   It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon’s Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills — the equivalent of an app for Amazon’s voice-based system — up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built byoutside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn’t available publicly yet.   Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organising information from the Web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions.

However, its use is largely confined to urban or semi-urban areas. The ‘Internet Saathi’ programme is different. It teaches rural women to use and benefit from the Internet, writes New York based Michael Gallant. The phrase ‘Internet Saathi’ translates into ‘Internet friend.’ The programme has been designed keeping the specific needs of rural women in mind initiated by Google in India which aims at transcending its image as an easy- to- search Internet tool. “We strongly believe that easy and quick access to information can transform lives,” says Sapna Chadha, head of marketing for Google India. The  groundbreaking initiative ‘Internet Saathi’ in partnership with Tata Trusts, is working to make that belief a reality, specifically for the country’s rural, less technologically educated women. “We modelled the entire initiative around India’s traditional information and communication distribution system,” says Chadha, “where the Internet Saathis are akin to the village postman, who is the single-point contact between the village and the outside world, in terms of information as well as communication.” Trained by Google, these saathis are roving educators and activists who travel to villages, armed with smartphones and tablets, and spend a minimum of two days per week, over a period of six months, teaching local residents about the Internet. They work hard to make sure their students become adept at using the Internet independently to gain knowledge that can benefit them in various aspects of their lives. “Once an Internet Saathi has completed the training in a cluster of three villages, she moves to an adjoining cluster of villages where she trains women to get online,” says Chadha. Google India works with local groups and organisations to continue the educational momentum in rural areas, even after the saathis have moved on. The Internet Saathis are seen as “change agents,” tenacious teachers who take great pride in their work. The efforts seem to have paid off. Chadha shares the story of Chetna, who lives in the Alwar district of Rajasthan and joined the programme in 2015. “Chetna not only learned about mustard farming techniques to run her farm, but her own experience also inspired her to train over 500 girls and women in a span of four months,” says Chadha. “Several women still reach out to                     her for a range of issues, including quick remedies   for   day-to-day  health  conditions and information on MGNREGA and other government schemes.” MGNREGA (Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act) guarantees 100 days of wage-employment in a year to a rural household. Bujii’s is another success story. She is an Internet Saathi in Somavaram, Andhra Pradesh, who trained her neighbour to advance her business of stitching and tailoring in various creative ways. “She is now able to use the extra money she makes to send her daughter to the best school in the area,” says Chadha, adding there are thousands of such success stories. The Internet Saathi programme was launched in July, 2015 to address a troubling trend observed by Google India team members. “As Internet penetration started gaining momentum in India, we realised that the usage of the Internet amongst women in India was lower than that in most countries in the world,” says Chadha. “Only one-third of India’s online users are women.” The situation is much worse in rural India, she continues, where only one in 10 Internet users is a woman. In response, Google India first launched an initiative called Helping Women Get Online in November, 2013, which sought to encourage daily Internet usage among women. But, it soon became clear to Google staff that specially crafted strategies were needed to reach those living in rural areas. “We took all the learnings [from Helping Women Get Online] and launched the Internet Saathi programme,” says Chadha. Spread across approximately 40,000 villages now, the programme aspires to reach over 300,000 villages, or half of the country’s villages, in the next few years. While trained Google educators have already worked with more than one million Indian women, there is still much to be done. “There are still a lot of women in rural and urban areas who do not know how to operate smartphones or are not aware about the benefits of the Internet,” says Chadha. “So, the best and easiest way to contribute is to help those women who are around you. These can be your domestic help or an elderly woman of the house who doesn’t know about the benefits of the Internet.” (Courtesy Span) TWF Share this: Tweet Share on Tumblr Print & PDF Related Download Daily Excelsior Apps Now: Share With Tweet This entry was posted in society, society-left.

And now it has come with new features that will excite you. Google Photos is an app used on Android smartphones and devices that allow you to save photos. It’s an alternative to keeping all those photos on your phone. At the Google I/O developer conference on Wednesday, May, 17, the team announced new features for sharing photos and printed photo books. The team also revealed its plans to turn your photos into business cards with just one tap. You can also link your photos of landmarks and paintings to descriptions from Google’s Knowledge Graph, reports The Verge. This was two years in the making, according to Google Photos team. They believe the camera roll will become obsolete and replaced by Photos. Most people have already been uploading or saving their photos to cloud software. It wouldn’t be unusual if they were using Google Photos for the same thing. “You don’t think about your life as a reverse chronological set of photos in order,” engineering director James Gallagher told The Verge. “You think about moments – this is when I started a job, or this is when I got married. That’s what we want our product to be – how we live our lives in photos.” [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Google has dabbled in photo apps before. Photos already come preinstalled on smartphones that use the Google version of Android. It also transferred over users of its previous service Picasa, which shut down last year. Google is making it easy for users to share photos, even if the recipient doesn’t have a Google Photos account. It allows users to share photos via SMS messages, emails, and on social media sites. Sharing photos have required action on the owner’s part. In the next few weeks, Google Photos will suggest that you share photos with the friends in your photos and it detects them in your photos. Google is a bit behind since Facebook has been doing it with its app Moments and on its social media site for years. Google is hoping that this feature will work just as well as Facebook’s, if not better. If Google Photos is what you use for photos, then that’s good news for users. “It takes all the work out of it,” Lieb says. “You still have complete control over what gets shared, and to whom. But it reduces the friction so much. In the best case, it’s literally two button presses.” Google doesn’t want to completely copy Facebook. They want to take that feature and turn into automated sharing between you and another trusted user. Once the recipient accepts your invite, they will see whatever photos you’ve authorized to share in real time. “Some people have a special person in their life for whom it is still kind of annoying to [ask] to hit share,” Lieb says. “If you have a spouse that you’re not cheating on, and kids that you’re always taking pictures of, it might make sense to automate that sharing. And so the team built a feature it calls the shared library, which lets one person see your photos as you take them in real time.” [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Google Photos’ other announcement is about its photo books. With this feature, you can make one on your phone or on the Web, starting at $10 to $20. That cost is only for the first 20 pages. Each additional page costs $0.35 to $0.65 and can add up quickly, especially if you just went on a long vacation. Google wants to make the books through the prompts in the Google Photos app. The team hopes that photo books will make users buy more books throughout the year. “It’s not just about the book that you make at the end of the year to capture the entire year,” says Aravind Krishnaswamy, another engineering director at Photos. “It can become this lightweight thing you do a lot more often.” Google Photos just hit 500 million monthly users. Photos users upload 1.2 billion images a day on the app. With its new features, the Photos team hopes to make your camera roll obsolete by the end of the year.

Until he came along, people had few places to go with their overflowing emotions and wild opinions, other than writing a letter to the newspaper or haranguing the neighbors.

In the history of communications technology, it was a development with echoes of Gutenberg. And so here we are in 2017. How’s it going, Mr. Williams? Sign Up For the Morning Briefing Newsletter “I think the internet is broken,” he says. He has believed this for a few years, actually. But things are getting worse. “And it’s a lot more obvious to a lot of people that it’s broken.” People are using Facebook to showcase suicides, beatings and murder, in real time. Twitter is a hive of trolling and abuse that it seems unable to stop. Fake news, whether created for ideology or profit, runs rampant. Four out of 10 adult internet users said in a Pew survey that they had been harassed online. And that was before the presidential campaign heated up last year. “I thought once everybody could speak freely and exchange information and ideas, the world is automatically going to be a better place,” Mr. Williams says. “I was wrong about that.” The Silicon Valley entrepreneur first drew notice during the dot-com boom, for developing software that allowed users to easily set up a website for broadcasting their thoughts: blogging. By the time Google bought the company in 2003, more than a million people were using it. Then came Twitter, which wasn’t his idea but was his company. He remains the largest individual shareholder and a board member. After fame and fortune come regrets. Mr. Williams is trying to fix some things. So, in different ways, are Google and Facebook, and even Twitter. This is a moment for patches and promises. The trouble with the internet, Mr. Williams says, is that it rewards extremes. Say you’re driving down the road and see a car crash. Of course you look. Everyone looks. The internet interprets behavior like this to mean everyone is asking for car crashes, so it tries to supply them. His goal is to break this pattern. “If I learn that every time I drive down this road I’m going to see more and more car crashes,” he says, “I’m going to take a different road.” But a new road may have other problems. It may, for instance, be a dead end. Mr. Williams isn’t the only one trying to fix this mess, of course. If he and others can’t find a path forward, if they can’t solve what he calls “the architecture of content creation, distribution and monetization on the internet,” there are unsettling implications for the future of news and ideas. Maybe it will be all car crashes, all the time. Twitter already feels like that. For five years, Mr. Williams has been refining a communications platform called Medium. Its ambition: define a new model for media in a world struggling under the weight of fake or worthless content. Medium is supposed to be social and collaborative without rewarding the smash-ups. It is supposed to be a force for good. “A beautiful space for reading and writing — and little else,” Mr. Williams called Medium at its public debut in 2012. “The words are central.” Early chatter was enthusiastic, based on Mr. Williams’s track record and the site’s ease of use. But Medium, which began out of step with nearly all other media, now seems to inhabit a different universe. At a moment when buzz can appear to be everything, Medium is not afraid to be dull. (“How to Expand Your Vocabulary” was featured on the “Popular on Medium” page.) As news becomes more visually oriented, the site stays focused on words. And it continues to strive for the broadest possible reach, welcoming all sorts of untested writers, though that may be changing. Medium’s latest incarnation, unveiled in late March, included a $5 monthly subscription for premium writing. The reaction was underwhelming. “Ev Williams Has Lost His Goddamn Mind,” ran the headline in The Next Web, an online publication. Critics say Medium is less a company than it is Mr. Williams’s 85-employee hobby. “The notion that you’re going to succeed as a writing site simply by putting quality first is not compatible with venture capital revenue expectations,” said Bill Rosenblatt, a media technology consultant. “No one would have funded this if it weren’t by Ev Williams.” Mr. Williams’s supporters say that it is a feature, not a bug, and that publishing needs all the experiments it can get. But they concede the road will be difficult. Biz Stone was at Twitter with Mr. Williams from the beginning. He joined his old friend at Medium as both a board member and an investor. “Ev chose the hardest thing to do,” Mr. Stone says. “He said, ‘I want to make publishing profitable.’ I was like, ‘Yeah, so does everyone else.’ How far along are we? Somewhere between zero and half a percent.” Farm to Silicon Valley Mr. Williams is 45, bearded and stick-thin. He looks more like a Beatnik poet, staying up until dawn to debate existentialism, than the son of a Nebraska farmer, which he is. Growing up in a place where he felt new people and new ideas were in short supply, he was starved for someone to talk to. Living in a football-loving culture, and hating what he called “the stereotypical jock mentality, small brains thinking they’re superior because they’re surrounded by big muscles,” did not help, Mr. Williams said. In 1993, a chance encounter with a new magazine at the mall in Grand Island, Neb., seemed to seal his destiny. It was the second issue of Wired, a publication dedicated to the geek gospel that a new world was dawning. One story was about a retired Army colonel named Dave Hughes who wanted to hook up all 5.5 billion brains on the planet. No farmer’s kid need ever be lonely again. After a detour or two, Mr. Williams arrived in Silicon Valley. If his vision was clear — get rid of the gatekeepers and let people talk — the road was not. Both Blogger, the software he helped develop for blogging, and Twitter diverged from what their start-ups were actually supposed to be doing, and Twitter in particular involved a lot of well-chronicled drama among the four founders. Mr. Williams is deliberate to a fault, and his stint as Twitter’s chief executive in 2008 was not a managerial success. “He’s not C.E.O. material,” his former girlfriend and the co-developer of Blogger, Meg Hourihan, said in 2010 when the Twitter board pushed him out. A few years ago, Twitter was viewed as a tool of liberation. It enabled, some believed, the Arab Spring uprisings in the Middle East. Twitter, like the internet itself, was putting tyranny on a short leash. Then the narrative turned darker, with the rise of trolling on the platform. President Trump has said he believes Twitter put him in the White House. Recently, Mr. Williams heard the claim for the first time. He mulled it over for a bit, sitting in his Medium office, which is noteworthy only for not having a desk. “It’s a very bad thing, Twitter’s role in that,” he said finally. “If it’s true that he wouldn’t be president if it weren’t for Twitter, then yeah, I’m sorry.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Mr. Williams’s remarks. In a commencement speech at the University of Nebraska this month, Mr. Williams noted that Silicon Valley has a tendency to see itself as a Prometheus, stealing fire from selfish gatekeeper gods and bestowing it on mere mortals. “What we tend to forget is that Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity,” Mr. Williams told the crowd. “Some would say that’s what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to Donald Trump.” Mr. Williams’s mistake was expecting the internet to resemble the person he saw in the mirror: serious, high-minded. “I’ve come to realize Ev is extremely intellectual and introspective,” Mr. Stone says. “If he could wave a magic wand, he’d have everyone write the kind of things he likes, like, ‘Here are suggestions on climate change.’” It was just another Utopian dream, Mr. Williams says. “The problem is that not everyone is going to be cool, because humans are humans,” he says. “There’s a lock on our office door and our homes at night. The internet was started without the expectation that we’d have to do that online.” Medium, and Money Writers want readers and, usually, money. Readers want to be entertained, instructed or outraged. Publishers need revenues and profits. Yet no one has come up with a satisfactory and sustainable way of harnessing the internet to satisfy all these parties without descending into sleaze and clickbait. “Now that we’ve made sharing information virtually effortless, how do we increase depth of understanding, while also creating a level playing field that encourages ideas that come from anywhere?” Mr. Williams wrote in Medium’s 2012 manifesto. Money, of course. In the beginning, Medium had an editorial staff that sought out writers and rewarded them modestly for their contributions, just like a traditional magazine. Abby Norman, then in her early 20s and working for the medical records department of a Maine hospital, was pulled in. “Medium was a group of writers loping around at a somewhat sedentary pace, and you could get $50 for a bleeding-heart essay and forge relationships with writers and editors,” she says. “They seduced me into this idea, that I had stuff worth saying.” Ms. Norman wrote 100 Medium pieces in a year, about her brother’s autism, her mother’s bulimia, her own health, and the enduring carnival that is popular culture. Some of them she was even paid for. She gained a following. But as Medium grew more popular with writers, she competed to be heard above the din, and struggled to find people that she herself wanted to read on the site. “Now being here is work, and it’s not ‘digging for buried treasure’ fun work, either,” she wrote on Medium last September. Medium was supposed to be developing its business around advertising, which would have paid for writers like Ms. Norman and made the site viable. Then it abruptly pivoted in January and laid off a third of the staff, or about 45 people. Advertising was suddenly no longer the solution but the villain. “Ad-driven systems can only reward attention,” Mr. Williams says. “They can’t reward the right answer. Consumer-paid systems can. They can reward value. The inevitable solution: People will have to pay for quality content.” Mr. Williams was late to arrive at this solution. The rest of the media got there long ago. Subscriptions have become more viable online in the last five years, refuting the long-held notion that no one would pay for writing on the web. Some publications have had significant increases since the election of Mr. Trump. Medium declined to say how many subscribers it has, saying that its effort is still informal. In any case, it’s not going to be an online magazine. Mr. Williams resists the notion that Medium should be seen as a traditional publisher, commissioning, editing and making stuff available. He suggested instead the bookstore model. Bookstores don’t commission material, but they curate it and sell it. “Write whatever you want, and we’ll pay you based on certain terms,” Mr. Williams says now. “Does that mean I’m the publisher, or you?” As Medium struggles to define itself, the older new communications platforms — Google, Facebook, Twitter — are trying to deal with their unexpected toxicity. Facebook is hiring thousands of screeners to monitor its Facebook Live. Google has announced structural changes to make it easier for human raters to flag low-quality results, so that asking “Did the Holocaust happen,” for instance, no longer brings up a white supremacist site. And Twitter seems to have had fewer reported episodes of harassment recently, which may count as progress. “I think we will fix these things,” Mr. Williams says. Just don’t hold your breath. The work has barely begun, he says. “Twenty years isn’t very long to change how society works.” Already a Relic? James Hong, best known for the popular rating-and-dating site Hot or Not? in the early 2000s, was an angel investor in Medium. He once told Mr. Williams that he had some new ideas about dating sites but feared that if he tackled them, “I’d be working on the same thing my whole entire life.” Mr. Williams had pondered for a moment and replied, “I’ve been working on the same thing my whole life.” Mr. Hong said: “It’s not a vanity project, it’s his calling. Other people calling it a vanity project actually tells me more about them than it does about Evan.” That kind of determination may raise the odds but says little about long-term success. The darkest theory about the failure of Medium to catch on as an influential writing site comes from Cliff Watson, a 46-year-old advertising executive and onetime Medium contributor from Omaha. He thinks it is already a relic of an earlier era, kind of like communicating by carrier pigeon or telegraph. “Medium feels like the perfect Obama-era platform: minimal, distinguished, self-important, elevated,” Mr. Watson says. “But as soon as the campaigns really ramped up their efforts in the primaries, we were living in a post-Obama world, metaphorically, and then literally. And that post-Obama world holds no room for minimalist, distinguished, self-important, elevated thoughtfulness.” So what’s a mere writer to do? Mr. Watson says he is now working on a screenplay. Even some Medium writers are critical of the new subscription effort, fearing they will lose whatever audience they may have had. “Why write for a pittance for your words,” wrote one of them, Keith Parkins, “only to then find no one is reading what you have taken the time and trouble to write, because it resides within a fenced-off ghetto?” Medium maintains it is doing well by the metrics it cares about. The company says that the number of posts on the site quadrupled in 2016, and that it has 60 million unique monthly readers. After raising $130 million from investors, it had a valuation of $600 million last year. Yet the path to significant revenue seems as elusive as ever. Mr. Williams is dismissive of those who say making Medium viable is not merely difficult, but flat-out impossible. “That’s why I’m doing this, and they’re not,” he says. The site is soliciting writers again. Ms. Norman recently got the call. Since she stopped focusing on Medium, her career has blossomed — she wrote a book on medical treatment of women’s pain, which is coming out next year from Nation Books — even as her health has declined from autoimmune ailments. “I’ve been trying not to die, frankly,” she says. “I’ve really moved on to other things out of necessity.” And yet. Medium hasn’t solved the problem of publishing on the internet, but neither has anyone else. “I’ll pitch them, because I’ve been invested all this time and I’ve hung on and hung on,” she says. “I’d like to see how it all pans out. I’d like to see it through.” Follow David Streitfeld on Twitter @DavidStreitfeld. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

College Savings Community Community Login Search Search: 3 Stocks That Look Just Like Google in 2004 Finding the next Google is a worthwhile pursuit. Here are three companies that might just be it. Rich Duprey, Matthew DiLallo, and Brian Feroldi (TMFCop) May 20, 2017 at 1:18PM Do one thing and do it well has served as a guidepost for many companies over the years. It certainly helped Google when it was just starting out over a decade ago. While it has since morphed into a many-headed hydra known as Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL)(NASDAQ:GOOG), with fingers in pies as diverse as Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, Chrome, and Android, not to mention ads, commerce, apps, cloud, and hardware products, its heart will always be search. That laser-like focus early on is what allowed it to be so successful, so we asked three top Motley Fool contributors to name a company they think is positioned today like Google was in 2004. Read on to find out why they believe ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) are similarly at the start of monstrous futures. Image source: Getty Images. This SaaS company is on a growth tear Brian Feroldi (ServiceNow): Companies that sell software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions have been stealing market share away from legacy providers for years. The reason is that SaaS products feature low upfront costs and free customers from having to deal with upgrade or maintenance issues. Those benefits are causing scores of companies to make the switch. ServiceNow is one such SaaS provider that has been growing like gangbusters since its founding in 2004. This company provides enterprise-level workflow software that is highly customizable and enables task automation. When combined with the platform's advanced data analytics capabilities, businesses everywhere have been clamoring to make the switch. Last year, ServiceNow's revenue grew by 38% to $1.4 billion, which makes it one of the fastest-growing SaaS companies on the market today. While that's impressive, the company thinks it is still in the early innings of its growth cycle. The company's management team -- which now includes the former CEO of eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) -- is targeting $4 billion in total revenue by 2020. That's the kind of rapid revenue growth that has helped power Google's stock higher over the years. The only knock against investing in ServiceNow is that the stock is expensive. Shares are trading at more than 11 times sales and north of 58 times forward earnings. That hints that the stock could stumble if its growth engine fails to live up to expectations. Still, ServiceNow has so far proven itself more than capable of living up to high expectations. That makes it a great stock for growth investors to get to know. Image source: Getty Images. The Google of China and so much more Matt DiLallo (Baidu): Chinese search giant Baidu has long reminded me of a younger version of Google. Like its search rival, Baidu dominates paid search in its home country. As a result, its sales and profits have grown exponentially over the years as users perform more searches, which draws more advertisers to its platform. Meanwhile, the company has ample running room to continue growing considering that just over half of China's citizens are even on the internet these days, which, for perspective, is where the U.S. was in 2001. However, in addition to the untapped upside as it continues to expand its core search business, what has me most excited about Baidu is where it's heading next. Thanks to its cash-cow search business, the company has generated mountains of capital to invest in other ventures in search of its next big growth driver. One way it's doing that is by establishing Baidu Capital, which is a $3 billion fund that will invest in new technologies to drive growth in the future. Overall, the company has a slew of compelling projects in the works, including investments in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and online-to-offline, which will allow users to buy things directly from Baidu's platform via their Baidu Wallet accounts. These investments are already beginning to pay dividends. CEO Robin Li noted recently that in 2017, the company is starting to gain momentum on its strategic evolution from a "mobile-first to an AI-first company," and that its "already seeing the powerful benefits of AI bear fruit across our existing platform." As this transformation continues, it has the potential to reaccelerate the company's growth rate. With plenty of search-driven growth ahead of it on its home turf and compelling upside potential from new technologies in development, Baidu has the look of a company that could deliver Google-like returns in the years ahead. Image source: Getty Images. Building a brighter online retail future Rich Duprey (Shopify): E-commerce accounted for 13.3% of all retail sales in the fourth quarter of 2016, according to the latest data from the Commerce Dept. Of the $929 billion in retail sales registered between October and December (adjusted for items not normally bought online, like cars, gas, and restaurants), internet retailers enjoyed a better than 14% gain in sales. While that's the smallest gain recorded since 2014, it's still well ahead of how the overall retail industry is performing. That indicates e-commerce platform provider Shopify has a lot of growth potential ahead of it still by providing small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with a vehicle for establishing web-based and mobile storefronts. It gives them the simple, seamless, and secure platform to sell their goods and services expected by consumers who want to be able to transact anywhere, anytime, on any device. Shopify's stock has more than tripled in value over the past year on the strength of what CFO Russ Jones says is the e-commerce platform provider becoming the "de facto platform for sellers." That kind of dominance has even reportedly attracted the notice of eBay, which was rumored to be considering buying Shopify. While it seems doubtful that would happen considering it shed payment service PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL), it does indicate the kind of mindshare Shopify is generating and how integral it is becoming to buying and selling goods online. That's the kind of positioning Google had back in the day as it sought to upend the dominant players at the time. While Google is so much more than just a search engine today, there's no telling where Shopify might find itself tomorrow. After all, no one anticipated Google morphing into Alphabet and owning not only search, but also Android, AdSense, mapping software, YouTube, Google Play, and more. Shopify may be content to simply be the biggest, baddest e-commerce platform available, and that's fine, because even that niche represents a huge, multibillion-dollar opportunity that could one day see internet sales overtake sales at bricks and mortar retailers.

Eric Risberg/AP hide caption toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Dan Howley tries out the Google Daydream View virtual-reality headset and controller on Oct. 4, 2016, following a product event in San Francisco. This week, Google announced plans for stand-alone VR goggles that won't need to be attached to a PC or smartphone. Eric Risberg/AP Google offered a glimpse of how it sees the future at its annual developer's conference this week. And it involves a lot of blending between the virtual and the real worlds using augmented and virtual reality. Google is calling that blend immersive computing. Clay Bavor, who heads up Google's AR and VR division, says it's all part of a future where the virtual and real worlds blur. "Virtual reality can make you really feel transported somewhere else," Bavor says. "Augmented reality can bring kind of digital information into your environment and make it really seem as if it's there in the real world." When it comes to virtual reality other companies like Facebook's Oculus Rift, Sony VR, and HTC Vive have aimed for the expensive high end. But Google has actually reached more people with its $15 Cardboard viewer that attaches to smartphones. This week it announced plans for a more advanced VR headset. Google will be the first major company to release stand-alone VR goggles. "Unlike systems that you have to connect to a PC or where you take your smartphone and insert it into a VR headset, everything you need for VR is contained right in the headset itself," Bavor says. Google is partnering with HTC and Lenovo to make the headset. New #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC. #io17 pic.twitter.com/7TpYPJGEdU— Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google is also beefing up its augmented reality technology. First, there's Google Lens. The technology pulls together Google's search technology and lays it over photos from the real world. You can point your camera at a flower and the search engine will identify it for you. Point the camera at a book and it will give you reviews and information about the author. Google Lens will initially be available through Google Assistant and Google Photos. Google also announced what it's calling Visual Positioning Service or VPS. Bavor says imagine going to a large store. "You go to Lowe's and you need to find this very specific bolt. You can pull up the Lowe's app — do a search for it and then your phone will walk you step by step to the exact aisle and shelf where that bolt is," he says. Bavor says this technology may also be especially useful to the blind. But, it won't initially be widely available. It will be incorporated into a new ASUS smartphone. There's a lot of competition among the big tech companies to advance these immersive technologies — Facebook, Microsoft and Sony are competitors and analysts say Apple is likely to jump into the fray. But Google has some advantages, says Greg Sterling, a contributing editor at Search Engine Land. "Because it's got hardware, it's got a massive consumer audience and brand and it's got all this data and software expertise. And really none of the other players have all those pieces," he says. 13.7: Cosmos And Culture Are We Turning Into Machines? Google is adding both AR and VR capabilities to its Chrome browser. You'll be able to switch between VR experiences quickly and of course use Google's database to identify items in the real world. For example, you could point your augmented reality-enabled phone at a restaurant and review would pop up on the screen from Google search. But not all of Google's efforts may be destined to succeed. Take that stand-alone VR headset. Google's new VR goggles might not appeal to either high-end VR fans or the low-end Google Cardboard fans. Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, says the high-end users will spend money for the power of an Oculus Rift and the low-end market may not want to spend much at all. Google says its headset might cost the same as an Oculus Rift, but will be cheaper because you don't have to buy a high-end computer too. That could be too much, Blau says. All Tech Considered Google Glass Didn't Disappear. You Can Find It On The Factory Floor "Because you really have to want to be an extended VR user, if you will, if you're going to invest more than $500 into one of these systems," he says. And Google has had previous failures with augmented reality. Google Glass was a flop with consumers because the company didn't think through the privacy implications. Google's VR headset will be out the end of this year and so will new augmented reality-capable smartphones. There's still no word on price.

Alarm.com releases its actions for Google Assistant, including locking doors and disarming security systems Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/20 5:01am PDTMay 20, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Google News Actions on Google, the platform that makes it possible for third-party developers and services to integrate with Google Assistant, has been seeing a lot of success lately with important companies jumping on board like LG, GE, Logitech, and more. The newest addition though might be one of the most interesting — at least if your name is Artem Russakovskii (all hail our geeky leader!) and you have dozens of lights, locks, sensors, and cameras all working within the Alarm.com system. Alarm.com users will be able to add their system under Google Assistant's Assistant apps section or by saying, "OK Google, talk to Alarm.com." Once authenticated with their credentials, they have a lot of options at their disposal. They can change the thermostat temperature, control individual or grouped lights, lock and unlock doors and garage doors, arm and disarm their security system, and inquire about the state of any lock, light, or thermostat. Given the security concerns over disarming your system or unlocking your doors, Alarm.com provides an optional (which I think should be mandatory) setting for a 4-digit PIN code that you'll have to say to perform these potentially compromising actions. As you can imagine, Artem is ecstatic about the feature — though he would have preferred a direct smart home partner integration with Assistant instead of this third-party solution — especially because the Alexa integration for Alarm.com doesn't offer any unlock or disarm functionality. However, Alarm.com tells us that this will soon be remedied and the options will come to Alexa as well.

I want the Google Assistant to carry out tasks without having me talk to another half-baked 3rd party assistant. This is just as worse as Alexa's "10,000 skills" on the Echo that you have to memorize to use. If I have to talk to another service, I won't use it. Which is why I have never used any of the "talk to blah" third party services on Google Home since launch. Jared Eberle While I completely agree, Google has made this quite usable with shortcuts. I use Autovoice all the time now that there is shortcuts. Taco Monster Yeah, the shortcuts make it work very well. Artem Russakovskii That's true, but it's still better than no integration, and as an alarm.com user, I've been waiting for Assistant to be able to control it for months. jaycemiskel I have an Alexa and alarm.com. You're right that you can't disarm or unlock, but it does have functionality to lock your doors and arm your system. I do it all of the time. The article is somewhat incorrect. I want direct integration though. That ask alarm.com crap is annoying Taco Monster As mentioned above, you can set up shortcuts to make it a bit more palatable. Works well with my August lock. jaycemiskel Thanks. That definitely is helpful. Sucks setting it all up, but it's going to save me a lot of time in the future. Artem Russakovskii Problem is there are no variables supported by shortcuts, so you'd have to program every single device you have and every variant of the command (lock, unlock, turn on, turn off, etc). May be OK for someone with 1-2 devices, but I have dozens, so it wouldn't scale for me. Maybe I'd set it up only for the most commonly used commands, but I'm hoping Google can make shortcuts and NLP in general a lot more powerful. Right now, it's more frustrating than useful. Taco Monster I think you'll forever be an outlier on these things 😉. But yes, if catering to people like you makes the experience better for everyone, then that's obviously a great thing to get behind. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, that part is wrong, I'll get it fixed up. Btw in my tests, surprisingly, Alexa works really well, and Assistant works like absolute crap. jaycemiskel Yeah Alexa works well. I agree, just started using it with assistant today and it seems like it's more finicky than with Alexa. usnmustanger Yeah, I tested this alarm.com assistant for 10 minutes, and 90% of the time the alarm.com assistant couldn't understand what I was saying, asking me to repeat myself. I was able to successfully arm my alarm system exactly once, and was never able to disarm it by voice. Talk about half-baked... Artem Russakovskii I'm talking to Alarm.com PR now, so I'll let them know we're not quite as happy with Assistant integration compared to Alexa. Matt Colontrelle Been holding out on Google home but just installed am alarm.com system might just get one now trying the whole automated route in the house MarcVH So you can do "arm stay" with this but not "arm away". I'm guessing this is a deliberate limitation but I'm not sure I understand why. C Lo My only concern with using a system such as Google Home is the ability of these systems to mistaken someone else's voice for mine. Im glad to see the mistaken voice reducing down to 4.9% however, I'd like to see it as close to zero as possible. Once it gets in the 1% range, I will try it. Artem Russakovskii Why though? Disarming/unlocking is protected by a PIN. As for the 4.9% figure, I am not sure it has anything to do with recognizing an individual voice but rather recognizing what was said correctly. I don't think if you trained your voice for personalized results that it would recognize someone else as you 4.9% of the time...

Google Home Updates Announced At Google I/O 2017. May 20, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) At Google I/O 2017, several Google Home updates were announced and it seems that Google is all set to beat Amazon Echo. From free calling to phones in the US and Canada to business expansion in several other regions, Google is aiming to widen the reach of its smart speaker that runs on artificial intelligence system, Google Assistant’s support. Here’s what Google has announced for the Home during its I/O 2017 conference. Beating Amazon Echo with Free Calling If you own an Amazon Echo, you are probably calling other Echo devices only, but Google is taking the Home way more ahead by allowing users to call landline and mobile phones. The service will be limited to the phones in the US and Canada and users from the other regions will have to wait for the availability a little longer. The company has not even given any release date for this update, but when it goes live, Home users will be able to ask the assistant to go through the contact lists and dial the number. Proactive Assistance If Amazon is bringing notifications, we will also bring. This was probably the thought behind Google’s announcement at I/O 2017 about “proactive assistance.” But Google is probably not bringing the notifications in the same way Amazon is doing with Alexa. According to Google, the notification features are going to be very basic, at least at the time of launch. Of course, the company would want to keep some improvements under wrap for the future. So, what proactive assistance is going to do is notifying you about traffic alerts, flight delays and it will also remind you of things you want to be reminded of. Another good news is that you will be able to create calendar entries and set reminders. Support for Streaming Services Google doesn’t want to be left behind in the competition with Amazon Echo, and as a part of Google’s I/O 2017 announcements, the company confirmed that the Google Home will support Spotify, CBS All Access, HBO Now and several other streaming services after the upcoming updates. Currently, the device supports Netflix and Spotify Premium. Another major announcement by Google suggests that Google Home will support Bluetooth audio. Support for Bluetooth is obviously a surprising move because the company didn’t ship Home with Bluetooth audio support, but now it claims that the users can connect Bluetooth-enabled audio devices to the Home soon after the update goes live. Going Beyond Voice Commands After the updates announced at I/O 2017 go live, the Home will not only respond to you with AI voice, it will in fact show things on TV. Google confirmed that the search results can now be shown on TV. For example, if you are asking the Home to show the list of flights available between two cities, it will be able to show you the same on the connected TV. The same can be done with the commands such as “show me the calendar” or “show me some good hotels.” Google is surely breaking the boundaries and giving true meanings to a smart device for smart homes. Just imagine how easy and exciting it would be to plan a holiday or a weekend trip with family or friends when everyone can see the suggested directions, hotels, restaurants on the big screen and can finalize the plan mutually. Google Home Update Release This summer, Google is planning to expand its business with Google’s Home speaker in five countries including Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan and France. The company said that the features will be pretty limited at the time of the Home update launch. The company did not share any specific release date for these updates, so instead of relying on rumors, waiting for the official announcement is the best thing fans can do at this point of time. The updates may not look very ground-breaking to you, but it is very clear that soon Google Home will be capable of doing things many of us never expected.

Asus Zenwatch 3 Android Wear 2.0 Update Release Not Happening Before This Month End. May 20, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 2 Comments Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) If you are waiting for the Android Wear 2.0 update on Asus Zenwatch 3 smartwatch, you will need to wait for some more time. Asus messed up things on Twitter that led many fans and media houses to believe that the company rolled out Android Wear 2.0 update on May 15. Publications started spreading news suggesting readers to update their Zenwatch 3 to the latest version of the Android OS, but in reality, there is no such update available. On Twitter, the company confirmed that they made a mistake and the much awaited update is scheduled for the month end. After several reports about Zenphone 3 getting Android Wear 2.0 update, many fans on Twitter started asking Asus UK about the update release. The company then cleared the air by responding to a fan saying that “we were mistaken.” Why The Android Wear 2.0 Update Matters? The Zenwatch 3 was launched in 2016 and since then the watch is running on the old version of Android Wear. This year in February, Google launched the biggest update for its Android OS for wearables. The updated smartwatch OS was available only on the two LG watches at the time of launch and was scheduled to arrive on many watches. Since the announcement, Asus Zenwatch 3 users were waiting for the software release because the update brings significant changes and improvements. The biggest change in Android Wear system is that Zenwatch 3 users will get standalone apps on their smartwatch. Android Wear 2.0 allows users to keep their phones away by not having to tether phone or synchronize with cloud. Another thing that makes this update more exciting is the arrival of more standalone apps. According to Google, the developers are working on hundreds of apps, and the best thing is that people won’t miss the existing apps that support previous version of Android Wear system. The Android Wear 2.0 will add Google Assistant to Zenwatch 3 as the new version of the OS supports the AI based voice assistant. So, you won’t have to take out your phone to set reminders or to find information, by pressing the button and saying “Ok Google,” you can activate the assistant and can ask questions or give voice commands. The users of the Asus Zenwatch 3 know the real pain of Google notification cards covering the watch faces, making the display look cluttered. With the Android Wear 2.0 update for Asus Zenwatch 3, things will work in a different way. It is completely understandable that the delay in Android Wear 2.0 release on Zenwatch 3 has left many fans disheartened, but the good thing is that it is finally happening this month. Asus Discontinuing Zenwatch Products? Meanwhile, the Taiwanese company is reportedly planning to discontinue Zenwatch series due to poor sales. Some sources from the manufacturer claim that Asus is shipping only 5-6k units per month across its Zenwatch product line. The company will reportedly leave the Android Wear business as the sales are not as per its expectations. However, Asus has not confirmed anything about the same, the comments from the company are still awaited. If the rumor about Asus discontinuing Zenwatch production turns out to be true, there are chances that the company will follow the footsteps of Samsung and Motorola, and introduce its own platform like Samsung’s Tizen. No matter whether Asus introduces a new platform or discontinues production of Zenwatch, backing away from Google’s Android Wear platform will surely harm Google to some extent. The Asus Zenwatch 3 and other watches from the product line are some of the most affordable smartwatches available till date and bringing the Android Wear 2.0 support will probably help the company boost its sales in the almost saturated smartwatch market. Other than the tweet, Asus has not shared any specific release details about the update. Staff Writer; Corey Shaw Have any Tech Tips? News? Hit up our Tech Guru at; CoreyS@ThyBlackMan.com.

Pricey Housing Discourages Having Kids - 05/19/2017 - Yves Smith Notes From an Emergency: Tech Feudalism Posted on May 19, 2017 by Yves Smith Yves here. This is a wide-ranging, lively, sobering talk about the implications of tech feudalism and what we can do about it. By Maciej Cegłowski,  a painter and computer guy who lives  in San Francisco and runs a bookmarking site called Pinboard. Originally published at Idle Words This is the text version of a talk I gave on May 10, 2017, at the re:publica conference in Berlin. The good part about naming a talk in 2017 ‘Notes from an Emergency’ is that there are so many directions to take it. The emergency I want to talk about is the rise of a vigorous ethnic nationalism in Europe and America. This nationalism makes skillful use of online tools, tools that we believed inherently promoted freedom, to advance an authoritarian agenda. Depending on where you live, the rise of this new right wing might be nothing new. In the United States, our moment of shock came last November, with the election of Donald Trump. The final outcome of that election was: 65.8 million for Clinton 63.0 million for Trump This was the second time in sixteen years that the candidate with fewer votes won the American Presidency. There is a bug in the operating system of our democracy, one of the many ways that slavery still casts its shadow over American politics. But however tenuously elected, Trump is in the White House, and our crisis has become your crisis. Not just because America is a superpower, or because the forces that brought Trump to power are gaining ground in Europe, but because the Internet is an American Internet. Facebook is the dominant social network in Europe, with 349 million monthly active users. Google has something like 94% of market share for search in Germany. The servers of Europe are littered with the bodies of dead and dying social media sites. The few holdouts that still exist, like Xing, are being crushed by their American rivals. In their online life, Europeans have become completely dependent on companies headquartered in the United States. And so Trump is in charge in America, and America has all your data. This leaves you in a very exposed position. US residents enjoy some measure of legal protection against the American government. Even if you think our intelligence agencies are evil, they’re a lawful evil. They have to follow laws and procedures, and the people in those agencies take them seriously. But there are no such protections for non-Americans outside the United States. The NSA would have to go to court to spy on me; they can spy on you anytime they feel like it. This is an astonishing state of affairs. I can’t imagine a world where Europe would let itself become reliant on American cheese, or where Germans could only drink Coors Light. In the past, Europe has shown that it’s capable of identifying a vital interest and moving to protect it. When American aerospace companies were on the point of driving foreign rivals out of business, European governments formed the Airbus consortium, which now successfully competes with Boeing. A giant part of the EU budget goes to subsidize farming, not because farming is the best use of resources in a first-world economy, but because farms are important to national security, to the landscape, to national identity, social stability, and a shared sense of who we are. But when it comes to the Internet, Europe doesn’t put up a fight. It has ceded the ground entirely to American corporations. And now those corporations have to deal with Trump. How hard do you think they’ll work to defend European interests? The Feudal Internet The status quo in May 2017 looks like this: There are five Internet companies—Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook. Together they have a market capitalization just under 3 trillion dollars. Bruce Schneier has called this arrangement the feudal Internet. Part of this concentration is due to network effects, but a lot of it is driven by the problem of security. If you want to work online with any measure of convenience and safety, you must choose a feudal lord who is big enough to protect you. These five companies compete and coexist in complex ways. Apple and Google have a duopoly in smartphone operating systems. Android has 82% of the handset market, iOS has 18%. Google and Facebook are on their way to a duopoly in online advertising. Over half of the revenue in that lucrative ($70B+) industry goes to them, and the two companies between them are capturing all of the growth (16% a year). Apple and Microsoft have a duopoly in desktop operating systems. The balance is something like nine to one in favor of Windows, not counting the three or four people who use Linux on the desktop, all of whom are probably at this conference. Three companies, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, dominate cloud computing. AWS has 57% adoption, Azure has 34%. Google has 15%. Outside of China and Russia, Facebook and LinkedIn are the only social networks at scale. LinkedIn has been able to survive by selling itself to Microsoft. And outside of Russia and China, Google is the world’s search engine. That is the state of the feudal Internet, leaving aside the court jester, Twitter, who plays an important but ancillary role as a kind of worldwide chat room. Google in particular has come close to realizing our nightmare scenario from 1998, a vertically integrated Internet controlled by a single monopoly player. Google runs its own physical network, builds phone handsets, develops a laptop and phone operating system, makes the world’s most widely-used browser, runs a private DNS system, PKI certificate authority, has photographed nearly all the public spaces in the world, and stores much of the world’s email. But because it is run by more sympathetic founders than Bill Gates, because it builds better software than early Microsoft did, and because it built up a lot of social capital during its early “don’t be evil” period, we’ve given it a pass. Security It’s not clear that anyone can secure large data collections over time. The asymmetry between offense and defense may be too great. If defense at scale is possible, the only way to do it is by pouring millions of dollars into hiring the best people to defend it. Data breaches at the highest levels have shown us that the threats are real and ongoing. And for every breach we know about, there are many silent ones that we won’t learn about for years. A successful defense, however, just increases the risk. Pile up enough treasure behind the castle walls and you’ll eventually attract someone who can climb them. The feudal system makes the Internet more brittle, ensuring that when a breach finally comes, it will be disastrous. Each of the big five companies, with the important exception of Apple, has made aggressive user surveillance central to its business model. This is a dilemma of the feudal internet. We seek protection from these companies because they can offer us security. But their business model is to make us more vulnerable, by getting us to surrender more of the details of our lives to their servers, and to put more faith in the algorithms they train on our observed behavior. These algorithms work well, and despite attempts to convince us otherwise, it’s clear they work just as well in politics as in commerce. So in our eagerness to find safety online, we’ve given this feudal Internet the power to change our offline world in unanticipated and scary ways. Globalism These big five companies operate on a global scale, and partly because they created the industries they now dominate, they enjoy a very lax regulatory regime. Everywhere outside the United States and EU, they are immune to government oversight, and within the United Statesl the last two administrations have played them with a light touch. The only meaningful attempt to regulate surveillance capitalism has come out of the European Union. Thanks to their size and reach, the companies have become adept at stonewalling governments and evading attempts at regulation or oversight. In many cases, this evasion is noble. You don’t want Bahrain or Poland to be able to subpoena Facebook and get the names of people organizing a protest rally. In other cases, it’s purely self-serving. Uber has made a sport of evading all authority, foreign and domestic, in order to grow. Good or bad, the lesson these companies have drawn is the same: they need only be accountable to themselves. But their software and algorithms affect the lives of billions of people. Decisions about how this software works are not under any kind of democratic control. In the best case, they are being made by idealistic young people in California with imperfect knowledge of life in a faraway place like Germany. In the worst case, they are simply being read out of a black-box algorithm trained on God knows what data. This is a very colonial mentality! In fact, it’s what we fought our American War of Independence over, a sense of grievance that decisions that affected us were being made by strangers across the ocean. Today we’re returning the favor to all of Europe. Facebook, for example, has only one manager in Germany to deal with every publisher in the country. One! The company that is dismantling the news industry in Germany doesn’t even care enough to send a proper team to manage the demolition. Denmark has gone so far as to appoint an ambassador to the giant tech companies, an unsettling but pragmatic acknowledgement of the power relationship that exists between the countries of Europe and Silicon Valley. So one question (speaking now as an EU citizen): how did we let this happen? We used to matter! We used to be the ones doing the colonizing! We used to be a contender! How is it that some dopey kid in Palo Alto gets to decide the political future of the European Union based on what they learned at big data boot camp? Did we lose a war? The lack of accountability isn’t just troubling from a philosophical perspective. It’s dangerous in a political climate where people are pushing back at the very idea of globalization. There’s no industry more globalized than tech, and no industry more vulnerable to a potential backlash. China and Russia show us that the Internet need not be a world-wide web, that it can be subverted and appropriated by the state. By creating a political toolkit for authoritarian movements, the American tech giants may be putting their own future at risk. Irreality Given this scary state of the world, with ecological collapse just over the horizon, and a population sharpening its pitchforks, an important question is how this globalized, unaccountable tech industry sees its goals. What does it want? What will all the profits be invested in? What is the plan? The honest answer is: rocket ships and immortality. I wish I was kidding. The best minds in Silicon Valley are preoccupied with a science fiction future they consider it their manifest destiny to build. Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk are racing each other to Mars. Musk gets most of the press, but Bezos now sells $1B in Amazon stock a year to fund Blue Origin. Investors have put over $8 billion into space companies over the past five years, as part of a push to export our problems here on Earth into the rest of the Solar System. As happy as I am to see Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos fired into space, this does not seem to be worth the collapse of representative government. Our cohort of tech founders is feeling the chill breath of mortality as they drift into middle age. And so part of what is driving this push into space is a more general preoccupation with ‘existential risk’. Musk is persuaded that we’re living in a simulation, and he or a fellow true believer has hired programmers to try to hack it. Peter Thiel, our most unfortunate German import, has built a survival retreat for himself in New Zealand. Sam Altman hoards gold in Big Sur. OpenAI, a religious cult thinly disguised as a research institution, has received $1B in funding to forestall the robot rebellion. The biggest existential risk, of course, is death, so a lot of money is going to make sure that our big idea men don’t expire before the world has been received the full measure of their genius. Google Ventures founded the very secretive life extension startup Calico, with $1.5B dollars in funding. Google loses $4B a year on its various “moon shots”, which include life extension. They employ Ray Kurzweil, who believes we’re still on track for immortality by 2045. Larry Ellison has put $370M to anti-aging research, as anybody would want to live in a world with an immortal Larry Ellison. Our plutocrats are eager to make death an opt-out experience. Now, I’m no fan of death. I don’t like the time commitment, or the permanence. A number of people I love are dead and it has strained our relationship. But at the same time, I’m not convinced that a civilization that is struggling to cure male-pattern baldness is ready to take on the Grim Reaper. If we’re going to worry about existential risk, I would rather we start by addressing the two existential risks that are indisputably real—nuclear war and global climate change—and working our way up from there. But real problems are messy. Tech culture prefers to solve harder, more abstract problems that haven’t been sullied by contact with reality. So they worry about how to give Mars an earth-like climate, rather than how to give Earth an earth-like climate. They debate how to make a morally benevolent God-like AI, rather than figuring out how to put ethical guard rails around the more pedestrian AI they are introducing into every area of people’s lives. The tech industry enjoys tearing down flawed institutions, but refuses to put work into mending them. Their runaway apparatus of surveillance and manipulation earns them a fortune while damaging everything it touches. And all they can think about is the cool toys they’ll get to spend the profits on. The message that’s not getting through to Silicon Valley is one that your mother taught you when you were two: you don’t get to play with the new toys until you clean up the mess you made. The circumstances that have given the tech industry all this power will not last long. There is a limited time in which our small caste of tech nerds will have the power to make decisions that shape the world. By wasting the talents and the energies of our brightest people on fantasy role play, we are ceding the future to a more practical group of successors, some truly scary people who will take our tools and use them to advance a very different agenda. To recap: the Internet has centralized into a very few hands. We have an extremely lucrative apparatus of social control, and it’s being run by chuckleheads. The American government is also being run by chuckleheads. The question everybody worries about is, what happens when these two groups of chuckleheads join forces? The Winter For many Americans, the election was a moment of profound shock. It wasn’t just Trump’s policies that scared us. It was the fact that this unserious, cruel, vacant human being had been handed the power of the American presidency. Scariest to me was how little changed. No one in the press or in social media had the courage to say “we fucked up.” Pundits who were stunned by the election result still made confident predictions about what would happen next, as if they had any claim to predictive power. After the election both Facebook and Google looked at the mountains of data they had collected on everyone, looked at the threats the Trump Administration was making—to deport 11 million people, to ban Muslims from entering the country—and said to themselves, “we got this.” The people who did worry were tech workers. For a moment, we saw some political daylight appear between the hundreds of thousands of people who work in the tech sector, and the small clique of billionaires who run it. While the latter filed in to a famously awkward meeting with Trump and his children at the top of his golden tower, the former began organizing in opposition, including signing a simple but powerful pledge to resign rather than help Trump fulfill one of his key campaign promises: barring Muslims from the United States. This pledge was a small gesture, but it represented the first collective action by tech workers around a political agenda that went beyond technology policy, and the first time I had ever seen tech workers come out in open defiance of management. A forest of new organizations sprung up. I started one, too, called Tech Solidarity, and started traveling around the country and holding meetings with tech workers in big cities. I had no idea what I was doing, other than trying to use a small window of time to organize and mobilize our sleepy industry. That feeling of momentum continued through when Trump took office. The Women’s Marchin January brought five million people out onto the streets. America is not used to mass protests. To see the streets of our major cities fill with families, immigrants, in many cases moms and daughters and grandmothers marching together, that was a sight to take your breath away. Hard on the heels of it came the travel ban, an executive order astonishing not just in its cruelty—families were split at airports; in one case a mom was not allowed to breastfeed her baby—but in its ineptitude. For a week or two lawyers were camped out at airports, working frantically, sleeping little, with spontaneous efforts to bring them supplies, get them funding, to do anything to help. We held a rally in San Francisco that raised thirty thousand dollars from a room of a hundred people. Some of the organizations we were helping couldn’t even attend, they were too busy at the airport. It didn’t matter. The tech companies did all they could to not get involved. Facebook has a special ‘safety check‘ feature for exactly this kind of situation, but never thought of turning it on at airports. Public statements out of Silicon Valley were so insipid as to be comical. Employees, however, were electrified. It looked like not only visitors but permanent residents would be barred from the United States. Google employees staged a walkoutwith the support of their management; Facebook (not wishing to be left behind) had its own internal protest a couple of days later, but kept it a secret. Every time the employees pushed, management relented. Suddenly top executives were going on the record against the travel ban. People briefly even got mad at Elon Musk, normally a darling of the tech industry, for his failure to resign from the President’s advisory council. The silent majority of tech employees had begun to mobilize. And then… nothing happened. This tech workforce, which had gotten a taste of its own power, whose smallest efforts at collective action had produced immediate results, who had seen just how much sway they held, went back to work. The worst of Trump’s travel ban was blocked by the court, and we moved on. With the initial shock of Trump in office gone, we now move from crisis to crisis, but without a plan or a shared positive goal. The American discomfort with prolonged, open disagreement has set in. When I started trying to organize people in November, my theory was that tech workers were the only group that had leverage over the tech giants. My reasoning went like this: being monopolies or near-monopolies, these companies are impervious to public pressure. Boycotts won’t work, since opting out of a site like Google means opting out of much of modern life. Several of these companies are structured (unusually for American corporations) in such a way that the board can’t control the majority of votes. At Google and Facebook, for example, the ultimate say goes to the founders. And since Google and Facebook are the major online publishing outlets, it’s unlikely that the press would ever criticize them, even if journalists were capable of that kind of sustained attention. So that leaves just one point of leverage: employees. Tech workers are hard to find, expensive to hire, take a long time to train, and can have their pick of jobs. Tech companies are small compared to other industries, relying heavily on automation. If even a few dozen workers on an ops team acted in concert, they would have the power to shut down a tech giant like Google. All they had to do was organize around a shared agenda. Workers seemed receptive to the argument, but confused about how they could make collective action a reality. Trade unions in the United States have been under attack for decades. There is almost no union culture in technology. Our tech workers are passive and fatalistic. So here I am in Europe, wondering, what on Earth can we do? And I keep coming back to this idea of connecting the tech industry to reality. Bringing its benefits to more people, and bringing the power to make decisions to more people. Closing the Loop After Communism collapsed in Poland, I started visiting the country every eight months or so. Even in the darkest period of the 1990’s, it was striking to see people’s material standard of living improve. Suddenly people had cars, phones, appliances. These gains were uneven but broad. Even farmers and retirees, though they were the hardest hit, had access to consumer goods that weren’t available before. You could see the change in homes and in public spaces. It was no longer necessary for office workers in Kraków to change their shirts at lunchtime because of soot in the air. The tap water in Warsaw went from light brown to a pleasant pale yellow. For all the looting, corruption, and inefficiency of privatization, enough of the new wealth got through that the overall standard of living went up. Living standards in Poland in 2010 had more than doubled from 1990. In the same time period, in the United States, I’ve seen a whole lot of nothing. Despite fabulous technical progress, practically all of it pioneered in our country, there’s been a singular failure to connect our fabulous prosperity with the average person. A study just out shows that for the median male worker in the United States, the highest lifetime wages came if you entered the workforce in 1967. That is astonishing. People born in 1942 had better lifetime earnings prospects than people entering the workforce today. You can see this failure to connect with your own eyes even in a rich place like Silicon Valley. There are homeless encampments across the street from Facebook headquarters. California has a larger GDP than France, and at the same time has the highest poverty rate in America, adjusted for cost of living. Not only did the tech sector fail to build up the communities around it, but it’s left people worse off than before, by pricing them out of the places they grew up. Walk the length of Market Street (watch your step!) in San Francisco and count the shuttered store fronts. Take Caltrain down to San Jose, and see if you can believe that it is the richest city in the United States, per capita. The massive increase in wealth has not connected with a meaningful way with average people’s lives even in the heart of tech country, let alone in the forgotten corners of the country. The people who run Silicon Valley identify with progressive values. They’re not bad people. They worry about these problems just like we do; they want to help. So why the failure to do anything? Like T.S. Eliot wrote: Between the idea And the reality Between the motion And the act Falls the Shadow As I said earlier, the tech industry hates messy problems. We’d rather dream up new problems we can solve from scratch. One reason nothing happens is a culture of tax evasion. There’s a folk belief in American business that if you pay full taxes, you’re not doing your fiduciary duty, and your board will fire you. Apple now has a quarter trillion dollars offshore that it refuses to put into direct productive use in the United States. Apple boasts that its products are designed in California—they will sell you a $300 book called Designed By Apple In California. But they do their damndest to make sure that California never sees a penny of their overseas profits. You in the EU are all too familiar with this brand of tax evasion. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft have all been under investigation or in court on charges of evading European taxes. Another reason good intentions don’t translate is that capitalism, especially venture capital, doesn’t work very well when there is vast wealth inequality. The richest 20 people in tech control a fortune of half a trillion dollars in personal wealth, more than the GDP of Sweden. This small subculture of wealthy technophiles promotes investment into luxury goods for rich people, or into “mom as a service” types of companies that cater to spoiled workaholics in the tech industry. And so we end up with things like a $120M juice squeezer, or three startups competing to deliver organic baby food. Silicon Valley brings us the worst of two economic systems: the inefficiency of a command economy coupled with the remorselessness of laissez-faire liberalism. One reason it’s been difficult to organize workers in the tech industry is that people have a hard time separating good intentions from results. But we have to be cold-blooded about this. Tech companies are run by a feckless leadership accountable to no one, creating a toolkit for authoritarianism while hypnotized by science-fiction fantasy. There are two things we have to do immediately. The first is to stop the accelerating process of tracking and surveillance before it can do any more harm to our institutions. The danger facing us is not Orwell, but Huxley. The combo of data collection and machine learning is too good at catering to human nature, seducing us and appealing to our worst instincts. We have to put controls on it. The algorithms are amoral; to make them behave morally will require active intervention. The second thing we need is accountability. I don’t mean that I want Mark Zuckerberg’s head on a pike, though I certainly wouldn’t throw it out of my hotel room if I found it there. I mean some mechanism for people whose lives are being brought online to have a say in that process, and an honest debate about its tradeoffs. I’m here today because I believe the best chance to do this is in Europe. The American government is not functional right now, and the process of regulatory capture is too far gone to expect any regulations limiting the tech giants from either party. American tech workers have the power to change things, but not the desire. Only Europe has the clout and the independence to regulate these companies. You can already point to regulatory successes, like forcing Facebook to implement hard delete on user accounts. That feature was added with a lot of grumbling, but because of the way Facebook organizes its data, they had to make it work the same for all users. So a European regulation led to a victory for privacy worldwide. We can do this again. Here are some specific regulations I would like to see the EU impose: A strict 30 day time limit on storing behavioral data. The right to opt out of data collection while continuing to use services. A ban on the sale or transfer of behavioral data, including to third-party ad networks. A requirement that advertising be targeted strictly to content, not users. With these rules in place, we would still have Google and Facebook, and they would still make a little bit of money. But we would gain some breathing room. These reforms would knock the legs out from underground political ad campaigns like we saw in Brexit, and in voter suppression efforts in the US election. They would give publishers relief in an advertising market that is currently siphoning all their earnings to Facebook and Google. And they would remove some of the incentive for consumer surveillance. The other thing I hope to see in Europe is a unionized workforce at every major tech company. Unionized workers could demand features like ephemeral group messaging at Facebook, a travel mode for social media, a truly secure Android phone, or the re-imposition of the wall between Gmail and DoubleClick data. They could demand human oversight over machine learning algorithms. They could demand non-cooperation with Trump. And I will say selfishly, if you can unionize here, it will help us unionize over there. If nothing else, we need your help and we need you to keep the pressure on the tech companies, the Trump Administration, and your own politicians and journalists, so that the disaster that happened in the United States doesn’t repeat itself in Germany. You have elections coming soon. Please learn from what happened to us. Please stay safe. And please regulate, regulate, regulate this industry, while you can. Thank you. 009902 This entry was posted in Globalization, Guest Post, Income disparity, Politics, Technology and innovation on May 19, 2017 by Yves Smith.

What popped on first reading is the description of the rise of income in Poland and the stagnation of income in the U S of A. What pops for me on seccond reading is these paragraphs about tax evasion and income inequality: >> One reason nothing happens is a culture of tax evasion. There’s a folk belief in American business that if you pay full taxes, you’re not doing your fiduciary duty, and your board will fire you. Apple now has a quarter trillion dollars offshore that it refuses to put into direct productive use in the United States. Apple boasts that its products are designed in California—they will sell you a $300 book called Designed By Apple In California. But they do their damndest to make sure that California never sees a penny of their overseas profits. You in the EU are all too familiar with this brand of tax evasion. Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft have all been under investigation or in court on charges of evading European taxes. Another reason good intentions don’t translate is that capitalism, especially venture capital, doesn’t work very well when there is vast wealth inequality. [Tax evasion isn’t just a folk belief: It is taught in U.S. law schools and in business schools, along with union busting.] Reply ↓ Jef May 19, 2017 at 10:52 am What the author inadvertently points out is that capitalism, particularly the so called consumer capitalism that we have is like a board game; It has a begining when anything is possible. A middle when a broad spectrum of players prosper and there is extra money for infrastructure and public amenities. Then an end where wealth is increasingly concentrated in fewer and fewer hands and the waste stream has taken its toll. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 11:49 am Another reason good intentions don’t translate is that capitalism, especially venture capital, doesn’t work very well when there is vast wealth inequality. The author does not understand that capitalism creates vast wealth inequality: that’s the whole point. Inequality is a feature, not a bug, and so trying to save capitalism while eliminating vast wealth inequalities is working at cross-purposes, and only one of those aims can be successful…and guess which one it always is? Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 19, 2017 at 11:56 am +100 Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 12:39 pm “capitalism creates vast wealth inequality: that’s the whole point.” Not in Adam Smith’s world, nor Henry Ford’s. True capitalists prosper by creating wealth which improves the lives of everyone around them. Crony capitalists, the ones we have now, strip wealth from others. Witness today’s bubble-and-bust cycles rather than the prior widespread economic growth. The capitalism you see today is an abomination of the original concept, just as Mnuchin’s claim to support “Glass Steagall” is an abomination. And don’t get me started on the “Affordable” Care Act, or the “Patriot” act which gutted the Constitution… P.S. The original author’s article is riddled with glaring factual errors, but he has the big picture right: it’s time to restore Antitrust Law and apply it to the internet monopolists. And restore privacy rights… and… and… it’s a long list. Start fighting now, if you want anything to happen in your lifetime! Reply ↓ Carla May 19, 2017 at 2:05 pm The author’s central thesis strikes me as correct: that Europe provides the only hope for applying any brakes whatsoever to the American tech sector. I hope someone over there is listening, as prospects here seem utterly hopeless. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 2:21 pm Freedom means people should have reasonable alternatives, choices on any product, service or ideology. Today’s internet experience lacks that freedom aspect quite a bit. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 2:42 pm Hokum. The “theory” is that it benefits everyone, but the reality is quite different. Tell me, when where these good old days, of “true” capitalism? Back when we were enslaving Africans? Back when we were hanging Wobblies? Back when we had to put nets around our factories to keep the workers from committing suicide? Please…the dictatorship of the proletariat worked out just fine in Marx’s theory, too. Reply ↓ clinical wasteman May 19, 2017 at 3:00 pm Another one for the gallery of glaring factual errors: “capitalists prosper by creating wealth”. Unless that was an epic typo for something like: “workers fail to prosper while creating wealth”. As for “the original concept” of “capitalism”, in which district of the astral plane did you find that? Apart from his anthropological sci-fi about the origins of money in “barter”, Adam Smith generally tried to write about the real world. Just like Marx, except that Smith was speaking for a different class interest, whose “moral philosopher” imagined himself to be. For that reason, “capital” and “capitalist”(n.) were important concepts for Smith and Marx alike, but “capitalism” — a sort of hybrid implying the social reality and the ideology cheerleading for it at once without ever really distinguishing between the two — is an abstraction that neither had much time for, and one that only really caught on once both were dead. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 4:01 pm Wasteman – for a start, unlike todays Cronyists, Adam Smith understood that capitalism would not function for the benefit of all unless monopolies were restrained by government: “The interest of the dealers [referring to stock owners, manufacturers, and merchants], however, in any particular branch of trade or manufacture, is always in some respects different from, and even opposite to, that of the public. To widen the market and to narrow the competition, is always the interest of the dealers. To widen the market may frequently be agreeable enough to the interest of the public; but to narrow the competition must always be against it, and can serve only to enable the dealers, by raising their profits above what they naturally would be, to levy, for their own benefit, and absurd tax upon the rest of their fellow-citizens. (Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (Amherst, New York: Prometheus Books, 1991), pages 219-220)” See here for more details: https://machineryofpolitics.wordpress.com/2012/01/04/adam-smith-on-the-crisis-of-capitalism-2/ Another interesting perspective is from J. K. Galbraith (sorry I lost the source) who pointed out that in an economy with healthy competition, profit margins are lower, but employment and wage income are necessarily higher. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 5:14 pm And pray tell, who is it who will restrain the monopolists? Our elected officials, who just so happen to be under the control of those same capitalists? Which is possible due to the vast wealth inequalities that capitalism generates…. Capitalists, almost without exception, do everything in their power to avoid competition. The idea is to make a profit and competition is antithetical to that. Lots of things are good in theory, like three-way relationships. Reality, on the other hand, feels no obligation to correspond with theory. Reply ↓ sierra7 May 19, 2017 at 9:24 pm Eventually the “sharpened pitchforks”…..the guillotine worked well during the French Revolution….we’re getting closer and closer! As far as the rest of the article you may as well as put a bag over you’re head if you pay attention to all the things that these giants of the internet (and our fed government) are doing daily. We all make choices; I choose to use the internet only for information, not banking or real personal transactions. I could give a hoot on what they gather as far as their algorithmic interpretations of my roaming the internet. I purchase extremely small and really insignificant items thru the internet. I choose not to participate wholly in contemporary life. I’m fortunate; been retired for more than 20 years; moved away from Silicon Valley and if I can help it only commune with the squirrels and other forms of nature. All the “giants” of capitalism have been eventually toppled; big steel; big coal; big rail; big anything….they all go down….eventually. And I won’t weep a tear if JBezos or others strap a rocket onto their asses an blast off into space….good riddance. Reply ↓ darthbobber May 20, 2017 at 12:15 am But the “non-monopolist” capitalism in the Victorian era had incredibly stark poverty and starvation throughout a very broad swathe of the working class, so much so that government intervention on hours and conditions of work came to be seen as a military necessity because so many young workers suffered sufficient malnutrition and disease to be unsuitable for cannon fodder. Indeed, the rise of the socialist movement took place during a much more competitive era of capitalism than we have today. Reply ↓ clinical wasteman May 20, 2017 at 1:17 am Didn’t mean to question Smith’s dislike of monopolists or the sincerity of his belief that he was writing moral philosophy throughout. In fact the earlier comment wasn’t intended polemically against him at all. His idea of “the public” is unlike mine in that it doesn’t seem to include the [90+?]% at the unlucky end of the division of labour, much less the unluckier indigenous inhabitants of “new territories” or the indentured (at best) workforce shipped out to replace them. But my point was more: 1. that Smith, Ricardo and Marx wrote about capital and capitalists, not about “capitalism” as such, and: 2. that it’s not true that capitalists — however benign and monopoly-averse they may mean to be — ever create wealth. Only labour can do that. Smith’s own articulation of a “labour theory of value” is in some ways more concise and easily explained to skeptics than Marx’s, but he also seems to have felt obliged to come up with a theory of the redeeming social utility of capitalists, because they and their immediate dependents constituted “the public” in his taxonomy of human sub-species. That doesn’t make him a fool or a bad guy, just a forthright spokesman for the “embattled” Scottish bourgeoisie of the 18th century. Most interestingly of all, there’s at least a case to be made that he theorized the “tendency of the rate of profit to fall” a century before Marx and maybe even “perpetual primitive accumulation” two centuries before Autonomist Marxists [http://www.midnightnotes.org/index2.html]. And this theory of crisis (‘Wealth of Nations’, book 1, ch. 8/9: The wages of labour/The profits of stock) was not about monopolies but about ever more futile competition for diminishing returns on “stationary” capital. The only remedy for which was for some bold East/West India Company-type Public-Private Partnership to claim “new territory”, which would be fabulously profitable for a while until everyone else caught on and the whole thing had to be started over again somewhere “newer”. As in the scramble for the Caribbean in the late 18th century, for Africa in the late 19th/1st half of the 20th, or Eastern Europe post-1989. Or, less “successfully”, the Darien Scheme [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darien_scheme] of the 1690s, but that would probably not have been one of Smith’s favourite case studies. Reply ↓ skippy May 20, 2017 at 2:24 am Ain’t that the rub – new territories – so when the physical no longer affords…. a new territory must be created… Reply ↓ Jason Dusek May 20, 2017 at 3:38 am In Smith’s world, markets and trade created wealth. In so far as capitalism means just that, great; but it seems to be loaded with something else nowadays. Smith did not support unregulated markets; nor did he embrace the idea that what was good for capital was good for society. To Smith’s thinking, the cost of goods was made up of paying for: * Labor, the input of skill and effort; * Capital, the input of equipment and goods consumed; * Rent, the provision of appropriate space and access to water, roads, harbors, &c. These three components of price more or less correspond to three classes of person in Smith’s mind, people who earn their keep primarily with labor, capital or rent. Notably, Smith felt that those who relied on capital were the only ones whose interest was opposed to social welfare as a whole. A declining society meant an increasing relative value of the assets they possessed; whereas in a declining society what can be paid for rent or wages necessarily decreases. Reply ↓ Ruben May 20, 2017 at 6:44 am Just one point of disagreement. I find it difficult to accept that those American tech companies are “internet monopolists”. Their power seems to be wildly exaggerated. The author says that without Google there is no modern life. Come on that’s preposterous. There are several choices in the internet search field. If people are lazy and don’t look around is their own fault. Same with Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft. Choices are everywhere (Cyrillic and Chinese markets are dominated by other companies) and the option to opt out as well. Of those five MS is the most dangerous because it is a bit more difficult to switch from Windows to Linux, but still, there is Ubuntu. Reply ↓ Vatch May 19, 2017 at 3:27 pm capitalism creates vast wealth inequality Not exactly. Capitalism extends or expands existing inequality. It was the development of agriculture several thousand years ago that broke the approximate egalitarianism of the hunter gatherer lifestyle. Even that had some inequality, but not much. For more information, see the early chapters of The Great Leveler, by Walter Scheidel. Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 5:23 pm Hence the “vast” part. I’m not so silly as to think that before capitalism there was not wealth inequality. But not the type where a few hundred people control more wealth than a few billion. It would seem to me, on just a gut level based on a little reading, that whereas systems like feudalism were unequal but relatively stable*, i.e. the level of inequality stayed the same generation to generation, capitalism’s dynamics have caused inequality to skyrocket, both nationally and globally. *Or at least cyclically stable, as with regular debt jubilees in Sumer. Reply ↓ Vatch May 19, 2017 at 9:21 pm 2000 years ago wealth inequality was vast in the Roman empire and in the Chinese Han empire, both of which were pre-capitalistic. You’re correct that European feudalism was less extreme than modern capitalism. That’s one of the points of Scheidel’s book: state collapse sometimes leads to greater equality, and the collapse of the Roman empire is an example. Reply ↓ darthbobber May 20, 2017 at 12:17 am Yes. Inability to produce a surplus above subsistence in the first place does indeed obviate the problem of somebody appropriating more than their share of said surplus. Reply ↓ HBE May 19, 2017 at 3:11 pm “Living standards in Poland in 2010 had more than doubled from 1990.” This sentence annoyed me to no end. Yes, the reason that is true is because every capitalist country in the world worked to smash and destroy communism without pause for its entire life and then internal and external oligarchs snatched up everything. Living standards increased over that period in Poland but so did inequality and poverty. So the country got some shiny new consumer goods (which the author seems enamored by) while the populations poverty rate continues to climb. Thank god for privatization (“Suddenly people had cars, phones, appliances” and suddenly poverty surged as well), and the end of those no good dirty commies, right? Reply ↓ vlado May 19, 2017 at 4:02 pm Yeah, it’s really a pity that author of such a well-written piece confuses GDP with living standards. If that was the case people wouldn’t vote for nationalist and populists. In any case, despite very good performance of Polish economy, its convergence to West Europe at least in terms of GDP (PPP) is questionable as the cases of Czech Republic and Slovenia show. See the article The convergence dream 25 years on in Bruegel Reply ↓ visitor May 19, 2017 at 6:04 pm There is a reason why people voted for the populist PiS and ousted the liberals who had made such a great job at bringing Poland into the EU and its “market society”. Reply ↓ Yves Smith Post authorMay 19, 2017 at 11:17 pm It is neither helpful nor logically sound to engage in black and white thinking. And you have NO basis whatsoever to dispute the claim that living standards have increased in Poland when Cegłowski has seen it happen over his regular visits there. I have a friend who is Polish (undergrad degree there, grad degree from MIT) and she also says things have improved a great deal This is clearly the case for the former East Germany, Hungary, and Czech Republic. You discredit yourself with factually unfounded, knee-jerk reactions. Reply ↓ justanotherprogressive May 19, 2017 at 10:23 am A long but brilliant article that everyone should take the time to read! I want all the techies in my family to read it because it points out some of the uneasiness even techies feel about the their industry. My favorite paragraph (although there were many close seconds): “But real problems are messy. Tech culture prefers to solve harder, more abstract problems that haven’t been sullied by contact with reality. So they worry about how to give Mars an earth-like climate, rather than how to give Earth an earth-like climate. They debate how to make a morally benevolent God-like AI, rather than figuring out how to put ethical guard rails around the more pedestrian AI they are introducing into every area of people’s lives.” Yep……. Reply ↓ Dead Dog May 19, 2017 at 11:39 am yes, well worth it. Thank you Yves (again). Reply ↓ diptherio May 19, 2017 at 12:05 pm I found it an odd mix of straight-talk and naivete. The NSA can’t spy on Americans without a warrant? Go ahead, pull the other one. Talking about the “collapse of representative government” as if we’ve ever had one. All very cute, and very silly. His suggestions for putting the brakes on are good, but insufficient. My ideas as to how to go about, “connecting the tech industry to reality. Bringing its benefits to more people, and bringing the power to make decisions to more people,” is here: http://threadingthepearls.blogspot.com/2014/11/youre-doing-it-wrong-politics-as-if.html Imagine a political party with no national platform—a party where local rank-and-file members select candidates from among themselves, and dictate the policies those candidates will support. [2] Imagine a political party whose candidates are transparent; one that guarantees every member an equal voice in shaping the actual policy proposals—and the votes—of their representatives. Imagine a political party whose focus is on empowering the rank-and-file members, instead of the charismatic con-artists we call politicians. Imagine a political party that runs on direct democracy, from bottom to top: open, transparent and accountable…. we’ll need an app…maybe two The app already exists, actually, and it’s called Loomio. Podemos uses it, along with a lot of other people: https://www.loomio.org/ Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 2:28 pm That popular vote comment is misleading as well. A previous example was given about a hypothetical House vote, where, in yes-districts, voters are split 51-49 yes (assuming that is so…lots of times, congress persons vote ‘their conscience’) and voters in no-districts are 90-10 for no. Yes votes win by one. In that case, the popular vote actually is for No. And that has nothing to do with slavery. It’s how the math works in a representative voting system. Reply ↓ PhilM May 19, 2017 at 3:32 pm Before responding to MLTPB, I’d like to voice my opinion that the OP article is thoughtful and reflects a decent level of awareness of the reality of the world, along with positive solutions that would be achievable in a polity that had the public good as its aim. As for MLTPB’s opinion on the vote, I beg to differ: it has everything to do with slavery. That’s how the numbers work in our system, which is imperial, not representative. It’s a bitch when instead of Augustus you get Caligula, but it doesn’t change the basic reality of how the system works, and has worked since Ike. In our imperial system, it does not matter to the people whether they vote, or how; it matters, occasionally, to the contestants’ position in the power structure, but nothing more than that. Here is the reality: the people in any office in our federal government—basically everyone who lives in or around Washington DC—have the same relationship to American people as they have to Russian, Chinese, or Indian people: that of serving their own interests; predation, if you will; animal husbandry, if you prefer. They will act so as to extract the maximum value consistent with not-killing-the-goose-that-lays-the-golden-eggs from every person, wherever they are located, whatever their religion, whatever their nationality, as long as they are powerless, which means everyone who is a private citizen, however rich, or a small business; everyone who is not a Forbes 500 corporation. The notion that the federal government is somehow tied to “Americans,” or even to the geographical entity now known as the USA, much less to the values expressed in the so-called “founding documents,” is a child’s bedtime story. It’s amusing that it took the election of Trump to bring this realization about; but really, that is why some of us actually voted for Trump: to rub the idiots’ noses in the reality of their political environment. (Not me, mind you; because I do not bother to vote: when I want something done, I write a check, like any experienced consumer of government services.) There is a cure, but it is not changing the election mechanism so the choice of president results from the popular vote totals in a population of 300 million. No, it means changing it so there are 1000 presidents and 100,000 representatives and 1000 supreme courts, and 1000 republics. Those are the numbers that would achieve representative government the way it was designed to function by people who knew. Alternatively, you could reduce federal taxation to 1/10th of its current level, and assign all other taxation to the township, with a population limit of 20,000. Now you would have something that is no longer imperial. But since most people since the dawn of history have lived under organizations that are imperial with perfect happiness, the appropriate course of action is not to struggle in futility for change, which would almost certainly do more harm than good, and result in an outcome that would just use up the world’s resources more swiftly in the chaos of consumption and war. The optimum course is to watch reruns of amusing sitcoms and eat good food; to gratify the animal pleasures and such pleasures of the mind as remain to aging bodies mistreated by pharmaceuticals; and to die as quickly and painlessly as the authorities permit. Reply ↓ MyLessThanPrimeBeef May 19, 2017 at 5:37 pm In our imperial system, it does not matter to the people whether they vote, or how; it matters, occasionally, to the contestants’ position in the power structure, but nothing more than that. In that case, the popular vote question is not a question anymore (with the current 1 president, instead of 1,000 setup), as you point out here: There is a cure, but it is not changing the election mechanism so the choice of president results from the popular vote totals in a population of 300 million. I have mentioned before that Rome had, at one time, 2 or 4 co-emperors. You suggest 1,000 presidents, as a solution. That’s nothing to do with slavery, except in the sense that we’re all serfs or slaves. It about making one’s voice heard within a smaller group, having someone representing you along with fewer constituents. The inherent problem of having representatives vote, versus direct voting, is still here, as in the example given above. The math scales up and down. Reply ↓ PhilM May 19, 2017 at 9:14 pm Thanks for your thoughtful response. I meant just what you did in terms of “slavery” in the sense that we all are slaves if we have no effective representation. It was a word in common use by the Founders before the revolution, who often described themselves as “slaves,” with staggering hypocrisy, considering how many of them actually held human beings as property. It was a hypocrisy frequently pointed out at the time. The math scales badly if representation is sufficiently distant to be theoretical, not actual. The math of the Founders, originally set at 1 year and 30,000 souls per “representative,” was intended so that the people voting in the house would give a true picture of the intent of their constituency. The idea was that no man would pay a tax he did not agree with. How many people could say that they would pay their taxes willingly today? And yet that was the standard of the time: pay only for those things that the majority agree is worth buying for the public good. Reply ↓ Thomas Williams May 19, 2017 at 11:04 am Nice piece: Two things to note – The Clintons, Bush & Obama presided over this mess and aided in it’s creation but the albatross of abuse is being hung on Trump. – He shares an enormous egotistical blind spot common to tech workers. He wants unionization and strength for tech workers but seems to advocate for a globalized work force. More than anything else, foreign workers are responsible for wage suppression in the US. Is he saying ‘Tech workers are special and should be pampered but others should work for $1.85 per day”? – The above points are not germaine to his central theme, which is important and well written. But it does raise questions about his values. Reply ↓ Knot Galt May 19, 2017 at 2:13 pm Agreed. Trump = Chucklehead and the shadow in T.S. Eliot’s poem Reply ↓ Anna Zimmerman May 20, 2017 at 8:07 am Nicely put, Thomas Williams. I was waiting for someone to point out how fatuous it is to exaggerate Trump’s role in what has been a general trend for decades; what a shame that I had to scroll down through so many comments before it materialised. The other great howler in what is for the most part a useful, informative article is the now routine demonization of nationalist movements. I am sick and tired of the illogicality of those who decry the evils of globalization (and this article does exactly that, albeit with regard to a specific subject) yet are unable/unwilling to distinguish between good and bad nationalism. Perhaps we should start talking about sovereignty and employment movements, which is really what motivates most people who vote for such parties? This should prove harder to attack, given that ‘nationalism’ has turned into one of those buzz words that makes the MSM run around screaming and rending their clothes.. Reply ↓ Jacobite_In_Training May 19, 2017 at 11:11 am “…Boycotts won’t work, since opting out of a site like Google means opting out of much of modern life….” Good….Opt out of modern life. Now.

There was a time I felt ‘modern life’ was the place to be….Now the older me realizes ‘modern life’ is a sham, an illusion, and a trap. A very cleverly designed trap, and one in which the cattle to be slaughtered all believe they are choosing their own destiny even as they are herded inexorably closer to the slaughterhouse. Amusingly, although my younger naive and idealistic self had a significant part to play in the great tech revolutions and evolutions through the 90’s and early 2000’s (for which I will be eternally regretful and ashamed, given how the creations we labored on have been whored out by the pimps in the oligarchy and government) I was also incredibly lucky to have grown up on a farm…and learned how to use a hoe, a hand powered washing machine, how to gather eggs…and grow things. Real things, things that can feed people. But more importantly….how to grow things like spirit and independence that do not rely on any flow of electrons to come to glorious fruition.

Reply ↓ Jacobite_In_Training May 19, 2017 at 12:13 pm I’ve had that debate before, people typically starting with the ‘well, you are posting using the Internet so you aren’t really opting out of anything’, but thats a simplistic approach, and the process of opting out is a matter of degrees – it is never a binary on/off. One can continue ‘opting out’ of aspects of society, and technology, to as extreme a position as you wish….even back to the stone age, should you choose. (sort of the ultimate boycott) Tradeoffs are inherent to the process, no argument there….just be aware that the experience of opting out is itself liberating. You realize all these shiny objects, and expensive things, and complicated processes that you have been raised to think of as critical necessities that cannot ever EVER be parted with….may not be so critical as you think. Sometimes the tradeoffs will be negative, more often – in my experience – (once you have solved the problems presented by improvising/adapting/overcoming) …you will find the ‘tradeoffs’ are a net positive. You are, of course, a creature with free will and free to do what you choose…. opt in, opt out….as you will. :) Reply ↓ Thuto May 19, 2017 at 12:59 pm Agreed, there are several gradations to this whole opting out thing.

Not a lot of open mindedness out there really though, it’s all extremes: rigid abstinence from it all, or hopeless addiction to it. I mean I understand a priori rejection of the majority of what capitalism produces (except if it’s necessary to life then well), but it is a pretty uninformed position from which to criticize (as is being addicted to it really).

One is in their consumer choices. Avoid or boycott companies that abuse their customers – hit them in their wallets. The other is in their voting and political participation push privacy rights, antitrust enforcement, etc. higher on the political agenda. It’s entirely possible to be comfortably social without “social media”. Personally, I boycott Facebook, Twitter, and (as much as possible) Google and Ebay. Google is tough because they have infiltrated the schools with Google Classroom (which has value, but do we really want an internet advertising company to be gathering data on our children?). Microsoft is tough because of the Office monopoly, but just because I have to use it at work doesn’t mean I need to pay them any money anywhere else in my life… There are also ways to buy online without using Amazon. Reply ↓ lyman alpha blob May 19, 2017 at 1:58 pm There are other search engines, browsers, email services, etc. besides those operated by the giants. DuckDuckGo, protonmail, and the Opera browser (with free built-in VPN!) work well for me. The problem is, if these other services ever do get popular enough, the tech giants will either block them by getting their stooges appointed to Federal agencies and regulating them out of existence, or buy them. I’ve been running from ISP acquisitions for years, as the little guys get bought out I have to find an even littler one. Luckily I’ve found a local ISP, GWI, that I’ve used for years now. They actually came out against the new regulations that would allow them to gather and sell their customers’ data. Such anathema will probably wind up with their CEO publicly flayed for going against all that is good and holy according to the Five Horsemen. Reply ↓ Mel May 19, 2017 at 1:26 pm There are two sides to opting out. When net neutrality is gone, then capital and market concentration will transform the internet into what cable TV is now, and nobody will need it much. Contrariwise the big tech companies are taking over the implementation of major social functions: – if you can’t vote without the internet – if you can’t spend your money without the internet – if you can’t contact your friends without the internet – if you can’t get news without the internet — this has already happened — just look at us all here. – if you can’t join a political party without liking it on your Facebook page and following it on Twitter — there are rumors that the Federal Liberal Party in Canada is exploring this. As I said somewhere else, all this would amount to an uncontracted and unspecified public/private partnership (various ones, actually) and all entered into unexamined. Time to examine them while they’re still easy to change. Reply ↓ HotFlash May 19, 2017 at 5:58 pm there are rumors that the Federal Liberal Party in Canada is exploring this. Interesting.

Reply ↓ jrs May 19, 2017 at 1:45 pm To assume that workers in ANY Industry (including tech where we know the big players have rigged the labor market against tech workers) have more power than consumers seems pretty unrealistic to me.

Or we could fight for a knowledge society, where we collectively access knowledge while protecting our identity and privacy. I vote for the latter. Google would plant a chip in every child if they could. Short of that, they have insinuated themselves in public schools, hoping that every kid in America will consummate their relationship with this giant after they graduate from k-12. See this NY Times article from last weekend: How Google Took Over the Classroom It’s hard to mitigate their reach. In a landmark student privacy law passed in California (with an even weaker version passed in my state of Oregon), they built in what I call a Google exemption clause. (8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose a duty upon: (a) A provider of an electronic store, gateway, marketplace or other means of purchasing or downloading software or applications to review or enforce compliance with this section by those applications or software; or (b) A provider of an interactive computer service to review or enforce compliance with this section by third-party content providers. As used in this paragraph, “interactive computer service” means any information service, system or access software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides access to the Internet and such services or systems operated or offered by libraries or educational institutions. (9) This section does not apply to general audience Internet websites, general audience online services, general audience online applications or general audience mobile applications, even if login credentials created for an operator’s site, service or application may be used to access those general audience sites, services or applications.

When I am not accessing knowledge, I would still prefer to remain private. For example, what videos I access for entertainment should private. It’s not knowledge I access, just something to pass time. That those activities should b protected as well. Privacy-protected-society is probably a broader term than knowledge society.

Reply ↓ Huey Long May 19, 2017 at 12:00 pm This piece is absolutely fantastic! Not to nit pick, but I do disagree with the author about the following passage: Even if you think our intelligence agencies are evil, they’re a lawful evil. They have to follow laws and procedures, and the people in those agencies take them seriously. But there are no such protections for non-Americans outside the United States. The NSA would have to go to court to spy on me; they can spy on you anytime they feel like it. We know from the Church and Pike committees that this is patently false, and I highly doubt that this has changed much since then, especially in light of Iran-Contra and the made-up intel used to justify the Iraq invasion. I know I probably sound like a broken record as I often cite the Church and Pike reports in my NC comments, but they’re just so little known and so important that I feel compelled to do so. I encourage the entire commenteriat to at least skim some of these documents to get a better understanding of the kinds of sickening things perpetrated by the intel community in the past and then ask yourself if the veil of secrecy that surrounds them is to keep secrets from the enemy or to keep the American public from vomiting.

Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 19, 2017 at 12:32 pm I never make mistakes either. I thought I had once, but I was wrong. Reply ↓ JustAnObserver May 19, 2017 at 12:44 pm I had the same reaction to that passage, at least initially. However what I think the author might mean by this is that to have the means to combat this evil 2 things are necessary: o Laws and/or procedures that place limitations on the actions of these agencies – NSA, CIA, DHS etc. o and, much much more important, the means to ensure those laws/procedures are *enforced* as to both statute and intent. USians have at least the first part even if the second, enforcement, has rotted to the extent of being no more than a cruel joke. non-USian have neither. Note that the lack of enforcement thing extends far beyond the IC agencies into anti-trust, environmental regulation, Sarbanes-Oxley, etc. etc.. Even the ludicrous botch called Dodd-Frank could work marginally better if there was some attempt to actually enforce it. Reply ↓ Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 1:03 pm “Dodd-Frank could work marginally better if there was some attempt to actually enforce it.” Unenforceable and unenforced laws are a feature, not a bug, and demonstrate the corruption of the system.

That bit about tech workers defying management to protest Trump’s travel ban seems demonstrably untrue, as the companies want that human capital pipeline kept open, and they can simultaneously wrap themselves in muliti-cultural virtue as they defend their employment practices. Also, and I know people here will disagree or think it irrelevant, but the “They’re not bad people,” thing is wrong; I think people such as Thiel, Kalanick, Zuckerberg, Ellison, add-your-own-candidates, seem like pretty awful people doing a lot of awful things, whatever their brilliance, business acumen, and relentlessness. Finally, while as a union guy I was pleased to see the importance he gave it, the idea of tech workers unionizing in this country seems like social science fiction, whatever their European counterparts might hopefully do. Reply ↓ TheCatSaid May 19, 2017 at 3:18 pm I, too, stumbled / choked when I read those paragraphs. They are provably false in so many dimensions I hardly know where to begin. It made it hard to read past. I will try again because so many commenters are so positive. But the author’s credibility sinks when a piece starts with such blindness or misinformation or pandering. Reply ↓ PhilM May 19, 2017 at 3:41 pm On the one hand, it’s probably some pandering, because he knows he is being watched. We all throw that same bone once in a while. From Vergil, it is called “a sop to Cerberus.” On the other hand, he is correct, too: it is a “lawful evil” because it functions using tax money, which is money extorted by force with the sanction of law, rather than “chaotic evil,” which is money extorted by force or fraud without that sanction. So in that positive-law-philosophy way of thinking, he has a point, even if it’s a pandering point. Reply ↓ knowbuddhau May 19, 2017 at 12:16 pm >>>”They have to follow laws and procedures, and the people in those agencies take them seriously.” This caught my eye earlier. Had to come back to it. Especially after reading Mike Whitney’s latest http://www.counterpunch.org/2017/05/19/seth-rich-craig-murray-and-the-sinister-stewards-of-the-national-security-state/ . In it, he details how seriously Clapper, Brennan et al. take those “laws and procedures.” Taking a recent and relevant example, remember the ICA, the “Intelligence Community Assessment”? Whitney quotes a Fox news article detailing the many ways in which it’s production varied sharply from normal procedures. And of course there was all that “stove-piping” of “intel” that helped make the bogus case for the 2003 war of aggression against Iraq. I appreciate the author’s point: it would be harder to surveil a particular American than a European. I’m sure rank & file people by & large respect law and procedure. But don’t worry, if there’s a political will to get you, there’s a way. Ask Chelsea Manning. Whitney concludes by quoting an especially apt question posed by Michael Glennon in the May issue of Harper’s: “Who would trust the authors of past episodes of repression as a reliable safeguard against future repression?” People who think they’re immune to said repression, for one. Or who don’t know or believe it happened/is happening at all. IOW political elites and most Americans, that’s who. I think there’s a good chance the soft coup will work, and most Americans would even accept a President-General. So while I see the author’s point, I see it this way. They take laws and procedures seriously like I take traffic laws seriously. Only their solution is to corrupt law enforcement, not follow the law. “Stop throwing the Constitution in my face, it’s just a goddamned piece of paper!” — President George W. Bush Silicon Valley elites apparently think the same. Reply ↓ TheCatSaid May 19, 2017 at 3:25 pm Mike Whitney’s article you linked to was interesting. George Webb’s ongoing YouTube series is going further still, as he is uncovering numerous anomalies with Seth Rich’s death and the circumstances and “investigation”. It turns out that nothing in this story is what it seems (the “school play” scenario). Disturbingly, there are similarities and patterns that connect up with numerous other patterns discussed earlier in this 208-day (so far) odyssey, which started with looking at irregularities around oil pipelines and drugs shipments, and ended up including numerous additional criminal enterprises, all with direct links to high-up government staff and political staff from both major parties, with links among key participants going back over decades in some cases. To return to your observation–knowing what I know now–personal as well as second-hand, I don’t think it’s harder to surveil an american than a european. The compromises of law enforcement, justice and intelligence and rogue contractors have no international boundaries. The way the compromises are done vary depending on local methods, and the degree of public awareness may vary, but the actuality and ease–no different overall.

The PC brought freedom from the IT department, until networking enslaved us again. The freedom was temporary, we were originally supposed to be serfs of a timeshare system connected to a mainframe. France was ahead of the US in that, they had MiniTel. But like everything French … is was efficient but static. In Europe, like in the US, the PC initially liberated, and then with networking, enslaved. Arpanet was the predecessor of the Internet … it was a Cold War system of survivable networking, for some people. The invention of HTTP and the browser at CERN democratized the Arpanet. But it also greatly enabled State-sponsored snooping. We are now moving to cloud storage and Chrome-books which will restore the original vision of a timeshare system connected to a mainframe, but at a higher technical standard. What was envisioned in 1968 will be achieved, but later than planned, and in a round about way. We are not the polity we used to be. In 1968 this would have been viewed by the public with suspicion. But after 50 years later … the public will view this as progress. Reply ↓ Huey Long May 19, 2017 at 1:22 pm In 1968 this would have been viewed by the public with suspicion.

Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 7:59 pm Several years ago John Robb at Global Guerillas wrote a speculative piece about how Ham Radio Operators could work with computer people to figure out how to send dots and dashes over Ham Radio in such a way as to be understandable as “0s” and “1s” and used to code for simple things . . . perhaps even Ham Radio broadcastable text. Perhaps that article still exists somewhere in the Global Guerillas archives. A Ham RadioNet, if one wills. Also, re-standalone-ing millions of personal PC machines and figuring out how to record stuff onto discs, thumb drives or other memory storage devices. And then moving such devices around by human courier or land mail or carrier pigeon or other methods. And of course people could go back to writing and sending landletters by landmail. The amount of information sendable by landletter would be so small by comparison to digital methods that people would learn to send only the most important information. Reply ↓ MoiAussie May 20, 2017 at 3:42 am Ham Radio Operators could work with computer people to figure out how to send dots and dashes over Ham Radio in such a way as to be understandable as “0s” and “1s” John Robb seems an ignorant patronising idiot. Ham radio types have been doing digital communication since the 70s – it’s called packet radio. And building networks on top of that. Reply ↓ different clue May 20, 2017 at 4:38 pm I am but an analog refugee in this digital world. So I may not understand you correctly. I am understanding your comment to be saying that the Ham Radio community knew all about this theoretical capability waiting to be exploited years before John Robb wrote about it. If so, then we do indeed have a way to end-run around the coming Feudal Internet Lockdown. Material can be broadcast all over the Ham RadioNet and various Ham Radio operators could then load these packet radio broadcasts onto various portable storage devices which could then be hand-couriered to radio-ignorant computer users for reading and replicating to further waves of radio-ignorant computer users. So perhaps John Robb was “post-maturely right” ( a play on pre-maturely anti-fascist). Perhaps John Robb is post-maturely right about some other things and I can only find out about them from John Robb because I have zero knowledge of or about the people who already know all about these things from before John Robb. Reply ↓ Thuto May 19, 2017 at 1:33 pm Excellent post, except for the bit, as some other readers have commented, about American intelligence agencies being law abiding. Europe, and much of the world, crumbled without resistance in the face of the tech juggernauts because of the PR fetishization of anything that came out of silicon valley. The laxity of lawmakers and regulators was partly because of their unwillingness to be seen as standing in the way of “progress”. A public drunk on the need to be in with the new, “disruptive” kids on the block who were “changing the world” would have teamed up with the disruptors to run rough shod over any oversight mechanisms proposed by regulators. Hence the silicon valley PR machine always prioritises the general public as the first targets of intellectual capture, because an intellectually captured public loath to give up the benefits and convenience of “progress and disruption” is a powerful weapon in the arsenal of tech giants in their global war against regulation. And the insidious nature of the damage of overreach by these tech giants isn’t just limited to online interactions anymore, but the real world is also now experiencing disruption in the true sense of the word with gig economy companies reshaping the dynamics of entire markets and squeezing the most vulnerable members of society to the periphery of said markets, if not pushing them out entirely. In my own city of cape town south africa, a housing crisis is brewing as locals are being squeezed out of the housing market because landlords profit more from airbnb listings than making their properties available for long term rentals. Asset prices are being pushed up as “investors” compete to snap up available inventory to list on airbnb. And city officials seem more interested in celebrating cape town’s status as “one of the top airbnb destinations” than actually protecting the interests of their own citizens. Intellectual capture, and the need to be “in with the cool disruptive kids” is infecting even public sector organizations with severe consequences for the public at large, but the public is blind to this as they’ve binged on the “disruption, changing the world” cool-aid… Reply ↓ Bill Smith May 19, 2017 at 4:15 pm “PR fetishization of anything that came out of silicon valley” It had nothing to do with individuals thinking this stuff had value?

It’s imperative to understand the that the system we find ourselves in is a belief system – an ideology – and the choices to be made in regards to challenging it. https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/11/accelerationism-how-a-fringe-philosophy-predicted-the-future-we-live-in/ An excerpt: “Accelerationists argue that technology, particularly computer technology, and capitalism, particularly the most aggressive, global variety, should be massively sped up and intensified – either because this is the best way forward for humanity, or because there is no alternative. Accelerationists favour automation. They favour the further merging of the digital and the human. They often favour the deregulation of business, and drastically scaled-back government. They believe that people should stop deluding themselves that economic and technological progress can be controlled. They often believe that social and political upheaval has a value in itself. Accelerationism, therefore, goes against conservatism, traditional socialism, social democracy, environmentalism, protectionism, populism, nationalism, localism and all the other ideologies that have sought to moderate or reverse the already hugely disruptive, seemingly runaway pace of change in the modern world…” Be sure to catch such quotes as this: “We all live in an operating system set up by the accelerating triad of war, capitalism and emergent AI,” says Steve Goodman, a British accelerationist… That should remind one of this: “Musk is persuaded that we’re living in a simulation, and he or a fellow true believer has hired programmers to try to hack it….” Reply ↓ Oregoncharles May 19, 2017 at 1:58 pm “Boycotts won’t work, since opting out of a site like Google means opting out of much of modern life.” I wish he wouldn’t keep dropping into openly delusional statements like that.

Sure, they like their neoliberal IdPol as it appeals to their meritocracy worship (hence the protests against the travel ban), but not with any intersectionality, especially with regards to women (the red pill/MRA mind virus infects a lot of brains in SV). Socio-economics, though, it’s heavy on the libertarianism, albeit with some support for utopian government concepts like UBI, plus a futurist outlook out of that Rationality cult; Yudkowsky and his LessWrong nonsense have influence over a lot of players, big and small, in the bay area.

Reply ↓ TheCatSaid May 19, 2017 at 3:38 pm The points you raise are accurate. And even long before those things existed, Silicon Valley arose as conscious, deliberate high-level government strategy (or beyond-government deep state). The sources of new technology and funding have been deliberately obscured, at least as far as the general public debate goes. It has nothing to do with “innovation” and “entrepreneurship”. It is amazing to see all countries around the world hop onto the innovation, let’s-imitate-Silicon-Valley bandwagon, with no awareness that SV was no accident of a few smart/lucky individual entrepreneurs. Reply ↓ Sue May 19, 2017 at 8:15 pm I believe its birth could be traced to a very humble and smart individual named Bill Gates out of his home garage. Since then hundreds of creative Americans have parked their cars on their driveways and have made the Nasdaq flourish through their garage operations. Reply ↓ Rosario May 20, 2017 at 4:41 pm It is strange how running en masse to the “individual” end of the social spectrum ends up dumping people at an inversion of a collectivized order. There is no greater horror then a bureaucracy run by libertarians.

Reply ↓ ginnie nyc May 19, 2017 at 5:36 pm I think some of the naivete of this talk is based on a superficial knowledge of American history. Things like his remark about the Women’s DC March – “America is not used to large demonstrations…” Oh really. The writer, though intelligent, is apparently unaware of massive demos during the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights movement, the anti-Iraq war marches, the Bonus March etc etc. Perhaps his ignorance is a function of age, and perhaps the fact he was not born here, vis a vis his name. Reply ↓ Jack Sparrow May 19, 2017 at 7:14 pm This piece is sophisticated neoliberal propaganda dressed up to look like something else. Bahrain and Poland getting in the way of protesters? Poland’s government is resisting the dictates of the EU so who in fact would be protesting that? Reply ↓ different clue May 19, 2017 at 7:27 pm I will reply to an almost tangential little something which Maciej Ceglowski wrote near the beginning of his piece. ” 65.8 million for Clinton 63.0 million for Trump This was the second time in sixteen years that the candidate with fewer votes won the American Presidency. There is a bug in the operating system of our democracy, one of the many ways that slavery still casts its shadow over American politics.” Really? A bug in the operating system of our democracy? That sounds like something a Clintonite would say. It sounds like something that many millions of Clintonites DID say, over and over and over again. Clinton got more popular votes? She got almost all of them in California. So Mr. Ceglowski thinks Clinton should be President based on that? That means Mr. Ceglowski wants the entire rest of America to be California’s colonial possession, ruled by a President that California picked. And don’t think we Midwestern Deplorables don’t understand exACTly how Ceglowski thinks and what Ceglowski thinks of us out here in Deploristan. Some Clinton supporters are smarter than that. Some were not surprised. Michael Moore was not surprised. He predicted that we Deploristani Midwesterners would make Trump President whether the digitally beautiful people liked it or not. Did Mr. Ceglowski support Clinton? Did the “tech workers in short-lived revolt” support Clinton? And did they support NAFTA back in the day? You thought you would cram Trade Treason Clinton down our throat? Well, we flung Trade Patriot Trump right back in your face.

I wish EUrope luck in restraining the America-based Digital Feudalists, and I wish digital-rebel Americans luck in setting up tiny little digital “free towns” and “free republics” here and there.

Reply ↓ edr May 19, 2017 at 10:45 pm Wisdom Seeker May 19, 2017 at 12:39 pm “capitalism creates vast wealth inequality: that’s the whole point.” Not in Adam Smith’s world, nor Henry Ford’s. True capitalists prosper by creating wealth which improves the lives of everyone around them. Crony capitalists, the ones we have now, strip wealth from others. Witness today’s bubble-and-bust cycles rather than the prior widespread economic growth. …….time to restore Antitrust Law and apply it to the internet monopolists. And restore privacy rights… “ APPLY THE ANTI-TRUST LAWS That’s exactly what’s needed. These ANTI-TRUST LAWS are on the books and stopped being rigorously enforced in the 70s, coinciding with the beginning of the drop in wages. The giant Corporations pull all the profits to a few centralized locations and accumulate the POWER that goes with it, POLITICAL BUYING POWER, which they’ve drained from the cities and small business people, reducing them to clerks instead of owners. Some of those anti-trust laws forbade any business from having more that 7% of the sales in any city; Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple and of course Walmart are way over those numbers. Monopolies are a huge threat to democracy. http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaug-2016/populism-with-a-brain/ Restoring Privacy Rights and control over our own data is a very important aspect of what should be accomplished. Reply ↓ edr May 19, 2017 at 10:50 pm PS. Really enjoyed reading about the Tech guys future plans. Hilarious! Thanks Reply ↓ Kalen May 20, 2017 at 10:32 am As usually very interesting and critical subject but the author however seems to be using it as a ploy to push some political agenda of one party wisdom over another or one phony economic or political remedy over the other while ignoring the fact that what’s happening is not accidental or a natural outcome of some economic conditions or technological innovations but a deliberate policies of globalists to obtain means of control of ever increasing world populations, technologies that were not needed just a century or two ago to execute the same exactness of the social control. This seeming progress and suppose it’s side effects are the core of the global effort, accumulation and centralization of wealth, power and control is not a just a sad unwanted, undesired element of glorious future but an essential objective, directed against world population at large. Here is an excerpt from: https://contrarianopinion.wordpress.com/2016/10/28/rise-of-social-machines-a-postscript-on-the-matrix-of-control-part-two/ that address the issues of digital neo-feudalism as a rise of social machines. Some people are rightly skeptical and refuse to succumb to dehumanization hence there are introduced plenty of apologists, preprogrammed social machines unleashed onto the public selling ideas of illustrious progress pushing fantastic visions, hallucinations of AI robotic future emerging just around the corner and inevitable raise of robotic machines and glorious discarding [but in reality not replacing] of human beings as biopolitical entities that used to make profit for ruling oligarchy [in newspeak “having jobs”]. However, if one listens closely to those pontificating magnificent future one would realize that they are not talking about replacing humans doing jobs with robots doing jobs, they are talking about replacing of the nature, type of tasks to be easily programmed for robots with AI label, in a feat to slowly reorient the very objective of production away from human being [needs or wants] who previously was an ultimate end of socioeconomic activity, more toward requirements of elements of machinic society that can no longer have a need to retain any human component in it.

Reply ↓ Scott May 20, 2017 at 4:27 pm One cannot expect a single writer to give one all the answers. Eclecticism is damned hard. A free people, and we can look at two documents? Declaration of Human Rights that was mostly authored by Eleanor Roosevelt, and later the 1976 International Covenant of Civil & Political Rights that essentially gave the Declaration of Civil Rights the force of International Law. What we want is an economic system that creates more free people. What happens when more people in a nation have freedom is that they create more solutions to pressing problems either with systems or machines that enable those systems. The system ascendant now has been creating more tricks and traps for more people. Wage slavery certainly is more the desired outcome of even the academic system in the US. Rome, we are in the US doing Rome all over. Realistically one can see that repetitive aspects of the US empire in it’s greatness not for its advances in personal freedoms & health & happiness, but all of it dependent on a military industrial complex. The people are tricked and trapped and yes, the only way that they can stop it is to band together. Bert Stiles the bomber pilot wrote in his book Serenade to the Big Bird that “Economics is just a Hell of a Name for the way people live together.” From 30 thousand feet up he couldn’t see the borders, but they were there and defeating Scientific Socialism, that system had to be done first before there could be any better world, with a government of governments of which the UN was just a shadow. Capitalism is great, as long as it is regulated and then further if the goal is not just the exploitation of the weaknesses of others. Michael Hudson and those of the MMT school of economics are on the right track. Those now of the US Finance Banking System are exposed in what they intend to do to Puerto Rico. We need to band together and change the goal of the Finance banking System from what is the destruction of health, wellbeing, happiness of a US Territory to one that aims for those factors. It is a fight to pick. The other is to stop the Trump administration’s goal of taking more from the commons for private use and benefit. That fight is one to take up and is met in returning to us our Washington DC, post office. These two events illustrating polices of the people in charge & the system in place they use to concentrate wealth and power are worthy actual fights to organize to fight and reverse. All that the internet provides to me personally is what I wanted from SW radio. In that way it is great, and I love Twitter for that, though I loved CR4 pretty well. After the defeat of Carter, back at the tail end of “It’s the system.” All the fun of the fight for the idealists was taken out of the fight. The Reagan era started the era of lies and hypocrisy and secrecy of real intentions of our government even when exposed left us still all impotent. We don’t have to take it but we can’t win if we don’t pick our fights for both symbolic reasons and the reality of what they actually are. I’m leaving it with that, incomplete. Thanks. Reply ↓ different clue May 20, 2017 at 4:51 pm The food you can grow is the food you don’t need to work for others’ money to have the money to buy it from others. The heat you can trap within your own smart-designed passive solar house is the heat you don’t need to work for others to make the money to buy from others. The skywater you can harvest and store from falling on your roof is the water you don’t need to earn the money to buy. The waterless-compost-toilet body waste you can collect and sterilize for garden application in your own house and yard is the water you don’t have to waste feeding the toilet you don’t have to flush. Meaning that much less water you would have to buy. The less-electrically you can live, the less money you need to work for in order to buy the electricity you still need to live. The ideal would be to zero out electricity completely from anything which could be done without electricity. Reserve electricity for the things only electricity can do. And restrain one’s use of those things to the genuinely beneficial. Reply ↓ Rosario May 20, 2017 at 4:31 pm I’ll be the gadfly and ask a burning question, why do we need these monopolies/quasi-monopolies? What do Facebook, Twitter, Google, etc. contribute at present that is not either built solely on their founding success or on the technological foundation built through government investment over the past 60 years? Case in point, the founding of Google. Developing one of the best of many search algorithms, using government money (NSF), to be used on a publicly funded technology (Internet) is innovative and possibly even a noble contribution to humanity, but cornering 90% of the global internet search market is no longer a result of that publicly funded algorithm. It is the ravenous consumption of market share through a perfect cocktail of a good idea mixed with a massive capital pool, an immense force of talented labor, timing (luck), and astute business maneuvering (I’m thinking Microsoft here as well). An analogy to another time is the Ford Motor Company, does anyone really believe Henry Ford made the best car? Was he the best at organizing the labor process? Seem a bit of a stretch, but his was a similar story to our modern tech giants. The snowball rolling down the hill that misses all the trees tends to get larger, not the other way around. The problem is, Maciej is wrestling with a more radical problem then I think he realizes. This is the cyclical nature of Capitalist progress. These monopolies are inevitable as far as history is concerned. Undermining them requires a level of democratically (or worse autocratically) directed intervention that I think would make him very uncomfortable. The first myth that needs to be dismantled is that innovation is the exclusive partner of the free enterprising individual. He touched on this with his labor discussion but I don’t think he went far enough. All the above companies are built on a massive foundation of labor. That labor keeps the machinery going. Not the billionaire founders. Much of that labor may be paid well enough (Fordism/wages for Model Ts) but they are still selling their labor to support these monopolies, and their situation is becoming more precarious by the day. The second myth, and one that I touched on above, is that these innovations occurred in a vacuum. There is not a single aspect of the tech economy that would exist without government spending. Not one. The sooner we come to terms with this fact the better. All that said, the discussion was a good start. Reply ↓ Wade Riddick May 20, 2017 at 8:56 pm The analogy to socialism is apt (“command economy”). To sum up, the ideological problems here amount to a lack of basic property rights – in particular, a lack of digital property/banking standards allowing for the holding and transfer of digital property. When the FANGS monetize personal data, they are essentially trespassing into people’s private lives/seizing the data generated by their work. At the very heart of owning property is the right to exclude others from its use. In many aspects of our digital lives, we no longer have that. Software isn’t a product anymore; it’s a service. We’re swimming in socialism and we can’t discuss it. It’s not that we lack the language; we lack the vision and the venue. The very people who ranted against communism from below are the ones now justifying it from above – and they control our media. Software as a service may have freed it from defective product suits but that escape from liability has only helped irresponsible design blossom in the industry. But they’re beginning to see the limits of the light-fingered approach for themselves. Witness the recent pivot of Microsoft towards embracing the concept of a public utility (“WannaCry Update/ Microsoft Pushes a “Geneva Convention” to Thwart Cyberattacks” in IEEE Spectrum). Why is it economists have such a hard time understanding computer programs are a form of labor? It’s not just a matter of efficiency and factors of production. Hosting someone else’s software on your home computer is like having a million contractors in your home. Would you let an unlicensed contractor into your most intimate spaces? How about a million of them? Modern economists can’t conceive of property right properly much less think about trespass, utilities or rights of way. If we can’t realize that operating systems are utilities and if we can’t remember the true purpose of government in serving us public goods and setting standards for conduct then organized crime rings will reduce us to digital feudalism. Automated cars will be autohijacked. ISPs will monetize our vacation plans by subcontracting to the local B&E gang. Eventually they’ll team up with police planting evidence for the uncivilized process we deem civil forfeiture. Call it eminent domain without the eminence. Reply ↓ Heraclitus May 20, 2017 at 9:45 pm ‘There is a bug in the operating system of our democracy, one of the many ways that slavery still casts its shadow over American politics.’ The writer confuses the 3/5ths rule with the electoral college. The electoral college is the product of a compromise necessary to make a nation out of independent states. This is why small states have two senators just like large states, i.e..a compromise was necessary to get small states to join the union. That had nothing to do with slavery per se. It was the composition of the House, as influenced by the 3/5ths rule, that brought slavery into the equation. Since the 3/5ths rule went out with slavery, slavery has nothing to do with the election of 2016. Reply ↓ Olivier May 21, 2017 at 12:37 am Among other flaws of this article, I was extremely irritated by the author’s glib characterization of the electoral college as “a bug in the operating system of our democracy”. Ironically for one who rails about tech feudalism he seems to have no understanding of how this exists to thwart another form of political feudalism: from the most populous states to the rest of the country. If this is how much understanding he has of “his” democracy after a stay of many years perhaps he ought to give up and just go back to Europe.

CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives brought Google’s audacious ambition into sharper focus Wednesday at an annual conference attended by more than 7,000 developers who design apps to work with its wide array of digital services. Among other things, Google unveiled new ways for its massive network of computers to identify images, as well as recommend, share and organize photos. It also is launching an attempt to make its voice-controlled digital assistant more proactive and visual while expanding its audience to Apple’s iPhone, where it will try to outwit an older peer, Siri. The push marks another step toward infusing nearly all of Google’s products with some semblance of artificial intelligence — the concept of writing software that enables computers to gradually learn to think more like humans. Google punctuated the theme near the end of the conference’s keynote address by projecting the phrase, “Computing that works like we do.” Pichai has made AI the foundation of his strategy since becoming Google’s CEO in late 2015, emphasizing that technology is rapidly evolving from a “mobile-first” world, where smartphones steer the services that companies are building, to an “AI-first” world, where the computers supplement the users’ brains. AI unnerves many people because it conjures images of computers eventually becoming smarter than humans and eventually running the world. That may sound like science fiction, but the threat is real enough to prompt warnings from respected technology leaders and scientists, including Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. But Pichai and Google co-founder Larry Page, now CEO of Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc, see it differently. They believe computers can take over more of the tedious, grunt work so humans have more time to think about deeper things and enjoy their lives with friends and family. Other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, also are making AI a top priority as they work on similar services to help users stay informed and manage their lives. Google believes it can lead the way in AI largely because it has built a gigantic network of data centers with billions of computers scattered around the world. This while people using its dominant Internet search engine and leading email service have been feeding the machines valuable pieces of personal information for nearly 20 years. Now, Google is drawing upon that treasure trove to teach new tricks to its digital assistant, which debuted last year on its Pixel phone and an Internet-connected speaker called Home that is trying to mount a challenge to Amazon’s Echo. Google Assistant is on more than 100 million devices after being on the market for slightly more than six months and now is trying to invade new territory with a free app released Wednesday that works on the operating system powering Apple’s iPhone. Previously, the assistant worked only on Google’s Android software. Google’s assistant will be at a disadvantage on the iPhone, though, because Siri — a concierge that Apple introduced in 2011 — is built into that device. A new service called Google Lens will give Assistant a new power. Lens uses AI to identify images viewed through a phone. For instance, point the phone at a flower and Assistant will call upon Lens to identify the type of flower. Or point the camera at the exterior of a restaurant and it will pull up reviews of the place. Pinterest has a similar tool. Also called Lens, it lets people point their cameras at real-world items and find out where to buy them, or find similar things online. Google Photos is adding a new tool that will prompt you to share photos you take of people you know. Google will also let you share whole photo libraries with others. Facebook has its own version of this feature in its Moments app. Technology <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=31&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=300&h=250&posid=55&x=js'></script> Most Read Today Weekly Monthly Airport in east China acts to control illegal flying of civilian drones China brokerage punished for chaotic management discovered after scandal AVB sees red in Shanghai derby as SIPG ends Shenhua’s unbeaten home streak An imposing but warm taste of France in China Assange claims victory after Sweden drops rape probe China succeeds in mining combustible ice in South China Sea Nasty Night in a Restaurant Leaves Sour Taste For All A Silk Road open to the world WeChat publishes report on foreign users' behavior Computers judge driving tests Woman Tricked Into Pouring Coke Into ATMs To Get Cash Truth behind Misleading Photos at Starbucks China succeeds in mining combustible ice in South China Sea Containers fall off, stranding cruise ships and passengers Girl, 2, Dies In Freak Bank Accident <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=125&h=125&posid=21&x=js'></script> <script language='javascript' src='http://www2.shanghaidaily.com/showadcode.asp?w=160&h=600&posid=20&x=js'></script> Latest News How 3D print works First Giants Parade held in Leuven, Belgium Rouhani wins Iran's presidential election with 57% ballots Pippa Middleton marries James Matthews in Englefield, Britain Mainland-Taiwan trade up 14.8% in Q1 View more » Latest Sunday News Damiani store opened Klosterman is back with 10th book Dutch painter draws on China for passion When ink was worth more than gold Shang Xia Teahouse Sandberg’s bid to move on with life View more » °C | °F Shanghai Weather Loading...

This week, Google announced plans for stand-alone VR goggles that won't need to be attached to a PC or smartphone. Eric Risberg/AP Share Share via Emailemail Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Google offered a glimpse of how it sees the future at its annual developer's conference this week. And it involves a lot of blending between the virtual and the real worlds using augmented and virtual reality. Google is calling that blend immersive computing. Clay Bavor, who heads up Google's AR and VR division, says it's all part of a future where the virtual and real worlds blur. "Virtual reality can make you really feel transported somewhere else," Bavor says. "Augmented reality can bring kind of digital information into your environment and make it really seem as if it's there in the real world." When it comes to virtual reality other companies like Facebook's Oculus Rift, Sony VR, and HTC Vive have aimed for the expensive high end. But Google has actually reached more people with its $15 Cardboard viewer that attaches to smartphones. This week it announced plans for a more advanced VR headset. Google will be the first major company to release stand-alone VR goggles. "Unlike systems that you have to connect to a PC or where you take your smartphone and insert it into a VR headset, everything you need for VR is contained right in the headset itself," Bavor says. Google is partnering with HTC and Lenovo to make the headset. Google is also beefing up its augmented reality technology. First, there's Google Lens. The technology pulls together Google's search technology and lays it over photos from the real world. You can point your camera at a flower and the search engine will identify it for you. Point the camera at a book and it will give you reviews and information about the author. Google Lens will initially be available through Google Assistant and Google Photos. Google also announced what it's calling Visual Positioning Service or VPS. Bavor says imagine going to a large store. "You go to Lowe's and you need to find this very specific bolt. You can pull up the Lowe's app — do a search for it and then your phone will walk you step by step to the exact aisle and shelf where that bolt is," he says. Bavor says this technology may also be especially useful to the blind. But, it won't initially be widely available. It will be incorporated into a new ASUS smartphone. There's a lot of competition among the big tech companies to advance these immersive technologies — Facebook, Microsoft and Sony are competitors and analysts say Apple is likely to jump into the fray. But Google has some advantages, says Greg Sterling, a contributing editor at Search Engine Land. "Because it's got hardware, it's got a massive consumer audience and brand and it's got all this data and software expertise. And really none of the other players have all those pieces," he says. Google is adding both AR and VR capabilities to its Chrome browser. You'll be able to switch between VR experiences quickly and of course use Google's database to identify items in the real world. For example, you could point your augmented reality-enabled phone at a restaurant and review would pop up on the screen from Google search. But not all of Google's efforts may be destined to succeed. Take that stand-alone VR headset. Google's new VR goggles might not appeal to either high-end VR fans or the low-end Google Cardboard fans. Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, says the high-end users will spend money for the power of an Oculus Rift and the low-end market may not want to spend much at all. Google says its headset might cost the same as an Oculus Rift, but will be cheaper because you don't have to buy a high-end computer too. That could be too much, Blau says. "Because you really have to want to be an extended VR user, if you will, if you're going to invest more than $500 into one of these systems," he says. And Google has had previous failures with augmented reality. Google Glass was a flop with consumers because the company didn't think through the privacy implications. Google's VR headset will be out the end of this year and so will new augmented reality-capable smartphones. There's still no word on price. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

If so, you should be on Google Shopping. This post will cover the basics as well as a few advanced tricks to help you master Google Shopping and Product Listing Ads (PLAs). Getting Started With Google Shopping Google Shopping isn’t just some e-commerce engine. It reportedly accounted for 43 percent of U.S. paid search clicks in Q4 2016. Think about that! Almost half of paid search clicks went to PLAs due to a variety of factors, including: The end of right rail ads in favor of PLAs in 2016. The huge screen real estate of PLAs on mobile (taking up virtually the entire screen above the fold!). The massive uptick in mobile internet use, which surpassed desktop in 2016. RIP Right Rail. Getting started is simple. Just make sure you have an AdWords account and a Google Merchant Center account. These will be your home bases. Below are four keys to success on Google Shopping. This list includes mission-critical starting points. It also has advanced tools that set great marketers apart from the merely good. 1. Feed Optimization Your Google Shopping feed is a full list of all your product SKUs (stock keeping units). Most sellers just pull their entire product database from their website then upload directly to Google Merchant Center. Don’t do this!  Simply uploading the XML or a similar web database file seems easy yet it causes incompatibility errors with Google. These errors can lead to serious issues, including: Important products not getting listed. Duplicate listings that cost you extra budget. The dreaded suspension of your Google Shopping account, which can be exceedingly costly as you wait for Google reps to help fix and re-open your storefront. Therefore, you should use a smart feed solution to remove errors from your feed. Also, it’s important to upload a clean feed the first time. Properly sort your products using a logical progression of descriptors such as: Product ID Color Size Description Intended gender (if any) Condition Availability GTIN (Global Trade Item Number) / UPC (universal product code) The best feed solutions also continue optimizing your feed over time. They complement your keyword-optimized product titles and descriptions by: Keeping your feed complete, ensuring no data is missing. Testing different creative treatments. Testing different pricing formats, including bulk pricing vs. individual item pricing. Make sure your data feed is clean. 2. Account Structure A properly structured account is crucial to running Shopping campaigns painlessly. Think of account structure as your back-end business interface. In addition, you should structure your accounts to align with your business goals. At a high level, your accounts serve you best when you have them set up to: Drive the most traffic for your “VIP SKUs” (that is, your Very Important Products — the most profitable items with the highest margins). Properly exclude or funnel less traffic to less-important SKUs. Test continuously against different price points, seasonal promotions, and brand-new products for which you have no historical data. Some recommended account structure tips: Break up your campaigns intelligently. Create categories and subcategories to control your budget. This gives you visibility into the SKUs that matter. Break out your top SKUs as granularly as possible. Break out your best high-margin sellers. This gets you more visibility for your high-margin SKUs and makes them easier to manage. Also, on your high-margin items, this means more profits for you. Plus, you can use these highly granular listings as a basis for bidding. The majority of your bidding strategy should be around your most profitable items. Break out new items into separate campaigns for testing. You may be stocking new yearly or seasonal products regularly. Which will be the next top seller? Keep your newest products separate from your known bestsellers. Then test, test, test. Once you identify potential bestsellers, you can break out those rising stars into more granular groups for fine tuning. Exclude your “Everything Else” fields in “All Products” because you don’t want low-margin SKUs costing you unnecessary clicks. Fine-tune your campaigns to make sure you push only the exact products you want to push in each campaign — another way to focus on what’s important. Get smart automation. Manually running Google Shopping campaigns for thousands or millions of SKUs just isn’t feasible. Manually trying to get peak performance from every SKU in a million-product portfolio is impossible so it’s best to find a smart automation solution. The best ones squeeze more performance out of each SKU at a granular level and also offer superior feed management and bid optimization. Let’s hope your account structure doesn’t look like this. 3. Bid for Google Shopping Feed optimization and bidding are the two most important pieces of the Google Shopping puzzle. Missing either is like trying to have a successful marriage with only one person! While bidding for PLAs on Google Shopping may seem similar to AdWords, it isn’t. Rather than bidding for position, you bid for visibility. Either you show up or you don’t. If your ads do surface in the top PLA group, that’s a good thing. But getting featured in slot #1 versus slot #3 isn’t necessarily a matter of life and death. Since you’re not bidding for position, higher bids broaden the match types for which your products will surface. Therefore, overbidding will surface your products for irrelevant queries. In some cases, those may be too general to convert. Example: Your product listings for “luxury men’s watches” may start surfacing in queries for “men’s clothing”. Winning at bidding is a two-step process. First, you need a granular strategy to get your top SKUs visibility. Second, you need to avoid overspending on low-priority products with thin margins. Here are my top tips to succeed here: Separate SKUs into different ad groups by price. Avoid blanket bids. As a result of inefficient blanket bids for all products, you miss out both ways. You potentially underbid on important SKUs. You also overbid on low-priority products. Bid as granularly as possible for your top SKUs. Since your top SKUs make the highest margins, make sure they get time in the sun. Use an appropriate bidding strategy for each one. Use negative keywords. Again, we don’t want our products to appear for irrelevant queries. Most of all, those clicks still cost us money. Map bidding to account structure. Have your bidding strategy and account structure in harmony. This lets you quickly and easily manage your products and bidding. It also helps you diagnose any problems. So break out those important SKUs in both your bidding and account structure. You’ll be glad you did. Use “Exclude SKUs” or underbid for low performers. Don’t be afraid to cull the herd. This is especially true during competitive times, like the holiday shopping season. At those times, every advertising dollar counts! After all, you don’t want to waste your spend heavily promoting items with poor margins. When poor performers suddenly bring in tons of clicks, exclude them or cut their bids. Get smart automation. Again, you need to do all three of these important tasks: manage bids granularly for all of your top SKUs, test new products for performance, exclude poor performers. These aren’t things I recommend doing manually, especially if you sell thousands, or millions, of products. The best Shopping solutions intelligently automate bidding across all your SKUs. Smart automation adjusts bids for your top sellers and poor sellers alike. If you have a last-gen bidding solution, you may feel like you’re stuck in the old days of banging a gavel. 4. Custom Labels Do Custom Tools seem limited? Probably, since you can create only five of them. Yet each can have up to 1,000 values. These powerful tools actually exist outside your account structure. This means you can use them to fine-tune your account. Also, you can do so without any risk of muddling up your overall account structure. Another powerful property: You can use them to track and test parameters that aren’t normally even handled by Google. This includes cost of goods sold (COGS). Here are some Google Shopping tips for Custom Labels: Use Custom Labels to Track Non-Google Values. You can use these powerful tools to add modifiers that don’t exist in Google. While this includes unique product materials, this also includes COGS. So to factor in COGS: Compile reports over time across different time periods (weekly and monthly). Identify approximate margin levels for different SKUs/product lines. Run a regression analysis that also incorporates revenue and ad spend (which Google does, in fact, give you). Consequently, you make calculations that factor in margin, revenue, and ad spend. Therefore, you can approximate a COGS calculation for your products (which Google does not give you!). Use Custom Labels to test large-scale modifiers. Another common use of Custom Labels is for seasonal modifiers. This is relevant for retailers that benefit from identifying customer behavior across different seasons. In other words, for all retailers(!). You can set “Spring,” “Summer,” “Fall,” and “Winter” Custom Labels for your products. As a result, you can compare the performance of different products across seasons. Use Custom Labels to mitigate data scarcity. You can ramp up testing of new SKUs with Custom Labels. Break them out granularly and test them aggressively against specific CPA and revenue targets. You can then quickly identify which new products sell better than others. Use Custom Labels to inform bidding. You can use Custom Labels to get more granular with your bidding. You can prioritize emerging new superstar products and de-prioritize or exclude new products that don’t seem up to snuff. Use smart automation to add and verify your Custom Labels. Smart automation ensures your products don’t get improperly tagged. (For instance, a misplaced Custom Label may accidentally send a high-margin SKU to your “Everything Else” group.) Use the power of Custom Labels to perform sophisticated tests and hack in new metrics. Google Shopping Takeaways These are my top suggestions for Google Shopping. It seems like a tough and complex job, but this complicated business is much easier and more rewarding with smart best practices and smart automation. Good luck and happy shopping!

Is Facebook replacing LinkedIn as the world's professional social network? HubSpot's 2017 State of Inbound unveils a dramatic shift in B2B social media marketing, and all brands need to take notice: Nearly as many professionals are opting for Facebook as LinkedIn. Fully 74% of respondents reported using Facebook for professional reasons, versus 78% for LinkedIn. The survey also finds that in certain regions, such as Latin America, people are using Facebook for professional reasons more often than they're using LinkedIn! What does all this mean? B2B marketers who haven't already begun incorporating Facebook ads and a well thought-out strategic plan and budget for the platform might need to start doing so. The following chart illustrates the radical shift in use of the two social giants, but be sure to check out Josic's write-up for more in-depth analysis of what the change means for marketers. 2. Google brings augmented reality to search with Lens The tech giant on Wednesday announced a major push into augmented reality (AR) with the introduction of Google Lens—a tool that not only allows users to query its search engine by snapping a photo of something in the real world but also overlays digital images on what users would normally see through their phones' camera lenses. Whereas Facebook and Snapchat have used AR to make people laugh, Google Lens—available later this year—aims for utility. Users will be able to point their camera at a dog so Google can tell them what breed it is, or users can check out the reviews of a restaurant by aiming a camera at the outside of the restaurant and waiting for a digital scorecard to appear above the restaurant image. With Google Lens, your smartphone camera won't just see what you see, but will also understand what you see to help you take action. #io17 pic.twitter.com/viOmWFjqk1 — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 3. Instagram becomes even more Snapchat-y, adds face filters and eraser tool Instagram certainly doesn't waste any time developing the features that made Snapchat such a smash success in its early days. The Facebook-owned social network is introducing the ability for users to transform their selfies with animated face filters, as well as a new Rewind mode to put videos into reverse. Instagram also created the ability for users to include hashtags in their Stories, and a new eraser brush that emulates exactly what Snapchat introduced last week. 4. Twitter announces new NFL livestreaming deal for 2017... But it won't include any games. Twitter lost that bet out to Amazon, which nabbed the rights to stream Thursday Night Football games this year. But Twitter's new deal will include live content and a brand new half-hour digital series that will be hosted by NFL talent and will air five nights per week during football season. Live pregame coverage will include Periscope broadcasts, such as play warm-ups and sideline interviews, with the social networking attempting to provide fans with a behind-the-scenes experiences prior to games. Still, whereas Twitter garnered 2 million viewers for its debut game last year, over 48 million watched on TV, so Twitter still faces a (steep) uphill battle. 5. Facebook News Feed change renews war on clickbait The days of shocking headlines that you just can't scroll past without clicking might be coming to an end. Facebook is taking a new approach to tackle clickbait by taking it into account at the post level, as well as the domain and page levels. The social network will also now scan posts that have headlines that withhold information or exaggerate information, so publishers will have to get a little more creative to draw attention to their posts. Facebook engineers say Pages that don't rely on clickbait for readership should see minimal impact in terms of distribution on News Feeds. Although Facebook's power over publishers can sometimes be a scary thought, we think the social network is on the right side of history for this one. 6. Twitter adds new personalization, data-usage capabilities for users Want to control how the social network can use your demographic, interest, and other information? Alongside a new Privacy Policy, Twitter is rolling out updates that allow users to control how their information is used on the social network, all within the Your Twitter Data section at www.Twitter.com. Users will now be able to see which advertisers have included them in their tailored audiences, and use the Twitter Personalization and data section to decide how their information might be shared in conjunction with certain Twitter partnerships, as well as opt out of various data-usage and sharing options. 7. Facebook adds way for Groups to screen members The social network introduced a way for administrators to screen potential Group members via a questionnaire before they are added to the Group. Admins can now add up to three questions that users must respond to prior to being approved for new membership, a move that Mark Zuckerberg thinks will help Facebook Groups serve as true communities and let users more quickly connect with those who share common interests. Questions—the answers to which are visible only to admins and moderators—are open-ended, and users can respond to them with up to 250 characters each. Applicants can review and edit their answers until their responses are reviewed by moderators. The new feature could mean helping your brand create more qualified leads via Facebook Groups by more easily screening out potential duds. Will you use Facebook Group's new questionnaire feature? 8. Snapchat unleashes new augmented reality ads for brands Snapchat came off a very rough week after its first earnings report with a new ad unit for marketers that gives them the ability to overlay images or words on the world surrounding users' Snaps. Unlike other ad units, the new unit, dubbed Sponsored World Lenses, doesn't require users to use the front-facing camera and take a selfie; they can simply scan the world around them and watch magical graphics augment their perspective. Warner Bros. was the first to use the new ad format to promote an upcoming movie. Snapchat also launched the ability for marketers to target their face-distorting "Lenses" to users based on age, gender, or the content they view in Snapchat's Discover section. 9. Bing search results now include chatbots Microsoft's search engine, Bing, has decided to include chatbots from Facebook, Slack, Kik, and other chat platforms in its search results. The change comes as bot developers continue to press the likes of Facebook to improve the discoverability of bots—the issue many view as the key factor hindering growth for the once highly anticipated bot revolution. The Microsoft Bot Framework now includes over 130,000 developers, and the company has integrated the ability for consumers to make payments and publish bots to Skype for Business, Bing, and Cortana. 10. Facebook cracks down on fake live videos Some brands and publishers have been taking advantage of Facebook's prioritization of Facebook Live videos within its algorithm; they've been producing live streams that serve no other purpose than counting down the days to the end of the year, for example, and Facebook is ready to change that. Facebook added a section to its Live API Facebook Platform Policy that states developers shouldn't static, looping, or animated graphics and images, or live-stream polls with unmoving broadcasts. The explicit policy change comes after it was revealed that half of the top 10 Live videos of 2016 weren't actually live. We're less than 5 days away! Posted by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, December 27, 2016 11. What social networks influencers care about most Looking to incorporate influencer marketing into your social media marketing strategy? Look to Instagram. According to a recent study, the Facebook-owned picture- and video-sharing network is not only the social network used most by influencers, but also the one they focus on most. Fully 99% of survey respondents—a group of over 300 influencers—post content on Instagram, with Facebook and Snapchat rounding off the top three platforms with 67% and 51%, respectively. But where do influencers think they'll focus their energy on in 2018? Check out the full post on MarketingProfs for essential details! 12. We'll wrap with a warning for brands that want to talk like the kids Getting #Lit, claiming #SquadGoals, or saying your product or service is on #fleek might not be the best way for your brand to reach its younger consumers. That's according to a report from Sprout Social, which highlights the top behaviors demanded by consumers of brands, and places snark and slang way down on the list of desired messaging. Though users initially got a kick out of brands that were early adopters of humor, sass, and incorporating cultural trends on social, their feelings have reportedly cooled, and fans now expect messaging in line with a brand's identity. Now, nearly seven out of ten respondents report brands' using slang as irritating, even if marketers are simply trying to humanize their brand. The takeaway? It's time to re-evaluate your brand's approach on social media, ensuring that your identity matches that of your goals as well as your consumers' sensibilities.

Alarm.com releases its actions for Google Assistant, including locking doors and disarming security systems Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/20 5:01am PDTMay 20, 2017 12 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares89 Google News Actions on Google, the platform that makes it possible for third-party developers and services to integrate with Google Assistant, has been seeing a lot of success lately with important companies jumping on board like LG, GE, Logitech, and more. The newest addition though might be one of the most interesting — at least if your name is Artem Russakovskii (all hail our geeky leader!) and you have dozens of lights, locks, sensors, and cameras all working within the Alarm.com system. Alarm.com users will be able to add their system under Google Assistant's Assistant apps section or by saying, "OK Google, talk to Alarm.com." Once authenticated with their credentials, they have a lot of options at their disposal. They can change the thermostat temperature, control individual or grouped lights, lock and unlock doors and garage doors, arm and disarm their security system, and inquire about the state of any lock, light, or thermostat. Given the security concerns over disarming your system or unlocking your doors, Alarm.com provides an optional (which I think should be mandatory) setting for a 4-digit PIN code that you'll have to say to perform these potentially compromising actions. As you can imagine, Artem is ecstatic about the feature — though he would have preferred a direct smart home partner integration with Assistant instead of this third-party solution — especially because the Alexa integration for Alarm.com doesn't offer any unlock or disarm functionality. However, Alarm.com tells us that this will soon be remedied and the options will come to Alexa as well.

I want the Google Assistant to carry out tasks without having me talk to another half-baked 3rd party assistant. This is just as worse as Alexa's "10,000 skills" on the Echo that you have to memorize to use. If I have to talk to another service, I won't use it. Which is why I have never used any of the "talk to blah" third party services on Google Home since launch. Jared Eberle While I completely agree, Google has made this quite usable with shortcuts. I use Autovoice all the time now that there is shortcuts. Taco Monster Yeah, the shortcuts make it work very well. Artem Russakovskii That's true, but it's still better than no integration, and as an alarm.com user, I've been waiting for Assistant to be able to control it for months. jaycemiskel I have an Alexa and alarm.com. You're right that you can't disarm or unlock, but it does have functionality to lock your doors and arm your system. I do it all of the time. The article is somewhat incorrect. I want direct integration though. That ask alarm.com crap is annoying Taco Monster As mentioned above, you can set up shortcuts to make it a bit more palatable. Works well with my August lock. jaycemiskel Thanks. That definitely is helpful. Sucks setting it all up, but it's going to save me a lot of time in the future. Artem Russakovskii Problem is there are no variables supported by shortcuts, so you'd have to program every single device you have and every variant of the command (lock, unlock, turn on, turn off, etc). May be OK for someone with 1-2 devices, but I have dozens, so it wouldn't scale for me. Maybe I'd set it up only for the most commonly used commands, but I'm hoping Google can make shortcuts and NLP in general a lot more powerful. Right now, it's more frustrating than useful. Taco Monster I think you'll forever be an outlier on these things 😉. But yes, if catering to people like you makes the experience better for everyone, then that's obviously a great thing to get behind. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, that part is wrong, I'll get it fixed up. Btw in my tests, surprisingly, Alexa works really well, and Assistant works like absolute crap. jaycemiskel Yeah Alexa works well. I agree, just started using it with assistant today and it seems like it's more finicky than with Alexa. usnmustanger Yeah, I tested this alarm.com assistant for 10 minutes, and 90% of the time the alarm.com assistant couldn't understand what I was saying, asking me to repeat myself. I was able to successfully arm my alarm system exactly once, and was never able to disarm it by voice. Talk about half-baked... Artem Russakovskii I'm talking to Alarm.com PR now, so I'll let them know we're not quite as happy with Assistant integration compared to Alexa. Matt Colontrelle Been holding out on Google home but just installed am alarm.com system might just get one now trying the whole automated route in the house MarcVH So you can do "arm stay" with this but not "arm away". I'm guessing this is a deliberate limitation but I'm not sure I understand why. C Lo My only concern with using a system such as Google Home is the ability of these systems to mistaken someone else's voice for mine. Im glad to see the mistaken voice reducing down to 4.9% however, I'd like to see it as close to zero as possible. Once it gets in the 1% range, I will try it. Artem Russakovskii Why though? Disarming/unlocking is protected by a PIN. As for the 4.9% figure, I am not sure it has anything to do with recognizing an individual voice but rather recognizing what was said correctly. I don't think if you trained your voice for personalized results that it would recognize someone else as you 4.9% of the time...

Xerox, dumpster, Kleenex, thermos.  All are infamous examples of company’s trademarks nearly becoming a victim of their own widespread success.  When a trademark becomes so ubiquitous and so widely used by the general public as a noun or verb instead of as a brand (adjective) of goods or services, it becomes a generic term.  When that happens, the term ceases to be a source identifier and is just another word in the English lexicon. Many experts believed that Google may be the next famous term to lose its trademark protection, simply by becoming too popular a term.  All too often, consumers use the mark generically, for example by saying they “Google something” or “check Google.”  Such references are against the intentions of a brand owner and can have a devastating effect on a brand. This becomes a problem for companies trying to protect their trademark rights because marks which are merely generic are not subject to trademark protection. Generic terms are those which include “[w]ords which embrace an entire class of products or services, not all of which necessarily emanate from the same source ….” Team Cent. Inc. v. Xerox Corp., 606 F. Supp. 1408, 1413 (D. Minn. 1985) (internal citations omitted). This follows from the “spectrum” of the strength of one’s trademark, which is divided into five levels of decreasing strength: Arbitrary marks, which have no meaning as to the nature of the product “Fanciful” or “coined” marks, which are original and have little if any reference to the nature of the product or service “Suggestive” marks, which have a primary trademark significance but with suggestion as to nature of product “Descriptive” marks, which are not just suggesting, but actually describing the product or service yet still understood as indicating source And “Merely descriptive” marks, which have almost entirely reference to the product or service but capable of becoming “distinctive”. See Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976); see also Alchemy II, Inc. v. Yes! Entm’t Corp., 844 F. Supp. 560, 569 (C.D. Cal. 1994). Companies, essentially, do not want their marks to ever become “merely descriptive.” A common source of evidence on genericness is the dictionary. Gimix, Inc. v. JS & A Group, Inc., 699 F.2d 901 (7th Cir.1983). For instance, the court in Miller Brewing Co. v. G. Heileman Brewing Co., 561 F.2d 75 (7th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1025, 98 S.Ct. 751, 54 L.Ed.2d 772 (1978), relied heavily upon the dictionary to find that “light” or “lite”, was a generic term in relation to low-calorie beer. See 561 F.2d at 80–81. The Miller court also noted that the court is entitled to take judicial notice of common usage of the English language to determine whether a use is generic. Id. Where a trademark is used generically, a trademark owner may need to take aggressive measures to retain exclusive rights to the trademark. Xerox corporation attempted to prevent the genericization of its core trademark through an extensive public relations campaign advising consumers to “photocopy” instead of “xerox” documents. Google seemed to recognize this dilemma instinctively, and attempted, long ago, to take preliminary steps to ensure its success would not be its undoing.  Google has gone to lengths to prevent this process, discouraging publications from using the term ‘googling’ in reference to Web searches, and going so far as to send cease and desist letters on the same as far back as 2003.  See Google calls in the ‘language police’ on BBC News. These early actions have paid dividends.  In 2006, both the Oxford English Dictionary and the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary made efforts to strike out the difference between the noun “google” and the verb “to google” by defining google (all lower case, with -le ending) as a verb meaning “use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet”.  The company, however, continued to have the proper noun treatment of capital “G” for “Google.” This has proven helpful, as one district court in Elliot v. Google Inc., (“Elliot”) 45 F. Supp. 3d 1156 (D. Ariz. 2014), closely examined the dictionary usage of the various terms for “google”: As to dictionary usage, Plaintiffs are unable to cite to a single dictionary whose definition of the word “google” neglects to mention the trademark significance of the term. Plaintiffs accuse Defendant of “intimidat[ing] [dictionaries] into submission”, because Defendant enforces its mark. Elliot, 45 F. Supp. 3d at 1171 (internal citations omitted).  The court further held that verb use of a trademark “is not fundamentally incapable of identifying a producer or denoting source. A mark can be used as a verb in a discriminate sense so as to refer to an activity with a particular product or service,” using Adobe Photoshop as an example, e.g., to “PHOTOSHOP” an image. Id. The lower Court’s decision was upheld last week.  Judge Tallman wrote in his decision that: [The case] has failed to present sufficient evidence to support a jury finding that the relevant public primarily understands the word ‘google’ as a generic name for internet search engines and not as a mark identifying the Google search engine in particular. Thus, Google successfully argued, for now, that it owns a trademark for the search engine itself, not the act of searching. The fact that people might offer “to FedEx a package” doesn’t mean consumers can’t understand the difference between Federal Express and UPS, Google said, and the same is true for search engines. Aside from working directly with dictionaries, another common practice among trademark owners is to follow their trademark with the generic product or service word (e.g., referring to the “Google search engine”) to help define the word as a trademark. Yet, it remains to be seen whether mere public relations programs or discussions with dictionaries can stop the evolution of the public’s use of language.  Continued efforts are needed for Google, otherwise one day, “googling” oneself may refer to any old look-up of information, rather than specifically typing one’s name into a Google search bar on a web browser.

Anon May 20, 2017 10:23 am The decision seems flawed – in comparing the use of the trademark as a generic verb, “Googling” something is far more ubiquitous than “Xeroxing” ever was. Perhaps the judgement reflects more a p00r showing of counsel than a reflection of reality. Then again, Coke remains a trademark even though the entire South of the U.S. has used that word as a generic description for several generations now…. Patent Investor May 20, 2017 11:10 am I agree anon. Seems to me that Google “heavy-handing” the dictionaries should have been easily used against Google. Why did Google feel the need? What would the dictionaries have done without such actions by Google and why? Post a Comment Respectfully add to the discussion.

This week was all about Google I/O including the announcement of Google Assistant for iOS, standalone VR headsets, and more — but when it comes to deals, the biggest highlights of the week are great discounts on laptops. You may remember when we featured the Dell XPS 15 deal back in March, which was popular among The Verge readers. For $650 off, you can now get a fantastic deal on the same laptop with 16GB of RAM instead of 32GB. Our other favorite deal, exclusive to The Verge, is an additional $50 off the already discounted Lenovo 14-inch Flex 4 Series. Laptops Exclusive: for $749, grab an extra $50 off the Lenovo 14-inch Flex 4 Series Multi-Touch 2-in-1 Notebook at B&H until May 24th. It retails for around $849 elsewhere, making this an excellent deal. Ending soon: Get $500 off the HP 15t Touch Laptop (Intel Core i7 processor, 8GB memory, 1 TB HDD storage) until May 20th. Now down to $1,649, save $650 on the Dell XPS 15 9550 Multi-Touch Notebook. Score $380 off the Lenovo Yoga 710 15-inch Laptop (Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM) using promo code MAYDEAL710 at check out. It’s unclear when the promo ends, so I recommend jumping on this if you’ve had your eye on it. Other great deals At Best Buy, you can get $30 off Apple’s newest 9.7-inch iPad. B&H has some really good prices on two Huawei smartwatches. Although they’re not the most recent model, they still run on android wear 2.0.

Weekly Roundup: WannaCry ransomware attack, Google I/O, RecordGram wins Startup Battlefield Posted yesterday by Anna Escher (@annaescher) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook takes on Twitch with new live-streaming deal for esports This week the TechCrunch team threw another successful Disrupt conference, this time in New York City. 20 companies took the stage at TechCrunch’s Startup Battlefield, where they presented their products and took questions from our expert judges. The judges narrowed the competition down to five finalists. But RecordGram, a mobile recording studio where aspiring artists can find beats, create songs and get signed, won first place in the competition. You can listen to all of the interviews from our panelists including Derek Jeter, Naval Ravikant, Steve Case and many more on iTunes. Disrupt was preceded by a 24-hour Hackathon, during which 750 engineers and designers got together to create a cool hack. reVIVE, a VR solution created by a team of high school students that can provide both a diagnostic and treatment mechanism for ADHD, won first place. You can read about all of the hacks here. In the mean time, here are some of the top tech stories from this week. 1. WannaCry(pt) global ransomware attack wreaks havoc on systems worldwide A huge global ransomware attack based on leaked NSA hacking tools spread like wildfire among unpatched Windows systems worldwide on Friday. Early reports suggested it was targeted at the UK’s National Health Service, leading to routine appointments being cancelled. Thousands of computers were apparently affected in Russia alone. Critics have suggested a lack of government funding has left the NHS wide open to malware attacks that exploit outdated software, as the attack continued to wreak havoc on systems worldwide. It was only stopped by accident after a security researcher registered a web domain that had been hard-coded into it as a kill switch. 2. Google announces Google Lens and Google.ai, and Google Home gets proactive assistance  Artificial intelligence was the name of the game at Google’s annual I/O developer conference. Google Home is getting hands-free calling and proactive alerts, Android O beta went live (but we still don’t know what the O stands for), a new AI initiative that wants to make AI advances accessible to everyone was announced and Google Lens, a new tech that wants to bring more smarts into your phone’s camera, was announced. 3. The FCC officially proposes to end net neutrality rules The FCC voted to initiate a process to repeal the strong net neutrality rules that have been in place since 2015. The Senate Democrats penned an open letter, explaining that the existing net neutrality rules protect this foundation and the connected society that we all enjoy. Don’t let the FCC take that away. 4. Instagram launches selfie filters, copying the last big Snapchat feature Instagram’s testing of Location Stories was also revealed on the Disrupt stage, but the company’s main announcement of the week was that it is launching selfie filters for Instagram Stories. When asked about whether it is copying Snapchat, Instagram VP of Product Kevin Weil stated that “This is just the way the tech industry works.” 5. SpaceX successfully launches its heaviest geostationary orbital payload yet SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying a payload from communications satellite company Inmarsat, the fourth in a constellation created to provide high-bandwidth broadband internet globally. The payload is the largest ever launched on a Falcon 9, which is why the mission parameters didn’t call for an attempt to recover the first stage of the rocket. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Founded 1934 Overview Federal Communications Commission is an independent United States agency regulating interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories.

Uber threatened to fire engineer at center of Waymo trade secret lawsuit Posted yesterday by Ryan Lawler (@ryanlawler) 0 SHARES Next Story A federal appeals court shoots down the FAA’s drone registry requirement Uber has issued a sternly worded letter to Anthony Levandowski, the engineer at the center of a lawsuit alleging theft of trade secrets from Google parent Alphabet’s self-driving technology unit Waymo. The gist? Comply with the court’s orders or risk being terminated. Levandowski is the former technology lead for Google’s autonomous vehicle unit and co-founder of self-driving truck startup Otto, which Uber acquired for $680 million last summer. He is also accused of downloading tens of thousands of confidential documents related to Google’s proprietary LiDAR design before leaving the company and founding Otto. That is at the center of Waymo’s case, which was filed in February and accuses Uber of misappropriating its trade secrets and infringing on patents related to its self-driving vehicle program. The suit is going to trial and there’s the possibility of a criminal case being opened up as well. But in the meantime, Waymo has argued that discovery in the case has been held up by Levandowski refusing to answer questions related to the alleged theft of proprietary data. Levandowski has repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment in the case, citing the potential for criminal action that could lead to self-incrimination. Last week Judge William Alsup ordered that Uber “exercise the full extent of [its] corporate, employment, contractual, and other authority” to force Levandowski to return any downloaded materials to Waymo. Following that, Uber on May 15 sent a letter  to Levandowski giving him a choice between “deny[ing] ever having taken any downloaded materials from Google” or hand over any materials he might have taken from Google. If he failed to comply, he would risk termination of his employment. [A]s you know, your employment at Uber is on an at-will basis. See A. Levandowski Employment Agreement, Aug. 17, 2016 ¶ 5(a) (“August 17, 2016 Employment Agreement”). As a condition of your employment at Uber, you must comply with all of the requirements set forth in this letter. If you do not agree to comply with all of the requirements set forth herein, or if you fail to comply in a material manner, then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment and such termination would be for Cause. If you comply with these requirements, your employment at Uber will continue on an at- will basis. For the avoidance of doubt, Uber retains the sole right to determine whether you are in compliance with the requirements set forth above. In his own filing, Levandowski’s attorneys argue that the Court’s order to Uber and Uber’s own threats would violate his constitutional right to avoid self-incrimination. “Anything short of firing Mr. Levandowski to get him to waive his Fifth Amendment rights and attorney-client privileges would put Uber at risk of contempt, since it would fail to measure up to the Court’s command that Uber exercise every lawful power it has over Mr. Levandowski,” it says.

Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore blazes onto the Play Store Matthew Sholtz View All Posts 2017/05/17 9:27am PDTMay 17, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 8 Share on Facebook 30 Share on Twitter Total Shares47 Games News Videos A little under two months ago Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore showed up on the Play Store for pre-registration. There was no release date announced, but it was obvious the game was coming soon. Well, today is the day. Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore is finally available for download. So strap in and get ready to fulfill the role of a bounty hunter searching for fame and fortune. After six months of availability on iOS, Android has finally received Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore. It would appear that Deep Silver FISHLABS was working closely with Google in order to bring the game to Android in time for Google I/O 2017. The developers have reported that Galaxy on Fire 3 – Manticore is taking advantage of the Vulkan graphics standard as well as the tools of Google’s development platform Firebase. If you are unfamiliar with the Galaxy on Fire series, it is a narrative-driven space action shooter. You will have the ability to pilot various ships and customize their loadouts. Your main goal will be to fight through plenty of intergalactic gangs. The more you defeat, the higher on the totem pole you become. The gameplay has you using touch controls to pilot your ship. The left side of the screen has a floating analog stick that controls your direction. The right side of the screen has the throttle, which controls your speed. As far as shooting is concerned, this will be controlled by the A.I. by default as it will automatically shoot as long as your cursor remains close to your target. This can be changed in the settings if you would like more manual control over your shooting. When it comes to the story, you are a new space pirate who is searching for their place in the galaxy. You can expect full voice acting throughout the entire thing, which I found pretty immersive. There are a few lines delivered in a questionable fashion, but in the grand scheme, it wasn't that bad. Something to keep in mind is that Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore is a free-to-play release. This means that you can expect advertisements in the release as well as in-app purchases that range as high as $99.99 per item. These IAPs are used to buy two separate types of currencies. In my eyes, this is not a good sign as you will usually find a paywall in titles that use multiple currencies in this manner. So what can I say? Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore is a beautiful game that will stretch your hardware to the max. There is no arguing that. It is just a shame to see the series take a turn towards high priced IAPs and endless grinding. There is so much more that Galaxy on Fire could do, but I suppose that does not pay the bills.

Bryan Pizzuti You guys realize it's compatible with basically nothing right now? I've got 4 Android devices on my Play Store, it only shows up as compatible with my Chromebook R13, which I'm pretty sure was just an oversight. Basically the entry is there for it, but it's not actually available to anyone yet. Matt S. Works on the S8, I have seen reports of it working for the Pixel, LGv20, Shield K1, and OP3T. It seems the game is super demanding, so few devices are compatible. Bryan Pizzuti I have an Axon 7, a G Pad X, and a SHIELD TV, none of them show as compatible. The Axon 7 should at least be showing if the Pixel is. Even more interesting that it shows as compatible with a Chromebook R13. If the game is that intensive there's no WAY that chip can handle it. Matt S. Sure, that is obviously a mistake. I am not saying no more devices will be added, it just looks like they are being conservative right now for the most part. I've seen this happen on plenty of game releases, I am sure it will work itself out in time. Bryan Pizzuti Ok, that might be it. I'm just a little surprised that they missed the Axon but included the OP3T. Did they include the regular OP3? Matt S. Sorry, no idea about the OP3. I am just going off of what I have seen on reddit and similar places. 3223 It seems compatible with my htc 10 and the s7. May have something to do with vulkan or some other... Installing now lordmerovingian OMG, for a moment I thought, not another Galaxy phone caught fire...😂😂😂. I need some lunch.. Crafted Crows The game looks amazing but is just another dumb game like the bajillions out there. As it is pointed in the article they could have done so many things with the game but it feels like went for the easy and mindless route. kaibosh Why even post that the game is released if it is incompatible with pretty much all hardware?

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s new punishment for poorly-made apps in the Play Store Newsby Brian Reigh17 hours ago 39 1184 50 While Google has tried for the longest time to encourage developers to create high quality apps, its effort hasn’t always been successful. Well, the search giant has a new plan: for those apps that perform poorly in terms of stability and power efficiency, Google may reduce their visibility in the Play Store. See also: Everything new in Android O: features and changes 3 days ago We all know that not all apps are created equal, and that’s problematic particularly for Android. While Apple keeps a tight rein on which apps can be available in the App Store, Google’s approach has always been laxer. The result is that while the Play Store attracts budding developers and perhaps facilitates more creativity, the quality of some of the apps available is questionable, to say the least. Some apps crash constantly; some apps freeze randomly; some apps just drain your battery like there is no tomorrow. Well, at Google I/O this year, the company reaffirmed its commitment to improving the Android experience and overall device performance. That’s where Android vitals come in. Google wants to focus on speed, security, and stability with Android vitals, and not just for end-users but also for developers. Developers can now see various metrics and scores on their apps’ stability, render time, and battery usage. More specifically, Google wants to look at the following: App not responding (ANR) rates Crash rate Slow rendering Frozen frames Stuck wake locks (the app keeps the device awake for more than an hour) Excessive wake-ups (the app wakes up the device more than 10 times an hour) Using these metrics, Google wants to find out which apps rank among the bottom 25 percent. And if your app is one of them, you’re likely to hear from the search giant. Using these metrics, Google wants to find out which apps rank among the bottom 25 percent. And if your app is one of them, you’re likely to hear from the search giant. Back in February, the company announced that an app’s performance will impact its “promotability,” meaning with Google’s new initiative, apps that fail to meet certain standards regarding aforementioned metrics ­– apps that fall below the 25 percent threshold – may not be so visible in the Play Store from now on. With millions of apps available now, Google’s Play Store has faced growing criticism over fake apps, low quality apps, and malware apps in the recent years. Therefore, Google’s new program, which promises to establish more rigorous standards, is certainly a welcome change. Do you think Google’s new “punishment” will have a positive impact?

Survey predicts interesting results for Gloucestershire Some people in Gloucestershire have told one survey, run by Google, their plans for June 8  Share ByMatt Discombe 14:08, 20 MAY 2017 News UKIP support is set to fall at the General Election, according to a new survey  Share Have you decided which way you'll vote in the election yet? Well some people in Gloucestershire have told one survey, run by Google, their plans for June 8 - and it's come up with some interesting projections for how things may turn out on the day. The Conservatives swept the board in the 2015 General Election - and until parliament was dissolved they held every seat in Gloucestershire. Read More How General Election pledges are finding favour - or not - in Gloucestershire and the south west It's election time again But could that all change in a few weeks' time? Here's what the survey tells us. Many are undecided If 'Don't Know' were an actual party they'd be well ahead as 32.1 per cent of people in the survey selected that option. In fact, there were more undecided voters than for any of the parties. That suggests there are a lot of votes still to play for in Gloucestershire during the next few weeks of hard campaigning. But if what can we learn from people who have already made up their minds? Tories on top Richard Graham and his family at the General Election 2015 count at Oxstalls Sports Centre. The Conservatives have a clear lead in the poll - 27.5 per cent of people in the survey said they would vote for them. That compares with 21.3 per cent for Labour and 8.7 per cent for the Liberal Democrats. Read More Now the hard work starts to improve Gloucestershire, say county council bosses If this survey is anything to go by, the Tories would take Gloucester, Cheltenham, the Forest of Dean, the Cotswolds and Tewkesbury. But Gloucestershire may not be all-blue, as the survey suggests there is one area of the county the Conservatives may not come out on top of. Labour to take Stroud? Labour could clear winners in Stroud, according to the survey, taking 32.9 per cent compared to the Conservatives' 25.8 per cent. If this were to pass, it would mean David Drew would win his seat back from Neil Carmicheal, to whom he lost in 2010. David Drew in 2010 And although that's the only seat Labour wins in the survey, they fight the Conservatives hard in Gloucester - where there is just 0.9 per cent in it, and in the Forest of Dean, where they miss out by 2.1 per cent. In Gloucester that would mean the gap would have closed considerably from the 13 point lead Richard Graham won with in 2015. What about the other parties? Well they could be in for a night of disappointment if the survey tells us anything. The Lib Dems get just 8.7 per cent of the votes in the survey. They're campaigning hard to win back Cheltenham but in the survey they fall well short - getting 17.4 per cent to the Conservatives' 25.2 per cent. Martin Horwood pictured in 2010 Read More The Great Gloucestershire Survey - what's life REALLY like here and what needs to change? What's also interesting about Cheltenham is that in the survey Labour get 14.4 per cent of the vote - double what they got in 2015. Could a strong Labour performance in the town hurt the Lib Dems' chances? UKIP get just 4.8 per cent of the vote, while 5.6 per cent would go with another party. So what does that tell us? Well since the survey was answered by 1,441 people - around a third still undecided - maybe not much. But it does give us an insight into where Gloucestershire may be going on June 8.

Now updating the drivers on your phone isn’t really something many of us think about, unlike computers where we sometimes get prompted by manufacturers. However with Android O, it seems that Google is going to make it a bit more obvious. During Google’s Android Fireside Chat help at Google I/O 2017, it seems that one of the features that users can expect in Android O is that your phone’s GPU’s drivers can be updated from the Play Store, which makes it a one-stop shop for app downloads, updates, and now GPU driver updates as well. However whether or not OEMs or chipset manufacturers plan on taking advantage of this feature remains to seen. It is also unclear as to how exactly this will work or how it might present itself, but Android Police is suggesting that this could be part of Google’s Project Treble whose aim is to try and push out Android updates faster. In any case it sounds rather interesting, although we guess for the most part the average user might not care too much about it or even notice it. Filed in Cellphones.

It seems that Google is working on a Chromebook emulator for Android app developers As the name suggests, this is an emulator designed to mimic a Chromebook or a device with a larger display, so that when Android developers are planning to make their apps compatible with Chrome OS, they can use the emulator to ensure that their apps are optimized for devices with larger displays. According to Google, they claim that most apps will already work on a larger form factor device, but developers could use the emulator to help make it a more optimized experience if they are hoping to make full use of Chrome OS. It is interesting that Google is putting in so much effort especially when they have stated that in the past there are no plans to merge the platforms. That being said, the emulator is still in development but developers who are interested in having early access can go ahead and sign up via Google’s website. Filed in Computers.

		     Privacy Policy Thank you Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. By Mike Elgan Contributing Columnist, Computerworld | May 20, 2017 4:00 AM PT Credit: Underwriters Laboratories More like this Get to know the Premier 100 Class of 2017 Welcome to a world of sensors Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+: Great enterprise phones with potential to be better Video Smart Cities: Barcelona Google dazzled developers this week with a new feature called Google Lens. Appearing first in Google Assistant and Google Photos, Google Lens uses artificial intelligence (A.I.) to specifically identify things in the frame of a smartphone camera. In Google's demo, not only did Google Lens identify a flower, but the species of flower. The demo also showed the automatic login to a wireless router when Google Lens was pointed at the router barcodes. And finally, Google Lens was shown identifying businesses by sight, popping up Google Maps cards for each establishment. Google Lens is shiny and fun. But from the resulting media commentary, it was clear that the real implications were generally lost. The common reaction was: "Oooh, look! Another toy for our smartphones! Isn't A.I. amazing!" In reality, Google showed us a glimpse of the future of general-purpose sensing. Thanks to machine learning, it's now possible to create a million different sensors in software using only one actual sensor -- the camera. In Google's demo, it's clear that the camera functions as a "super-sensor." Instead of a flower-identification sensor, a bar-code reader and a retail-business identifier, Google Lens is just one all-purpose super-sensor with software-based, A.I.-fueled "virtual sensors" built in software either locally or in the cloud. Remember the 'trillion sensor world'? Talking about the Internet of Things (IoT) four years ago, the phrase "trillion sensor world" came into vogue in IT circles. Futurists vaguely imagined a trillion tiny devices with a trillion antennas and a trillion batteries (that had to be changed a trillion times a year). In this future, we would be covered in wearable sensors. All merchandise and machinery would be tagged with RFID chips that would alert mounted readers to their locations. Special purpose sensors would pervade our homes, offices and workplaces. We were so innocent then -- mostly about the promise and coming ubiquity of A.I. and machine learning. In the past four years, another revolution has disrupted the expected "trillion sensor world" revolution, namely the rise in cloud A.I., which changes everything. Instead of different, single-purpose sensors installed all over every vehicle, person, wall, machine and road, we'll have general-purpose super-sensors, and their data will be used for software-based virtual sensors. Why 'synthetic sensors' are better than real ones Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) last week unveiled their "super sensor" technology, which they also call a "synthetic sensor." CMU Carnegie Mellon University researchers this month unveiled their super-sensor technology, which can detect just about anything happening on a factory floor. int Despite the name, there are real sensors involved. The researchers have developed a board containing a small range of sensors commonly used in enterprise and commercial environments. The encased board functions like a single black-box sensor that plugs into a wall or USB power source and connects via Wi-Fi. In other words, one small device functions as an all-purpose super sensor, which you can plug in and deploy for any sensing application. These sensors can detect sound, vibration, light, electromagnetic activity and temperature. The boards do not include regular cameras, largely to address concerns about user or employee privacy. You could also imagine a more powerful version that does include a camera. As events occur near the sensor board, data is generated in specific, uniquely identifying patterns, which are processed by machine learning algorithms to enable the creation of a "synthetic sensor" in software. Here's a simplified version of how such a sensor might work in a warehouse setting. You plug in one or a few super sensors. Then somebody uses a forklift. The resulting vibration, sound, heat and movement detected by the super sensor generate patterns of data that are fed into the system. You can identify this as "forklift in operation." (Further tweaking might determine not only when a forklift is in use, but where it is, how fast it's moving, how much weight it's carrying and other data.) You can then program next-level applications that turns on a warning light when the forklifts are moving, calculates wear-and-tear on forklift equipment or detects unauthorized operation of forklifts. The output from these "synthetic sensors" can be used by developers to create any kind of application necessary, and applied to semantic systems for monitoring just about anything. The best part is that you could go in and create another "synthetic sensor" -- or 10 or 100 -- that detect all movement, activity, inventory, hazards and other things -- without any additional sensors. A video produced by the CMU researchers showed applications in factories, offices, homes and bathrooms. For example, in the bathroom, it kept track of how many paper towels were used, all based on the sound produced by the paper towel dispenser. It could also monitor the total amount of water used there. Again, the revolution here is not the ability to monitor everything. The revolution is to install a super sensor once, then all future sensing (and the actions based on that sensing) is a software solution that does not involve new devices, changing batteries or any of the other inflexible solutions imagined with the "trillion sensor world." Imagine being able to buy cheap hardware that plugs into a wall, then from that point on all monitoring of equipment, safety, inventory, personnel and so on is done entirely through software. Going forward, there would be no need to upgrade sensors or IoT devices. And get this: CMU's research is funded mostly by...Google! The real power of A.I. These two projects -- Google Lens and the Google-funded CMU "synthetic sensor" project -- represent the application of A.I. to enable both far fewer physical sensors and far better sensing. A.I. has always been about getting machines to replicate or simulate human mental abilities. But the fact is, A.I. is already better than human workers in some areas. Think about a traditional office building lobby. You've got a security guard at a desk reading a magazine. He hears the revolving doors turn and looks up to see a man approaching the desk. He doesn't recognize the man. So he asks the visitor to sign in, then lets him proceed to the elevator. Now let's consider the A.I. version. The sound of the revolving door signals another person entering the building (the system is keeping an exact count of how many are inside). As the man approaches, cameras scan his face and gait, identifying him positively and eliminating the need for antiquated "signing in." The microphone also processes the full range of subtle sounds he makes while walking. This, combined with thermal, chemical and other sensors, concludes that he is unarmed, eliminating the need to process him through a metal detector. By the time he reaches the door, the A.I. sends a command to unlock the door and allow him into the building. The record of his visit is not written in ink on paper, but in a searchable electronic form. The best part is, any number of new applications could be written to detect different things, all without changing the physical sensors. Those same sensors in the lobby could replace lighting controls, smoke detectors and thermostat controls. They could alert maintenance when the windows need cleaning or the trash needs emptying. It's easy to imagine applying this kind of all-purpose sensor-plus-A.I. system beyond the lobby to the boardroom, offices, factories, warehouses and shipping systems. Even as the cloud A.I. rapidly learns and increases its capabilities, companies will be able to build custom virtual sensors as the need for them arises. Cameras can be deployed where appropriate, such as in the lobby, with other, non-camera sensors deployed where not, such as in the building's bathrooms. Best of all, the super-sensor revolution will be widely distributed. The physical sensors are very inexpensive, and the A.I. is available through the cloud as a service, not just from Google but from a wide range of providers. The rise of cloud-based A.I. as a service has been obvious for a couple of years now. But this month, we've seen one of the most profound changes this revolution will usher in. With a few inexpensive cameras, microphones and other sensors, we'll be able to create just about any sensor in software on the fly at low cost. The old model of the "trillion sensor" IoT is dead, killed by A.I. and the rise of the super sensor.

Name: Subject: Message: Android Go has a redesigned Recents view for more efficiency Newsby Brian Reigh18 hours ago 7 403 11 In addition to specially optimized apps like YouTube Go, Android Go will feature a brand-new Recents UI to allow for faster and more power-efficient switching. See also: Android Go is NOT a replacement for Android One 1 day ago One of the most exciting announcements at Google I/O this year (aside from Google Home launching in Canada this summer) was the introduction of Android Go. Designed specifically for budget-friendly Android smartphones not just in developing markets but also established ones like the US, Android Go is similar to Android One but does not replace it. Any Android smartphone with 1GB of RAM or less will run on Android One, which boasts a completely modified system that promises significant power-efficiency and low data consumption. We’ve already explained how Google wants to bring optimized apps to these devices, but we haven’t heard much about the specific changes to the UI. Until now, that is. Google has made some important changes to the system UI, specifically the Recents view, in order to facilitate improved latency and to reduce memory footprint. Design-wise, with Android Go, you no longer have the stacked cards of recently used apps; instead, you get full preview cards, big enough to occupy the entire screen: Google says that 95 percent of entry-level device users don’t do a whole lot of switching, usually sticking to the four most recent apps. Google says that 95 percent of entry-level device users don’t do a whole lot of switching, usually sticking to the four most recent apps. Indeed, for power-hungry users, having almost full-screen cards in the Recents view is certainly less efficient than having stacked cards when it comes to jumping back and forth between multiple apps. However, it may not be so inconvenient for entry-level device users; in fact, it makes more sense. After all, this UI change is what enables fast and fluid switching on devices with 1GB or even 512MB of RAM. What are your thoughts on Android Go? How do you like the new Recents UI?

Bloomberg photo by Michael Short   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- Google kicked off its annual developers conference Wednesday by outlining a broad vision of how it thinks artificial intelligence will shape the way we communicate, travel, work and play. Chief executive Sundar Pichai said that improving artificial intelligence is Google's top strategy in its continuing goal to organize the world's information. Using AI, Gmail will now suggest phrases for your replies, based on its interpretation of your conversation. Google Photos will figure out which of your snapshots are best for sharing, and it will use facial recognition to figure who should get those photos. A program called Google Lens will analyze your photos and be able to remove obstacles, such as a chain-link fence, that obscure your shot. Google Assistant will also be more proactive, now nudging you to leave earlier if the traffic to your next appointment is bad, rather than waiting for you to ask about it. The differences are subtle, but significant, said Gartner research Vice President Brian Blau. "We're not going to see that many new features -- maybe some new buttons and dials. But what will improve is how well these apps relate to the individual." With those personalized improvements, however, will come an even greater demand for data from Google services. For example, one big addition to Google Photos is the ability to auto-share your photos with a person of your choosing. That means that users not only allow Google to process their pictures, but also tell the company who their closest confidantes are. "Many of these new features in Google Assistant, Photos, and Home add value but also require the sharing of a lot of personal voice, photo, video and location information," said Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insight and Strategies. "Google has the most personal information, [and] does the processing in the cloud, so I think right now they have the richest consumer AI capabilities." Consumers looking for big gadget announcements out of the conference, however, may have been disappointed. There was almost nothing said about Android Wear, Google's play for wearables. Details about the next version of Google's Pixel smartphone line -- about which Google has offered few sales details -- aren't expected to come until later this year. Google did release some brief details about its plans for stand-alone virtual reality headsets -- which will not rely on a smartphone or a computer for power. Lenovo and HTC (which already makes a rival headset, the HTC Vive) are working on these products with Google; the company did not announce an official release date. But Google, like Microsoft and even Apple, seems to be focusing developer attention more strongly on software and services rather than solely on gadgets, analysts said. While devices are undoubtedly still important, priorities seem to be on making sure that consumers using any device will be able to use Google services. One of the only products actually announced at the conference was a new version of a chip known as a tensor processing unit or TPU, which is custom-built for -- what else? -artificial intelligence processing in the cloud. "I think, in general, we'll start to see devaluation of individual devices over time," Blau said. Instead, he said, companies are likely to focus on making "whatever screen you're looking at more personal and a lot more meaningful to you as an individual."

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)   Peter Blumberg and Jef Feeley Bloomberg     No matter how often you invoke a certain internet search engine's name when doing online research, Alphabet Inc. still owns the brand. That's the upshot of a federal appeals court's decision Tuesday rejecting the argument that Google has become so popular as a verb that it should lose its status as a protected trademark. Genericide, as it's known, is the curse of companies whose brands gain such strong currency in the marketplace that they morph into product categories. Think of aspirin, escalator or yo-yo, but not coke. The fight over whether one of the world's most valuable brands should be declared generic started when a man named Chris Gillespie in 2012 acquired 763 internet domain names that included the word "google." After Google filed an objection with the board that referees domain-name disputes and accused Gillespie of "cybersquatting," he and another man asked an Arizona federal court to cancel Google's trademark on the grounds that it's a "generic term universally used to describe the act of internet searching," according to court filings. The Arizona judge didn't buy the argument, and on Tuesday, neither did the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The men didn't present sufficient evidence that the public thinks of the word 'google' primarily as a generic name for internet search engines rather than as the brand of the Google search engine in particular, the three-judge panel said. "The mere fact that the public sometimes uses a trademark as the name for a unique product does not immediately render the mark generic," U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Tallman wrote for the panel. Rebecca Ginsberg Rutkoff, a Google spokeswoman, didn't immediately respond to a phone call seeking comment on the ruling. Tallman noted that other household names, including Coca-Cola Co., have beaten back efforts to have their brands declared generic and unprotected over the years. Coca-Cola won a 1982 trademark-infringement case against a local restaurant that surreptitiously replaced customer orders for "a coke" with a non-Coca-Cola beverage. The restaurant unsuccessfully argued that "coke" covered a generic category of soft drinks. Jason Kravitz, a Boston-based trademark lawyer, said the appeals court's decision reinforces how difficult it is for challengers to have brand names declared generic. "These kinds of challenges are par for the course when a company has been successful enough to establish market dominance," he said.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple These are the best Google Assistant features that Siri can’t match Chris Mills BGR News May 19, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Earlier this week, Google finally put the Google Assistant onto iPhones. For the first time, Apple fanboys can use Google’s AI to perform a bunch of tricks, but much more importantly, it means we can finally have a Google Assistant vs Siri showdown. This isn’t a fair fight on several counts: Google’s been doing AI for much longer and has more data to mine; but Siri’s also the built-in AI, which gives her access to far more of the iPhone’s functions. But despite blatant Apple favoritism for Siri, Google Assistant can still pull a bunch of tricks that Siri can only dream of. Don't Miss: Exclusive: The world’s first look at Apple’s final iPhone 8 design in real life Written conversations The first feature you’re likely to notice is that you can type questions to Google Assistant. If, like me, you’d never be seen dead talking to your phone in public, this is a genuinely game-changing feature. It lets you use all the smarts of Google without needing to say actual words in public and have everyone around you judging your movie choice. Written queries get treated exactly the same as spoken things: you can write in natural speech, so things like “set an alarm for 7” or “what’s the weather like today” keeps working just fine. Contextual answers Another of Google’s neat features is that it remembers what you’re talking about. For example, you can ask “Who directed Batman Begins,” and then immediately follow up with “show me pictures of him,” and it’ll bring up images of Christopher Nolan. It goes a long way towards making the Google Assistant feel like a real person, not some kind of information-fetching bot or an enhanced version of Google. Google will even suggest a lot of these follow-up features to you. Once I’d asked about Christopher Nolan, it provided a bunch of prompts like “Images” and “Movies,” which you can tap to get more info. It feels a lot like the information cards that Google serves up when you do an internet search, but easier to access. Flight status You can ask Google “What’s the status of Delta flight 361 to Atlanta,” and it’ll give you info directly within the app without kicking you out to a web page. Siri’s not even close — as with many things, if you ask it for a flight status, it’ll do a web search and give you the top pages. Even when Google can’t give you precise flight status, it still gives useful info. For example, I tried asking “What’s the status of the Delta flight from Charlotte to Wilmington,” it sent me to a web page for Wilmington airport, with Airline:Delta and Origin:Charlotte already filled in. Bots Google has opened up the Assistant’s natural-language-processing to a bunch of third-party companies. One of the better ones is Genius, the music recognition and recommendation database. Ask the Assistant “I’d like to talk to Genius,” and you get a new conversation specifically with the Genius bot. From there, you can type in a couple of lyrics, and it’ll tell you what song you’re listening to and information about it. In many ways, I actually prefer it to Shazam or other services that listen to a sound clip. Quite often, I’m in a bar where a music recognition service won’t work, but I can make out snippets of lyrics. Typing that straight into the Assistant is a little easier than doing a Google search, and gives better results. Read More Shopping list This is a little unfair, because both Google Assistant and Siri do have a shopping list feature. But Google’s is much faster and slicker to use, and syncs to a dedicated Shopping List that’s tied to your Google account, and you can easily manage from multiple devices. Way more importantly, though, Google Assistant doesn’t just keep the shopping list as another list. When you browse to the list in the Home app (or just ask Google Assistant “shopping list,”) you get the option to shop your list using Google Express. You can view the list, browse item options, and then checkout all without leaving the app, or really feeling like you’re doing anything. Where Siri still wins There’s one big caveat to all this, though: Google Assistant requires you to open up an app before you can use it. Siri can be activated by your voice or by pressing the home button, which takes seconds off the process every time you use it. Sure, Google’s voice recognition is much better, and it syncs with all your Google accounts, but that doesn’t really matter if you don’t use it. While Siri remains the only option for the native voice assistant on the iPhone — and I don’t see Apple changing that any time soon  — the Assistant is still going to be second-best.

Here's what we learned at the show. It's very easy to dismiss Google I/O as just an opportunity to show off new toys and to throw a big party. Given the appearance of LCD Soundsystem at this year's closing concert, the impression is understandable. But I/O 2017 was when Google's efforts in big data, search, and device ubiquity bore fruit as it transitions toward a new focus on AI and machine learning. Everything Old Is Finally Here Google I/O 2016 is etched in my mind for two reasons. First, it was deadly hot, dampening the fun of an outdoor conference with sweat. Second, nothing announced was actually released. In retrospect, 2016 was a building year for Google. Products announced last year, including Google Assistant and Google Home, have now been in the wild—some, like Android Wear 2, for just a few months. This year, we heard about improvements and Google opened them to developers. Developers can now work on Android, Chrome, the Google Assistant, and Google Home through the Actions API. Instant Apps are also now available, taking away the primary friction point of downloading and using apps. The omnipresence of the Google Assistant also means Actions developed for it will filter into many new platforms, including the iPhone. In fact, the iPhone was mentioned with such frequency, it began to feel less like a competitor and more like another platform ripe for development. The fact that the Google Assistant will be moving into Siri territory made this abundantly clear. This is particularly notable because Android has always been the centerpiece of the Google developer experience. True, not every attendee is an app developer, but Android has always loomed large. This year, the presence of Android wasn't necessarily diminished, but it was just one of many platforms under the Google umbrella. Taking the Reins As a developer conference, I/O is an opportunity to not only encourage developers to adopt new tools and new platforms, but to offer some useful feedback as well. That's not unusual, but there was some tension in the discussions this year. At the developer keynote, Android luminaries explained how new restrictions on data, processing power, and battery power for apps are not meant to be punitive but to make Android better for everyone, including users. That's a sensible viewpoint — it might even be correct — but it felt decidedly more prescriptive than past Google sessions. That's just a few of the new ways Google is reclaiming Android. Project Treble, described in the Android security panel, divides Android into three segments. Google will maintain control of the core OS segment, hopefully allowing for bigger, broader updates with less meddling from device manufacturers and carriers. There are also new rules about user identifiers. Developers and advertisers use these to track users on and off their devices and serve up targeted ads. Restricting them is a privacy win for consumers, and probably a data win for Google, which controls most of the means of identifying users. The Turning Point in Android O Another innovation in Android O comes in the notification center. Google designers and developers have paid particular attention to notifications and icons over the last few iterations of the OS. They rightly understand this is a major area of interest for consumers, and a primary area of interaction. "Channels" is the internal term Google applies to new categories of notifications. In O, developers will group their notifications together into different types, letting users change how those notifications appear, or if they appear at all. Google's leadership says this is a feature requested by users and developers, and the benefits for both are clear. Users get more control over how their phone works — a key Android concept. Developers have more ways to communicate with users, and users will be less likely to simply uninstall apps that generate unwanted notifications. Instead, those notifications can simply be silenced. That all comes with a catch: Once developers target Android version 26 (or Android O, to its friends), they must use notification channels. If they don't, their app's notifications will be dropped and simply not appear. This, of course, will have limited impact in the Android user community, given the low adoption rates for new Android OSes. But O will be a turning point for the platform and all developers. Also during the session on notifications, the Googlers on stage took the unusual step of asking developers not to abuse the ability to change colors on notifications — a new feature in Android O. This warning was included in the developer documentation (and I noted it in my review of the pre-release of O), but it was strange to hear it on stage. It was also strange to hear Googlers say they were "giving a lot of trust" to developers, and promising to take away these privileges if they felt colorful notifications were being abused. It was odd, partly because of the paternalistic tone, but also because the vast majority of Android developers were not in the room or at I/O. VR and AR, Unleashed There are only two major tech companies with fully functional AR experiences: Microsoft through HoloLens and Google with Project Tango. Tango has been my perennial favorite at Google I/O in part because it is so radically different from other Google efforts, and also because it has felt ready for primetime since 2014 at least. Tango had a big coming out this past year with the announcement of the first commercial phone to support it, the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. This year, we got word of an entirely new device with a thinner body and brighter screen. Lowe's has also agreed to let Google map 400 of its stores to provide in-store navigation via Tango devices that can take you directly to items on your shopping list. From my conversations with the Project Tango team, the main focus right now is improving the overall experience and supporting the rollout of consumer applications for what was once a lab experiment. But we did get some hints. A session specifically on Tango showed off future efforts to identify discrete objects within the room, software that can map a room and then clear all the furniture from it, and an app to automatically generate 2D floorplans. One of the most exciting applications was an autonomous aerial drone using Tango technology to navigate obstacles at top speed. The biggest VR announcement of Google I/O was, without a doubt, standalone VR devices. Google was short on details, but it's a marked departure from previous VR efforts. Google dipped its toe into the world of VR with the Cardboard, a $20 frame for a smartphone that provided a surprisingly immersive and low-cost VR experience. The company doubled down with Daydream, which used only high-end phones and a specialized headset, but still cost dramatically less than any other VR experience. A standalone VR device effectively removes the hurdle of Google itself. It's a huge boon to Google and for the developers who want to try this new platform. With a standalone device, Google can offer VR to anyone willing to purchase such a device. You won't need a specialized Android phone; it will all be one package. Related The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 The Coolest Things From Google I/O 2017 Daydream is very impressive in its own right, and I'm excited for a standalone device that will allow iPhone users and others to enjoy Daydream apps. Hopefully it will cost far, far less than the Vive and the Oculus Rift. But I worry about moving too far from the humble Cardboard. Part of what impressed me about it was its DIY efficiency and remarkably low barrier for entry. As the price of Google's VR experience goes up, the number of people who can enjoy it will go down. Going Forward In 2016, it wasn't clear what the AI revolution actually meant for Google. While machine learning was certainly at the forefront, there wasn't any tangible evidence of how this would work for Google. It could all have easily been dismissed as a fad, or just a nice way to encapsulate a sector of Google's progress that had flown under the radar. This year, we finally saw what being "AI first" really means. It means Google in more places, it means developers being able to interact in new ways (and on new devices). And most importantly, it shows Google with far more focus than ever before. It seems very likely to me that this year specifically will mark a major turning point not just for Google, but for the entire industry.

Eric Risberg/AP hide caption toggle caption Eric Risberg/AP Dan Howley tries out the Google Daydream View virtual-reality headset and controller on Oct. 4, 2016, following a product event in San Francisco. This week, Google announced plans for stand-alone VR goggles that won't need to be attached to a PC or smartphone. Eric Risberg/AP Google offered a glimpse of how it sees the future at its annual developer's conference this week. And it involves a lot of blending between the virtual and the real worlds using augmented and virtual reality. Google is calling that blend immersive computing. Clay Bavor, who heads up Google's AR and VR division, says it's all part of a future where the virtual and real worlds blur. "Virtual reality can make you really feel transported somewhere else," Bavor says. "Augmented reality can bring kind of digital information into your environment and make it really seem as if it's there in the real world." When it comes to virtual reality other companies like Facebook's Oculus Rift, Sony VR, and HTC Vive have aimed for the expensive high end. But Google has actually reached more people with its $15 Cardboard viewer that attaches to smartphones. This week it announced plans for a more advanced VR headset. Google will be the first major company to release stand-alone VR goggles. "Unlike systems that you have to connect to a PC or where you take your smartphone and insert it into a VR headset, everything you need for VR is contained right in the headset itself," Bavor says. Google is partnering with HTC and Lenovo to make the headset. New #Daydream standalone headsets from partners like @htcvive won't require a phone or PC. #io17 pic.twitter.com/7TpYPJGEdU— Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 Google is also beefing up its augmented reality technology. First, there's Google Lens. The technology pulls together Google's search technology and lays it over photos from the real world. You can point your camera at a flower and the search engine will identify it for you. Point the camera at a book and it will give you reviews and information about the author. Google Lens will initially be available through Google Assistant and Google Photos. Google also announced what it's calling Visual Positioning Service or VPS. Bavor says imagine going to a large store. "You go to Lowe's and you need to find this very specific bolt. You can pull up the Lowe's app — do a search for it and then your phone will walk you step by step to the exact aisle and shelf where that bolt is," he says. Bavor says this technology may also be especially useful to the blind. But, it won't initially be widely available. It will be incorporated into a new ASUS smartphone. There's a lot of competition among the big tech companies to advance these immersive technologies — Facebook, Microsoft and Sony are competitors and analysts say Apple is likely to jump into the fray. But Google has some advantages, says Greg Sterling, a contributing editor at Search Engine Land. "Because it's got hardware, it's got a massive consumer audience and brand and it's got all this data and software expertise. And really none of the other players have all those pieces," he says. 13.7: Cosmos And Culture Are We Turning Into Machines? Google is adding both AR and VR capabilities to its Chrome browser. You'll be able to switch between VR experiences quickly and of course use Google's database to identify items in the real world. For example, you could point your augmented reality-enabled phone at a restaurant and review would pop up on the screen from Google search. But not all of Google's efforts may be destined to succeed. Take that stand-alone VR headset. Google's new VR goggles might not appeal to either high-end VR fans or the low-end Google Cardboard fans. Brian Blau, an analyst at Gartner, says the high-end users will spend money for the power of an Oculus Rift and the low-end market may not want to spend much at all. Google says its headset might cost the same as an Oculus Rift, but will be cheaper because you don't have to buy a high-end computer too. That could be too much, Blau says. All Tech Considered Google Glass Didn't Disappear. You Can Find It On The Factory Floor "Because you really have to want to be an extended VR user, if you will, if you're going to invest more than $500 into one of these systems," he says. And Google has had previous failures with augmented reality. Google Glass was a flop with consumers because the company didn't think through the privacy implications. Google's VR headset will be out the end of this year and so will new augmented reality-capable smartphones. There's still no word on price.

And by everywhere, I don't just mean at the heart of its Android operating system and deeply integrated into apps like Photos and Maps — or powering its smart speaker Home. No, to ensure that Assistant has as wide a reach as possible, Google is now making its Assistant No, to ensure that Assistant has as wide a reach as possible, Google is now making its Assistant available on the iPhone. Apple of course already has Siri, but Google believes that its technology is superior and therefore believes it can convince iPhone users to switch from saying “Hey Siri” to “OK Google” and in turn ensure that it gobbles up as much of our data as possible. The move was announced during the opening keynote of Google I/O, the search giant’s annual developer conference in Silicon Valley on Wednesday evening. Assistant was the star of the 90-minute presentation which is nominally aimed at developers, but which played much more to the end-user this year. What about Android? An indication of the backseat Google gave to Android — the world’s biggest smartphone operating system, currently powering 2 billion devices — was the fact that it wasn’t even mentioned until 75 minutes into the 90-minute presentation. This is a significant shift for Google and indicates that while voice is far from becoming ubiquitous, it is clearly where Google sees computing moving in the future. Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research, believes the keynote “was reflective of a shift we’ve seen from Google in recent years, in which it’s de-emphasized the core Android operating system while shifting focus to individual apps that run on top of it.” And the app which is most important to Google today is Assistant. The reason Google is shifting focus away from Android and onto services like Assistant — as well as Google Photos and the new augmented reality Google Lens app — is that Google has lost control of Android. The manufacturers and networks now control the upgrade cycle and push their services on top of the core Android experience. By expanding the reach of Assistant beyond just Android devices, Google is hoping that it will continue to attract new users and therefore continue to help it grow its own core business — selling ads. The more Google knows about its users, the better it is at selling ads. This is why Google requires users to sign in with a Google account to use the service. Even on the iPhone where Google could access Apple’s contacts and calendar app data, it chooses not to, focusing instead on its own ecosystem of apps. Available on all your devices Assistant on the iPhone won’t be the same experience as Assistant on Google’s Pixel phones. You can’t just say “OK Google” and have the app launch; you will need to manually tap on it. But once you do, the range of things you can do is much wider. You can ask it to translate words into any language you like; you can get it to play movies on your Chromecast-connected TVs; you can type questions rather than speak them, and you can even ask it to sing. Now available on 100M+ devices, your #GoogleAssistant is your own personal Google, always ready to help. #io17 pic.twitter.com/MwlKhtgL6M — Google (@Google) May 17, 2017 But smartphones are just the start for Google Assistant. As I mentioned, Assistant powers Google Home, the smart speaker that allows you play music and control smart home devices with your voice. At Google I/O on Wednesday the company announced it was adding the ability to make calls through Home (though only in the US and Canada initially) as well as support for a wider range of services and hardware. Assistant is also available on smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0; it is coming to Android TV; and will soon be deeply integrated in the embedded in the consoles and infotainment systems of cars from Volvo and Audi. Just as we saw dozens of hardware manufacturers integrate Amazon’s Alexa into their products earlier this year, expect to see “Powered by Google Assistant” on even more devices — from speakers to fridges, TVs, ovens and everything else in your smart home. Google foresaw the move away from desktop computing and towards mobile, and with Android, it has come to dominate that world. Now it clearly sees another shift, away from tapping and typing and towards voice. With Assistant Google is hoping to continue to dominate our computing lives. 12:00 20 May 2017 David Gilbert 20 hours ago most popular latest sport #PornWeek: The A to Z - by way of XXX - of pornography Billy Joe Padden gives his take on Mayo's Aidan O'Shea situation GALLERY: Monaghan beat Fermanagh to advance in Ulster Pat Lam: "The whole country is special" site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us SafetyNet integrates with Google Play Console, app developers have choice not to show app to certain devices By John Hoff - May 20, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Last week, there was an uproar in the aftermarket development community when the Netflix app would not appear in Google Play Store search queries coming from rooted devices. Something was blocking it from showing up in Play Store queries, and Netflix said that it was indeed blocking unsupported devices. But at Google I/O 2017, the announcement of some new features to Google Play shed light to this issue. Apparently, what we have here is a new feature of Google Play Console. Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management – this will let developers choose to a very granular degree which devices their app will support on the Play Store. To put it plainly, developers can exclude devices by many attributes including RAM, SoC, and interestingly, SafetyNet Attestation. If the developers choose – from three options – to block their app from appearing for devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don’t pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren’t certified by Google, then you will have the Netflix issue. This means that any developer could now block their apps from showing and being directly installable from the Play Store on devices that are rooted, running a custom ROM, or those running from emulators and uncertified devices. How the aftermarket community will react to this will be interesting, because it feels like custom ROMs and rooted devices are being targeted here. However, this is not the first time it has happened, and we have seen the community rise up from things like this.

The PM is speaking repeatedly to ensure trust: Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi The castaways of the food chain Home Technology Tech News Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race Google woos developers to catch Amazon in digital assistant race Google's vision of future computing involves you interacting with your Google Assistant in an inclusive manner however now Amazon is closer to that goal. By: Bloomberg | San Francisco | Updated: May 20, 2017 8:21 pm Here is Google’s vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, “Ok, Google,” triggering the company’s Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it’s ready when you arrive. Right now, Amazon.com Inc. and its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realizing that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor Co. to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles. That’s just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers’ lives. What’s more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers — an area where Google has struggled. Amazon’s Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google’s rival Home device only came out late last year. “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways,” said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com, a website about voice-based commerce and computing. “Google is trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that have a voice. That philosophy limits its ability to really go after Amazon.” Central to Alexa’s appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google’s tally. The Alphabet Inc. unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon’s lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful. The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music. “A lot of what you need to get done is transactional,” said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. “We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts.” Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers. Also Read:  Why Google Assistant fails to crack Apple’s iPhone ecosystem It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant. It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon’s Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills — the equivalent of an app for Amazon’s voice-based system — up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built by outside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn’t available publicly yet. Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organizing web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. (Image for representation, Source: Reuters) Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organizing information from the web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions. Take cooking recipes, an early use for hands-free speakers. By November, Alexa could talk budding home chefs through more than 60,000 recipes. That came from a Skills integration with the cooking app Allrecipes. The latest Echo Look device, with a screen, is particularly well suited to voice-based kitchen use because it can show people recipes, as well as tell them about ingredients and cooking steps. Also Read:  Google I/O 2017 live updates: Android Go project, Daydream VR headset, Google for Jobs, and more Bloomberg News asked Google’s Assistant to talk to Allrecipes on Friday afternoon, and the digital helper sent web links rather than an integrated voice-based Action. However, the Assistant has access to 45,000 recipe websites that have already been marked up with special code that lets Google’s software read out ingredients and other related information, Hafsteinsson said. “Google has better understanding. It has been working on AI much longer,”said Patricia Carando, a mobile developer attending the I/O conference. She’s been working on an Alexa Skill, but she was learning how to create an Action for Google’s Assistant during coding classes at the event on Thursday. Eventually, consumers will pick one digital assistant “and stick with it,” pushing developers to mostly build on that platform, she added. A deep concern for Google is that more people will stick with Amazon or a potential device from other competitors like Apple Inc. That’s behind Google’s rush to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. There are about 70 outside companies working with Google to sync things like dishwashers, fridges and light bulbs to the voice-based platform, including GE Appliances, Osram Lighting and Leviton, the internet giant said. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. Even so, Amazon is making the most of its earlier start. The day before I/O began, a new Amazon program emerged for outside developers working with the company’s Alexa digital assistant, which controls its Echo devices and a rising number of other gadgets. If users talk a lot to a developer’s Alexa Skill, then Amazon will send a reward of cold hard cash, according to note posted Amazon’s Alexa developer website. On Amazon’s website, there are hundreds of home devices already for sale that work with Alexa, made by roughly 30 companies such as Samsung Electronics Co., Philips and Wink. Google is taking pains to show how easy it is to use its tools. During an I/O demo in front of a packed crowd of developers on Thursday, a Google engineer built a simple Action for the Assistant that turned on a set of virtual light bulbs, then turned them green, by voice. The company is working on “What it means to be a washing machine,” the engineer said, to giggles from some in the audience. Also Read: Google Home’s assistant can now recognise up to six different voices Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organizing web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. Discerning what consumers want to hear from their voice-based devices is new territory. At an another panel during the week, Google engineers showed developers a list of criteria the company uses to decide what Actions and other data to surface within its new Assistant world. Those included questions about whether end users had to repeat requests, learned something or “LOL” (laughed out loud). The company rarely exposes such specific guidelines. It’s famously secretive about these types of criteria when it comes to search results, to avoid website developers gaming the system and ruining the experience. The fact that it’s being so open, shows how eager it is to lure a new army of outside voice-based developers. “Please, please think about those things,” Valerie Nygaard, a Google product manager, told the audience. “These are the questions we ask ourselves.” For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now Tags: Amazon Google No Comments.

Here's how Google, Facebook constitute an effective duopoly on online Australian media Ben Eltham | The Conversation  May 20, 2017 Last Updated at 15:34 IST email this article Message: Recipients' Email: Type address separated by commas Your Email: Enter the characters shown in the image. Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UVlOXQ ALSO READ Facebook introduces new doodle programme to compete with Google Why the media is a key dimension of global inequality Google's YouTube battle with big brands may shake up how content is shared San Bernardino attack: Facebook, Google, Twitter sued over aiding terrorism 10 ways the tech industry and the media helped create President Trump There was a fascinating moment towards the end of Wednesday’s hearings of the Senate Inquiry into the Future of Public Interest Journalism. Journalist Michael West was at the stand. West’s experience is in many ways emblematic. Once a marquee investigator for Fairfax Media with multiple scoops to his name, West was made redundant in one of Fairfax’s seemingly endless rounds of job shedding in recent years. He used his redundancy cheque to found a startup, MichaelWest.com.au, and took a position as an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. West has long been a dogged investigator of corporate excess. He pointed out to the hearing that articles he and Neil Chenoweth wrote while at Fairfax several years ago had led directly to a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. The findings of that inquiry – that multinationals like Google and Apple were sending most of their Australian revenues offshore, and paying just cents in the dollar in tax – resulted in tighter laws for global corporations hiding profits in offshore accounts. “As a result of that, in the budget last week, [Treasurer] Scott Morrison said that they were expecting $2.9 billion rather than $2 billion, as originally anticipated, from just seven companies,” West said. So, as a result of political action from the Senate and public interest journalism, there is a billion dollars cash— bang! West added that sources in the Australian Tax Office told him that “there are behavioural changes in the way that multinational companies are regarding this issue of how aggressive they can be on the tax front” and that the ATO is “expecting billions of dollars to flow from that”. Committee member Senator Nick Xenophon then quipped: If only you got one-tenth of one per cent of that, Mr West. Public interest journalism is important for many reasons, including the vital role it plays in holding the powerful to account. But few would have predicted it would play such an instrumental role in plugging Australia’s leaky company tax base. The senate inquiry comes at an important time. With Fairfax Media at play in the stock market and yet more redundancies at the big newspaper publisher announced, for-profit journalism in Australia has never seemed so vulnerable. The market dominance of the two US tech giants Google and Facebook is such that they constitute an effective duopoly on online Australian media. These two companies now control the majority of the eyeballs of ordinary Australians. A single graph from market research firm Nielsen best illustrates this. You can see that Facebook and Google have reached almost total saturation of the Australian audience in terms of “active reach” (the percentage of people accessing a particular site or platform). Not only do they have the two largest audiences, but they also soak up the most time spent online. Google’s true size is actually obscured by the fact that its subsidiary YouTube is broken out; YouTube and Facebook are ranked one and two for streaming in Australia. When it comes to advertising, the duopoly is just as entrenched. A tweet by analyst Jason Kint went viral in late 2016. He estimated that Facebook and Google’s collective share of global digital advertising revenue was about 70%. All the growth in advertising revenue is being captured by the two duopolists; astonishingly, ad revenue outside the twin giants was actually falling. Given that advertising is increasingly digital and online, the two companies have quickly established market dominance. Australian regulators have been slow to react. While Google is finally beginning to pay a meaningful amount of company tax here, there is apparently no appetite amongst competition or media regulators to come to grips with the digital duopoly. After the ACCC’s embarassing defeat in the High Court in its 2013 case against Google over whether its sponsored links constituted misleading and deceptive conduct, there has been no further attempt to address the company’s market power. When it comes to media regulation, the touch is even lighter. The majority of the content streamed in Australia through YouTube and Netflix is foreign; the Turnbull government has no plans to implement local content quotas on digital streaming. Communications Minister Mitch Fifield has just announced a sweeping deregulation of the existing, weak media policy regime. Google and Facebook are also increasingly important in the distribution of news. The US presidential election and the British referendum on leaving Europe were both marked by massive digital advertising campaigns, often from parties outside the democratic process, that sought to directly influence the outcome. The flap over “fake news” has been dismissed by some as merely the latest example of an eternal phenomenon. That would seem to underestimate the problem. The rise of Facebook and Google as aggregators has made it much easier than before to mimic the appearance and feel of legitimate news sites to produce authentic-looking, hyper-partisan news fakery. A BuzzFeed investigation in 2016 found that “fake news” was shared more widely than real news in the last month of the US presidential election campaign. While some was authored by Macedonian teenagers, much was politically motivated and funded by unknown sources. The Data & Society Research Institute has recently published an authoritative report concluding that: the spread of false or misleading information is having real and negative effects on the public consumption of news. What can be done? As the inquiry heard this week, advertising once paid for muscular news organisations in the private sector. It doesn’t any more. The dominance of the aggregators now poses a real challenge to the continued existence of a robust fourth estate, outside of publicly funded media. Still, while regulators have failed to keep up with the rapid pace of industry change, there are models available to address the current malaise. The future of public-interest journalism and the question of what to do about Google and Facebook have been examined in detail in previous government inquiries. In 2011 and 2012, the Gillard government commissioned the Independent Media Inquiry, chaired by Ray Finkelstein, and the Convergence Review, chaired by Glen Boreham. In the feverish atmosphere of the late Gillard government, neither report gained any political traction. Hardly any of their recommendations were taken up. That’s a shame, because they included some valuable suggestions. Local content quotas for free-to-air television are set at 55% in prime time. Rather than impose quotas on overseas digital media companies, Boreham suggested the idea of a “converged content production fund” - partly funded by a levy on them. It could support a range of journalism funding pools, just as the Australia Council or Screen Australia currently distribute funding for particular goals. (It could support, for instance, programs for investigative journalism, grants to news publishers, funding for community newsrooms, and so on). Finkelstein’s inquiry recommended the government consider a public interest journalism fund that would directly subsidise news organisations to conduct investigative journalism. He argued: The subsidy could be defined as a percentage of the wage bill of dedicated investigative journalism units established by publishers. It would be paid annually on the basis of eligible payroll cost in the preceding year. We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. We could levy Google and Facebook say, 25% of their domestic advertising revenue and redirect this to fund Australian journalism and other content. Doing so would take Australia towards a more European model of media regulation and subsidy, in which the state plays a prominent role in feeding the hand that bites it. Countries like France and Norway directly fund for-profit media companies, and yet still maintain media diversity and freedom of expression. Norway’s recent bipartisan Commission of Media Diversity, for instance, recommended direct subsidies and tax breaks for newspapers and broadcasters, as well as grants to online media and investigative journalists. While many journalists remain understandably uncomfortable about state funding of the private media, such an outcome may be preferable to the current trend towards declining trust, vanishing scrutiny and fewer and fewer paid jobs in journalism.

Here's how Google, Facebook constitute an effective duopoly on online Australian media Google, Facebook constitute an effective duopoly on online Australian media There was a fascinating moment towards the end of Wednesday’s hearings of the Senate Inquiry into the Future of Public Interest Journalism. Journalist Michael West was at the stand. West’s experience is in many ways emblematic. Once a marquee investigator for Fairfax Media with multiple scoops to his name, West was made redundant in one of Fairfax’s seemingly endless rounds of job shedding in recent years. He used his redundancy cheque to found a startup, MichaelWest.com.au, and took a position as an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. West has long been a dogged investigator of corporate excess. He pointed out to the hearing that articles he and Neil Chenoweth wrote while at Fairfax several years ago had led directly to a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. The findings of that inquiry – that multinationals like Google and Apple were sending most of their Australian revenues offshore, and paying just cents in the dollar in tax – resulted in tighter laws for global corporations hiding profits in offshore accounts. “As a result of that, in the budget last week, [Treasurer] Scott Morrison said that they were expecting $2.9 billion rather than $2 billion, as originally anticipated, from just seven companies,” West said. So, as a result of political action from the Senate and public interest journalism, there is a billion dollars cash— bang! West added that sources in the Australian Tax Office told him that “there are behavioural changes in the way that multinational companies are regarding this issue of how aggressive they can be on the tax front” and that the ATO is “expecting billions of dollars to flow from that”. Committee member Senator Nick Xenophon then quipped: If only you got one-tenth of one per cent of that, Mr West. Public interest journalism is important for many reasons, including the vital role it plays in holding the powerful to account.

For months, American spy hunters had scrambled to uncover details of Russia’s influence operation against the 2016 presidential election. In offices in both D.C. and suburban Virginia, they had created massive wall charts to track the different players in Russia’s multipronged scheme. But the report in early March was something new. Quotes in the article Analytica Ltd ALT = 0.0050 0.0000 0.00% Rand Capital Corp RAND = 2.90 0.00 0.00% Graham Holdings Co GHC ▲ 600.40 +8.90 +1.50% Melco International Development Ltd MDEVF = 2.25 0.00 0.00% It described how Russia had already moved on from the rudimentary email hacks against politicians it had used in 2016. Now the Russians were running a more sophisticated hack on Twitter. The report said the Russians had sent expertly tailored messages carrying malware to more than 10,000 Twitter users in the Defense Department. Depending on the interests of the targets, the messages offered links to stories on recent sporting events or the Oscars, which had taken place the previous weekend. When clicked, the links took users to a Russian-controlled server that downloaded a program allowing Moscow’s hackers to take control of the victim’s phone or computer-and Twitter account. As they scrambled to contain the damage from the hack and regain control of any compromised devices, the spy hunters realized they faced a new kind of threat. In 2016, Russia had used thousands of covert human agents and robot computer programs to spread disinformation referencing the stolen campaign emails of Hillary Clinton, amplifying their effect. Now counterintelligence officials wondered: What chaos could Moscow unleash with thousands of Twitter handles that spoke in real time with the authority of the armed forces of the United States? At any given moment, perhaps during a natural disaster or a terrorist attack, Pentagon Twitter accounts might send out false information. As each tweet corroborated another, and covert Russian agents amplified the messages even further afield, the result could be panic and confusion. For many Americans, Russian hacking remains a story about the 2016 election. But there is another story taking shape. Marrying a hundred years of expertise in influence operations to the new world of social media, Russia may finally have gained the ability it long sought but never fully achieved in the Cold War: to alter the course of events in the U.S. by manipulating public opinion. The vast openness and anonymity of social media has cleared a dangerous new route for antidemocratic forces. "Using these technologies, it is possible to undermine democratic government, and it’s becoming easier every day," says Rand Waltzman of the Rand Corp., who ran a major Pentagon research program to understand the propaganda threats posed by social media technology. Current and former officials at the FBI, at the CIA and in Congress now believe the 2016 Russian operation was just the most visible battle in an ongoing information war against global democracy. And they’ve become more vocal about their concern. "If there has ever been a clarion call for vigilance and action against a threat to the very foundation of our democratic political system, this episode is it," former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified before Congress on May 8.

As they tweet and like and upvote their way through social media, Americans generate a vast trove of data on what they think and how they respond to ideas and arguments-literally thousands of expressions of belief every second on Twitter, Facebook, Reddit and Google. All of those digitized convictions are collected and stored, and much of that data is available commercially to anyone with sufficient computing power to take advantage of it. That’s where the algorithms come in. American researchers have found they can use mathematical formulas to segment huge populations into thousands of subgroups according to defining characteristics like religion and political beliefs or taste in TV shows and music. Other algorithms can determine those groups’ hot-button issues and identify "followers" among them, pinpointing those most susceptible to suggestion. Propagandists can then manually craft messages to influence them, deploying covert provocateurs, either humans or automated computer programs known as bots, in hopes of altering their behavior. Load Error That is what Moscow is doing, more than a dozen senior intelligence officials and others investigating Russia’s influence operations tell TIME. The Russians "target you and see what you like, what you click on, and see if you’re sympathetic or not sympathetic," says a senior intelligence official. Whether and how much they have actually been able to change Americans’ behavior is hard to say. But as they have investigated the Russian 2016 operation, intelligence and other officials have found that Moscow has developed sophisticated tactics. In one case last year, senior intelligence officials tell TIME, a Russian soldier based in Ukraine successfully infiltrated a U.S. social media group by pretending to be a 42-year-old American housewife and weighing in on political debates with specially tailored messages. In another case, officials say, Russia created a fake Facebook account to spread stories on political issues like refugee resettlement to targeted reporters they believed were susceptible to influence. As Russia expands its cyberpropaganda efforts, the U.S. and its allies are only just beginning to figure out how to fight back. One problem: the fear of Russian influence operations can be more damaging than the operations themselves. Eager to appear more powerful than they are, the Russians would consider it a success if you questioned the truth of your news sources, knowing that Moscow might be lurking in your Facebook or Twitter feed. But figuring out if they are is hard. Uncovering "signals that indicate a particular handle is a state-sponsored account is really, really difficult," says Jared Cohen, president of Jigsaw, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which tackles global security challenges. Like many a good spy tale, the story of how the U.S. learned its democracy could be hacked started with loose lips. In May 2016, a Russian military intelligence officer bragged to a colleague that his organization, known as the GRU, was getting ready to pay Clinton back for what President Vladimir Putin believed was an influence operation she had run against him five years earlier as Secretary of State. The GRU, he said, was going to cause chaos in the upcoming U.S. election. What the officer didn’t know, senior intelligence officials tell TIME, was that U.S. spies were listening. They wrote up the conversation and sent it back to analysts at headquarters, who turned it from raw intelligence into an official report and circulated it. But if the officer’s boast seems like a red flag now, at the time U.S. officials didn’t know what to make of it. "We didn’t really understand the context of it until much later," says the senior intelligence official. Investigators now realize that the officer’s boast was the first indication U.S. spies had from their sources that Russia wasn’t just hacking email accounts to collect intelligence but was also considering interfering in the vote. Like much of America, many in the U.S. government hadn’t imagined the kind of influence operation that Russia was preparing to unleash on the 2016 election. Fewer still realized it had been five years in the making. In 2011, protests in more than 70 cities across Russia had threatened Putin’s control of the Kremlin. The uprising was organized on social media by a popular blogger named Alexei Navalny, who used his blog as well as Twitter and Facebook to get crowds in the streets. Putin’s forces broke out their own social media technique to strike back. When bloggers tried to organize nationwide protests on Twitter using #Triumfalnaya, pro-Kremlin botnets bombarded the hashtag with anti-protester messages and nonsense tweets, making it impossible for Putin’s opponents to coalesce. Putin publicly accused then Secretary of State Clinton of running a massive influence operation against his country, saying she had sent "a signal" to protesters and that the State Department had actively worked to fuel the protests. The State Department said it had just funded pro-democracy organizations. Former officials say any such operations-in Russia or elsewhere-would require a special intelligence finding by the President and that Barack Obama was not likely to have issued one. After his re-election the following year, Putin dispatched his newly installed head of military intelligence, Igor Sergun, to begin repurposing cyberweapons previously used for psychological operations in war zones for use in electioneering. Russian intelligence agencies funded "troll farms," botnet spamming operations and fake news outlets as part of an expanding focus on psychological operations in cyberspace. It turns out Putin had outside help. One particularly talented Russian programmer who had worked with social media researchers in the U.S. for 10 years had returned to Moscow and brought with him a trove of algorithms that could be used in influence operations. He was promptly hired by those working for Russian intelligence services, senior intelligence officials tell TIME. "The engineer who built them the algorithms is U.S.-trained," says the senior intelligence official. Soon, Putin was aiming his new weapons at the U.S. Following Moscow’s April 2014 invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. considered sanctions that would block the export of drilling and fracking technologies to Russia, putting out of reach some $8.2 trillion in oil reserves that could not be tapped without U.S. technology. As they watched Moscow’s intelligence operations in the U.S., American spy hunters saw Russian agents applying their new social media tactics on key aides to members of Congress. Moscow’s agents broadcast material on social media and watched how targets responded in an attempt to find those who might support their cause, the senior intelligence official tells TIME. "The Russians started using it on the Hill with staffers," the official says, "to see who is more susceptible to continue this program [and] to see who would be more favorable to what they want to do." On Aug. 7, 2016, the infamous pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli declared that Hillary Clinton had Parkinson’s. That story went viral in late August, then took on a life of its own after Clinton fainted from pneumonia and dehydration at a Sept. 11 event in New York City. Elsewhere people invented stories saying Pope Francis had endorsed Trump and Clinton had murdered a DNC staffer. Just before Election Day, a story took off alleging that Clinton and her aides ran a pedophile ring in the basement of a D.C. pizza parlor. Congressional investigators are looking at how Russia helped stories like these spread to specific audiences. Counterintelligence officials, meanwhile, have picked up evidence that Russia tried to target particular influencers during the election season who they reasoned would help spread the damaging stories. These officials have seen evidence of Russia using its algorithmic techniques to target the social media accounts of particular reporters, senior intelligence officials tell TIME. "It’s not necessarily the journal or the newspaper or the TV show," says the senior intelligence official. "It’s the specific reporter that they find who might be a little bit slanted toward believing things, and they’ll hit him" with a flood of fake news stories. Russia plays in every social media space. The intelligence officials have found that Moscow’s agents bought ads on Facebook to target specific populations with propaganda. "They buy the ads, where it says sponsored by-they do that just as much as anybody else does," says the senior intelligence official. (A Facebook official says the company has no evidence of that occurring.) The ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, Mark Warner of Virginia, has said he is looking into why, for example, four of the top five Google search results the day the U.S. released a report on the 2016 operation were links to Russia’s TV propaganda arm, RT. (Google says it saw no meddling in this case.) Researchers at the University of Southern California, meanwhile, found that nearly 20% of political tweets in 2016 between Sept. 16 and Oct. 21 were generated by bots of unknown origin; investigators are trying to figure out how many were Russian. As they dig into the viralizing of such stories, congressional investigations are probing not just Russia’s role but whether Moscow had help from the Trump campaign. Sources familiar with the investigations say they are probing two Trump-linked organizations: Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics company hired by the campaign that is partly owned by deep-pocketed Trump backer Robert Mercer; and Breitbart News, the right-wing website formerly run by Trump’s top political adviser Stephen Bannon. The congressional investigators are looking at ties between those companies and right-wing web personalities based in Eastern Europe who the U.S. believes are Russian fronts, a source familiar with the investigations tells TIME. "Nobody can prove it yet," the source says. In March, McClatchy newspapers reported that FBI counterintelligence investigators were probing whether far-right sites like Breitbart News and Infowars had coordinated with Russian botnets to blitz social media with anti-Clinton stories, mixing fact and fiction when Trump was doing poorly in the campaign. There are plenty of people who are skeptical of such a conspiracy, if one existed. Cambridge Analytica touts its ability to use algorithms to microtarget voters, but veteran political operatives have found them ineffective political influencers. Ted Cruz first used their methods during the primary, and his staff ended up concluding they had wasted their money. Mercer, Bannon, Breitbart News and the White House did not answer questions about the congressional probes. A spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica says the company has no ties to Russia or individuals acting as fronts for Moscow and that it is unaware of the probe. Democratic operatives searching for explanations for Clinton’s loss after the election investigated social media trends in the three states that tipped the vote for Trump: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. In each they found what they believe is evidence that key swing voters were being drawn to fake news stories and anti-Clinton stories online. Google searches for the fake pedophilia story circulating under the hashtag #pizzagate, for example, were disproportionately higher in swing districts and not in districts likely to vote for Trump. The Democratic operatives created a package of background materials on what they had found, suggesting the search behavior might indicate that someone had successfully altered the behavior in key voting districts in key states. They circulated it to fellow party members who are up for a vote in 2018.© Brendan Smialowski-AFP/Getty Images Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper calls Russian cyber­ influence operations a threat to democracy Even as investigators try to piece together what happened in 2016, they are worrying about what comes next. Russia claims to be able to alter events using cyberpropaganda and is doing what it can to tout its power. In February 2016, a Putin adviser named Andrey Krutskikh compared Russia’s information-warfare strategies to the Soviet Union’s obtaining a nuclear weapon in the 1940s, David Ignatius of the Washington Post reported. "We are at the verge of having something in the information arena which will allow us to talk to the Americans as equals," Krutskikh said. But if Russia is clearly moving forward, it’s less clear how active the U.S. has been. Documents released by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and published by the Intercept suggested that the British were pursuing social media propaganda and had shared their tactics with the U.S. Chris Inglis, the former No. 2 at the National Security Agency, says the U.S. has not pursued this capability. "The Russians are 10 years ahead of us in being willing to make use of" social media to influence public opinion, he says. There are signs that the U.S. may be playing in this field, however. From 2010 to 2012, the U.S. Agency for International Development established and ran a "Cuban Twitter" network designed to undermine communist control on the island. At the same time, according to the Associated Press, which discovered the program, the U.S. government hired a contractor to profile Cuban cell phone users, categorizing them as "pro-revolution," "apolitical" or "antirevolutionary." Much of what is publicly known about the mechanics and techniques of social media propaganda comes from a program at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) that the Rand researcher, Waltzman, ran to study how propagandists might manipulate social media in the future. In the Cold War, operatives might distribute disinformation-laden newspapers to targeted political groups or insinuate an agent provocateur into a group of influential intellectuals. By harnessing computing power to segment and target literally millions of people in real time online, Waltzman concluded, you could potentially change behavior "on the scale of democratic governments." In the U.S., public scrutiny of such programs is usually enough to shut them down. In 2014, news articles appeared about the DARPA program and the "Cuban Twitter" project. It was only a year after Snowden had revealed widespread monitoring programs by the government. The DARPA program, already under a cloud, was allowed to expire quietly when its funding ran out in 2015. In the wake of Russia’s 2016 election hack, the question is how to research social media propaganda without violating civil liberties. The need is all the more urgent because the technology continues to advance. While today humans are still required to tailor and distribute messages to specially targeted "susceptibles," in the future crafting and transmitting emotionally powerful messages will be automated.© Illustration by Ben Wiseman for TIME The U.S. government is constrained in what kind of research it can fund by various laws protecting citizens from domestic propaganda, government electioneering and intrusions on their privacy. Waltzman has started a group called Information Professionals Association with several former information operations officers from the U.S. military to develop defenses against social media influence operations. Social media companies are beginning to realize that they need to take action. Facebook issued a report in April 2017 acknowledging that much disinformation had been spread on its pages and saying it had expanded its security. Google says it has seen no evidence of Russian manipulation of its search results but has updated its algorithms just in case. Twitter claims it has diminished cyberpropaganda by tweaking its algorithms to block cleverly designed bots. "Our algorithms currently work to detect when Twitter accounts are attempting to manipulate Twitter’s Trends through inorganic activity, and then automatically adjust," the company said in a statement. In the meantime, America’s best option to protect upcoming votes may be to make it harder for Russia and other bad actors to hide their election-related information operations. When it comes to defeating Russian influence operations, the answer is "transparency, transparency, transparency," says Rhode Island Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. He has written legislation that would curb the massive, anonymous campaign contributions known as dark money and the widespread use of shell corporations that he says make Russian cyberpropaganda harder to trace and expose. But much damage has already been done. "The ultimate impact of [the 2016 Russian operation] is we’re never going to look at another election without wondering, you know, Is this happening, can we see it happening?" says Jigsaw’s Jared Cohen. By raising doubts about the validity of the 2016 vote and the vulnerability of future elections, Russia has achieved its most important objective: undermining the credibility of American democracy. For now, investigators have added the names of specific trolls and botnets to their wall charts in the offices of intelligence and law-enforcement agencies. They say the best way to compete with the Russian model is by having a better message. "It requires critical thinkers and people who have a more powerful vision" than the cynical Russian view, says former NSA deputy Inglis. And what message is powerful enough to take on the firehose of falsehoods that Russia is deploying in targeted, effective ways across a range of new media? One good place to start: telling the truth. -With reporting by PRATHEEK REBALA/WASHINGTON This article was originally published on TIME.com Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices [Update] Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares191 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not. It appears that Pay has been fixed via a server-side update, which is why some people who have had trouble updating their Nexuses can now use the Pay app.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it. Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory and OTA images are now available to download.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? Dn Bro No it's oem unlocking option https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e5b64da4b008176fb08c064f9e16566252aa48001e2ccb59231062d5af2a2dd4.png ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Martial Clausse After a day or two, all the crashes seem to have gone away automagically... It was bad, I couldn't read my emails and so on, but now everything works... So I'll keep this as a daily driver :) Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary).

I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O.

Since the announcement, there has been a lot of confusion regarding the project - is it a new version of Android? Can Android Go devices run all Android apps, or only the apps that have been optimised for the Go experience? How will this impact OS updates for consumers, and what will developers need to do differently to optimise their apps for Android Go? Unfortunately, in the immediate aftermath of the keynote, Google didn’t provide answers to a lot of these questions, and there isn’t a lot of information related to Android Go up on Google’s websites either. Thankfully, to answer all these queries - and a whole lot more - we managed to get some time with Sameer Samat, the man who introduced Android Go on stage on Wednesday, and the VP of Product Management for Android and Google Play. Here’s a FAQ on Android Go based on the answers Gadgets 360 got from Samat and other Google executives here in Mountain View. Is Android Go a new version of Android? Samat couldn’t be clearer on this: “Android Go is not a new version of Android, it’s not a different Android, it’s a project name inside Google.” What will be the Android version that Go devices will ship with? “We call it Android Go - it’s an internal name - but the OS that these partners will be shipping will be Android O - there’s no separate OS called Android Go,” Samat explains, just to drive home the point. So what will be different about Android Go devices? Think of Android Go as a bunch of presets that your Android O device will ship with. Some OS settings will be switched on (or off) by default; some Google apps will be a bit different than other Android O devices; and the Google Play Store will highlight third-party apps optimised for the Go experience - that’s about it. “The way this works is that Android has a configuration when you build a device in factory and we are effectively putting a Go configuration in place, which is very similar to what do with Svelte so if the device is low-RAM, for example, when the device is built in the factory, it's configured, right,” Samat explains. “It's not something the user decides, it's something that the OEM decides at the factory and what we are saying is if you are gonna build a device that’s 1GB or less [RAM] then you should build it with the Go OS configuration, so you should use Android O, but you should use these configuration settings.” When asked to detail some of these changes, Samat says, “[..] when in Svelte, as far back as KitKat, there’s a number of things that the device will do to optimise the UI, so when it detects that it's low RAM device, there’s a number of animations that are turned off, a number of things that are memory-intensive like that in the UI that are nice, but if they are done wrong - because they are memory-intensive - they can actually compromise the experience, as opposed to enhancing the experience, so those are some examples of optimisations.” “The other thing though is there are some feature that we are adding, so it's not just about taking away but about adding features. We mentioned yesterday in the keynote that data management is very important to users that are coming online today. So data management will go in Quick Settings as another example of the UI change. So there are some things that are added and some things that are modified.” Google Assistant Comes to iPhone, Understands Typing, and More The three cornerstones of Android Go Samat touched upon these points in his keynote on Wednesday, and he reiterates that Android Go “stands for three things - first, is continuing to optimise the Android operating system to run smoothly on entry-level devices, starting with Android O.” “Second, is making sure that Google apps that we load on these devices are also optimised, which means that we are rebuilding many of the Google apps. I showed in the keynote yesterday - YouTube Go, which is a new app entirely, which is much smaller in APK size, it uses less data, and gives users much more control over data and how they use it, which is very important” “And then finally, it’s not just the Google apps, but also we have many developers that make apps, so we are optimising the Play Store to highlight the apps that are tuned to the needs of users that are coming online for the first time.” Will Android Go device only be able to run apps optimised for the Go experience? Will the Google Play Store on Android Go devices only feature these apps? All Android apps that run on any ‘regular’ Android O device will also run on Android Go devices, barring of course any apps that may not be compatible with your hardware or not available in your region, something that’s the case even today with Android N (or earlier). “The Play Store on Go devices will contain the whole app catalog - no restrictions, unless the developer has a restriction, but the developer can do that today anyway, but no restrictions from Google on the apps,” Samat told Gadgets 360. In other words, the Google Play Store on Android Go devices will include all Android apps, not just apps optimised for Android Go devices. The latter will, however, be highlighted by Google prominently within the Play Store on Go devices, which might make it worth the developers’ time to optimise their apps if they want to target this audience. What about Google apps that ship by default on Android Go devices? In some cases, Google is developing an entirely new app optimised for Android Go devices. As demoed during the keynote, YouTube is one such example, and the YouTube Go app is now available via the Play Store for all devices (not just Android Go phones, see next question) to download and try out. This is the app that will ship by default on Android Go devices, instead of the ‘main’ YouTube app. Certain other apps, like Google Chrome, will just have a different configuration - but are still inherently the same app - and, indeed, other apps may be identical to their Android O counterparts in all ways. For apps like Chrome, the settings will not be locked to the defaults, and users will be free to change the behaviour to be more like on Android O. “For example Chrome has a feature called Data Saver, that will be turned on by default. Users can turn it off if they want, but it will be on by default,” says Samat. “On the other hand YouTube [for Go devices] is a new app, and YouTube Go has the features that the main YouTube app doesn't have. For example showing you the amount of data each video will take when you play. So some apps will be completely new and some apps will be loaded with a different configuration.” Gmail Gets Smart Reply Feature on Android, iOS Can Android Go devices install the ‘regular’ versions of their default apps? In a word - yes. In more than one word - Searching for YouTube on Google Play Store on Android Go devices will show the ‘regular’ YouTube app as well, and users will be free to install this app on their phone. How many users will actually do something like this when they already have a YouTube app on their phone is debatable, and most Go users - supposed first-time smartphone owners - are likely to go through the lifetime of the device without discovering the ‘main’ app. Now in the case of YouTube, specifically, the Go app looks pretty useful with features that the main app itself doesn’t have. But this lack of discoverability of the main app - to reiterate, why will a regular user search for YouTube in Play Store when the phone already has YouTube (Go) installed - might prove to be a problem in the future if, say, it gets a cool new feature before the Go app. Now just to be clear, there are no signs from Google that this will happen in the future, but with two different apps, it’s not entirely inconceivable. Can ‘regular’ Android devices run apps optimised for Android Go? Absolutely. While these apps are optimised for entry-level Android Go devices, there’s nothing stopping your Google Pixel XL or Samsung Galaxy S8, for example, from downloading and running, say, the YouTube Go app. These apps will also show up like any other app when you search for something via the Play Store on your device. How does Android Go differ from Android One? Let’s hear it from the man himself. “Android One was a specific project that focused on three things - first, specifying hardware [..] and we worked with manufactures to do that,” says Samat. “The second was any device that has the Android One brand would have the Google UI, unmodified by the partner. And the third piece was a commitment from the device manufacturer to have regular security updates.” “What we found over time is that a lot of the Android One proposition resonated with users. For example, there are a set of users who want the Google UI, and there were a set of users who wanted regular security updates, but that wasn’t just at the entry-level [as originally intended by the Android One program]. That was at the entry-level, the mid-tier, and the high-end.” “So Android One as a programme has evolved. We recommend hardware, but we no longer require certain hardware from OEMs, and we don’t focus on just the entry-level anymore either. For example, in Turkey we work with General Mobile, and they have a $200-$250 device. In Japan, Sharp and Qyocera, they have devices from $400 to $500. But they make a commitment to use the Google UI, and they make a commitment to do regular updates. So the Android One programme has evolved, and we are quite happy with how that’s evolving.” “And Android Go, again, is not a new version of Android, it’s a project name, and it’s focussed on the three things I mentioned before - optimising Android O, optimising the Google apps, and highlighting apps from the third-party ecosystem in the Play Store, and that’s how they [Android Go and Android One] are a little bit different.” Google Lens Visual Search Service Unveiled Will we see Android Go reference hardware? No such plans at the moment. Samat says Google thinks that “innovation coming from a lot of the hardware partners in different markets and globally is very strong right now in the entry-level [segment]”, and Google’s role will be limited to supporting the software side of things, in terms of making sure the OS is optimised so that OEMs “can use components that make sense”. He added that Google will be working “very closely” with partners that are interested in the Android Go configuration to make sure that “these devices perform well”. When will the first Android Go devices ship? And at what price points? As announced at the keynote, the first Android Go devices are expected to hit the market in 2018. In terms of price, Samat won’t commit to a number, saying that the objective of the Android Go project is “not to set a price point”. The idea, he explains, is to “allow manufacturers who are building entry-level devices to bring their price points as far down as they can” without compromising the overall experience. Why the 1GB RAM limit for Android Go devices? With many entry-level devices like the Rs. 6,999 (approximately $108) Xiaomi Redmi 4 shipping with 2GB of RAM, some might wonder why Google wants to optimise the experience for devices that may not represent a majority of smartphone shipments, especially by the time the first Android Go phone ships in 2018. We asked Samat to weigh in on the subject. “I think that the data that we are seeing from industry analysts and what our manufacturing partners tell us is that there are many, many devices shipping - millions of devices shipping - every year with 1GB [RAM] and below,” he says. As per Counterpoint’s Market Monitor data, smartphones with 1GB or less RAM accounted for more than one-fourth of the total smartphone shipments during Q1 2017 in India. “It is a sharp decline compared to last year, when contribution of the same segment was more than half of the total smartphone shipments,” Pavel Naiya, Senior Analyst, Devices and Analytics at Counterpoint tells Gadgets 360. “Even though market size of this segment (smartphones with 1GB or less RAM) has declined, there is enough pie left for Google to address with Android Go,” he adds. “One sizeable market is new entry-level smartphone users. As majority of the mobile phone users in India are still using feature phones and will eventually upgrade to entry-level smartphones.” Samat believes this number could go even higher with Android Go. “I think in some ways, device manufacturers are moving to add more and more memory because they want to make sure there’s a good experience, and what we are saying is that adds cost also,” he says. “So if we can make an experience that’s good with less RAM, then we believe people will wanna offer less expensive phones still with a good experience and you will see more of those phones ship.” Will Android Go make Android’s fragmentation problem worse - from a developer’s perspective? What about OEMs? Samat says Android Go is API identical to the ‘main’ Android O, so developers need not worry about fragmentation. For the OEMs, he believes they deal with enough old versions of Android that working with a single, different configuration of a new Android version will actually be a relief. “Most OEMs today manage many different branches because their entry-level devices are almost never shipping on the latest release of Android,” Samat says. “At least now, we want more of them to be shipping on the latest release of Android - there may be some build configurations in the factory that are different between the two [Android O and Android Go]. What we’ve heard from the manufacturers is that’s much easier for them to maintain than the multiple different versions of Android.” Will I see Android Go update on my existing device? Almost certainly no. Samat says the focus of the Android Go project is on new devices only, so don’t expect your existing entry-level phone to get Android O’s Go configuration.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more.

(David Donnelly/CBC) Ramona Pringle Technology Columnist Ramona Pringle is an associate professor in the RTA School of Media and director of the Transmedia Zone at Ryerson University. She is a CBC contributor who writes and reports on the relationship between people and technology. Related Stories Facebook says its mind-reading project is all about improving our lives. Yeah... right: Opinion In the world of technology, it all keeps coming back to privacy: Opinion Facebook kind of, somewhat continues to crack down on fake news: Opinion Google has its sights set on piloting its vision for the smart city of the future in Canada's largest urban centre. But its reasons for picking Toronto are not necessarily the ones we might first assume. Alphabet, Google's parent company, is eyeing Toronto for its foray into digital city-building. At first glance, it makes perfect sense. After all, Toronto is Canada's largest city and Canada is having a moment right now. The city has a lot going for it: it's a growing metropolis, a multicultural epicentre, and a new tech hotbed. Making Canada's capital a 'smart city' Your smartphone might help you build a better city But to understand the real reason Google is eyeing Toronto, it's important to look at their intent and take them at their word. Google says it wants to use technology to "fix" cities. Before news of the Toronto plans leaked, the company was said to be eyeing Detroit, a city of another era, now devastated by the fallout of a crumbling auto industry. Through that lens, the allure of Toronto as a venue for piloting a vision shifts slightly. One of the greatest appeals for Google isn't what Toronto has built, but what it hasn't. Namely, the city's under-developed industrial waterfront. Even if you've been to the city, you may not know that this part of the city even exists; with few businesses and fewer attractions, there's little to bring people to the area, despite its proximity to both the city centre and to stretches of Lake Ontario beach front. In other words, it is a 12-acre ghost town, inside of a growing, urban metropolis. Toronto's underdeveloped waterfront could be a perfect location for Google to begin developing a smart city. (CBC News) "Toronto has all of the conditions of being an innovative city that Google would be looking for," says Christopher De Sousa, the Director of Ryerson University's School of Urban and Regional Planning, adding that this "could be the catalytic spark that the city needs to get them to act on this inactive and underdeveloped area once and for all. There has been disagreement about what to do with the area for a hundred years, whether it is residential or business-driven — a smart city would bring both employment and housing — and do it in a futuristic innovative pilot model." The premise of Google's smart city is appealing. A city built from the ground up promises not just the convenience that comes with new technologies, but also the potential of environmental sustainability, health benefits, and even affordability of housing. The vision entails high-speed internet access and free wifi across the hub, self-driving cars, ride-sharing, and sensors throughout that automate the way people engage with their surroundings, making everything from street lights to air conditioning smarter and more efficient. 'From the internet up' If anyone can do it, it's Google. Having started as a search engine, they quickly expanded to help us communicate, navigate and even work. For the past year, they have been brainstorming what their version of this smart city might look like. And based on how quickly they've been able to saturate the online world, once they have the get-go from a city, this futuristic hub could become a reality pretty quickly. After all, the component parts aren't revolutionary: self-driving cars are already hitting the market, communities are opting for their own Fibre networks, and Amazon has taken care of some of the heavy lifting by testing out how sensors and data can change the retail experience with fully automated cashierless stores. Google just needs to bring it all together. The internet giant's plan is to build this new city "from the internet up." In that context, Toronto is the ideal place to begin, because it presents the perfect opportunity to showcase what the company is capable of without ruffling any feathers or raising real red flags. "You're not displacing low-income residents; you're not displacing high density jobs," says De Sousa. A still from a Waterfront Toronto animation that shows a developed eastern waterfront, just one vision of a revitalized waterfront. (CBC) Should their proposal be successful, they'd have buy-in from the city, which is currently seeking bids to revitalize the waterfront area, which would suggest an openness to adapting city bylaws to help this vision come to fruition; in fact, Google's vision goes beyond brick and mortar or digital bells and whistles, with hopes of reimagining zoning to make urban living more affordable. Surely, when it comes to setting themselves up for success as they venture into city planning, they couldn't have dreamed of anything more perfect than a sprawling no-man's land, just minutes away from the downtown airport and the financial district? But imagining this city-building venture in other Canadian cities, like Montreal, Ottawa, or Vancouver, brings to light some of its challenges, and some of the ethical issues we'll need to take into account sooner than later, should a pilot like this be successful and scale across the country with the same rapid growth that made the internet ubiquitous in the first place. Challenges in other cities Theoretically, if this demo comes to fruition, any of those major Canadian cities could be next. "Fixing" a city is one thing when you have under-developed urban land to work with. But as De Sousa points out, it's a whole different scenario when it entails changing the city's existing infrastructure. "Many big Canadian cities are under such development pressure already that to try to integrate this concept into existing neighbourhoods would be difficult; you have to consider long time residents, gentrification concerns, the displacement of high density jobs and the limitations of existing infrastructure. You don't have that when you're working with an under-developed area of land."  Bordered by water, Vancouver may not have the capacity for urban sprawl to allow for this kind of "from the internet up" approach without demolishing existing neighbourhoods. While the eventual smart hub might have a lot of appeal, bringing it to life in an already crowded urban centre would require displacing residents and local businesses.  Vancouver doesn't have the advantage of being underdeveloped the way Toronto does. (Christer Waara/CBC) And Montreal? Well, that's tricky for the same reason that building a city of the future in a European capital like Paris or Rome might be, where there is historic architecture built according to the plans of another era. Installing a strong fibre optic network is a lot more complicated when the city's architecture is protected by historical preservation efforts. And that's the point: to truly build the city of the future from the ground up necessitates that we demolish the city of the past. And that requires some thoughtful considerations about the trade-offs being made, questions that conveniently won't need to be asked if Google gets lucky and wins the bid for Toronto's waterfront.

He’s written a report for your reading. Comments and feedback welcome of course. I reckon it’s pretty good. By Yaseen Rana A mature century from Dawid Malan anchored Middlesex’s innings to put them into a decent position at the end of play on day two at Lord’s after they earlier managed to skittle Surrey’s lower order out in the first hour of play, to leave them with a first innings total of 313. Malan’s – was ably assisted by Eskinazi who scored 67 and James Franklin whose rapid – left Middlesex 296 for five overnight. Malan’s near-chanceless hundred, in which he was dropped badly by Borthwick on 85, took the game away from Surrey just as the game was evenly poised. In an extended day’s play, Surrey’s lower order folded, losing their last five wickets for just 48 runs thanks to a combination of spectacular fielding and rather average shot selection. Middlesex skipper James Franklin was the unlikely thorn in Surrey’s side taking four wickets – as many as he’s taken in all competitions this season. Ollie Rayner robbed the paying public of another Sangakkara masterclass as he added to his sharp take yesterday to dismiss Rory Burns with an even more impressive effort, low to his right to remove the overnight centurion. After losing the two Nicks, Gubbins and Compton, relatively cheaply Stevie Eskinazi and Dawid Malan were solid in Middlesex’s reply. Their partnership of exactly 100 put pressure on the Surrey bowlers with only Tom Curran offering any real control. Eskinazi looked in sublime touch barring his offer of a difficult chance to Borthwick at second slip. After every boundary he hits, Eskinazi walks up to the non-striker’s end and taps his bat in the popping crease; the kind of superstition that reminds you of Jonathan Trott. However it is another Warwickshire and England stalwart of the last decade that Eskinazi resembles more at the crease. His sumptuous timing and elegance is very much in the Ian Bell mould and his innings today showed why he’s probably moved above recent England batsman and teammate Nick Compton in the Middlesex batting pecking order. On the whole, Surrey’s pace attack bowled potently even if they were a bit inconsistent at times. Mark Footitt was Mark Footitt and went at around five an hour for most of the day whilst still being their most threatening bowler, taking three wickets. When he trapped John Simpson LBW for 11, Middlesex were in a spot of bother, 109 runs behind Surrey’s total with five wickets in hand. An excellent stand from an attacking James Franklin and Malan put Middlesex on top at the end of the day. Franklin reached his fifty, with two sixes off Scott Borthwick, off only 38 balls and his innings brought an exciting end to a day of high quality, closely fought cricket. With the new ball available first thing on day three, Surrey will be looking to have the sort of morning Middlesex had today to swing this tight London derby back in their favour.

By: Bloomberg | Published: May 20, 2017 3:01 PM Here is Google’s vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, “Ok, Google,” triggering the company’s Assistant. (Reuters) Here is Google’s vision for the future of computing: As you drive home from work, you tell your car, “Ok, Google,” triggering the company’s Assistant. You order food, the digital helper handles the transaction and makes sure it’s ready when you arrive. Right now, Amazon.com Inc. and its Alexa digital assistant are closer to realizing that goal, having cut a deal this year with Ford Motor Co. to let drivers search, shop and control other devices by voice from their vehicles. That’s just one of the ways Amazon is outpacing Google in the race to weave a digital assistant into consumers’ lives. What’s more, Amazon has a leading e-commerce business well suited to this emerging world, with a massive delivery network to speed orders to shoppers — an area where Google has struggled. Amazon’s Echo connected speakers, launched in 2014, have given Alexa an early lead by reaching millions of users at home, while Google’s rival Home device only came out late last year. “Amazon kind of fell into this lead in 2014 because it wanted to sell more things to people in new ways,” said Brian Roemmele, founder of ReadMultiplex.com, a website about voice-based commerce and computing. “Google is trying to evolve its online search experience into devices that have a voice. That philosophy limits its ability to really go after Amazon.” Central to Alexa’s appeal: Amazon has thousands of voice-based apps up and running, far out-numbering Google’s tally. The Alphabet Inc. unit used its I/O developer conference this week to try to narrow Amazon’s lead by wooing skilled programmers capable of building tools and services that can make the Google Assistant more useful. The company stressed experience with mobile software and the millions of things it already understands on the web and in the real world. Vehicle and payment functions were rolled out to expand the Assistant beyond the more simple ways people use it now, such as setting alarms and playing music. “A lot of what you need to get done is transactional,” said Gummi Hafsteinsson, product director for the Assistant. “We take care of all the nitty-gritty hard parts.” Technology giants think voice-based computing could be the next big platform, after mobile. The company that wins will have the most users talking to devices and the most developers creating new experiences. Google’s Assistant has only been active for six months. That’s a major disadvantage when it comes to creating that virtuous circle of users and developers. It tried to get that circle spinning faster at I/O. About 7,000 conference attendees were offered a free Google Home speaker and $700 worth of credits for its cloud-computing service. The company is hoping these developers will use both to build and test new voice-based apps (known as Actions on Google) for the company’s Assistant. It needs to fire up these developers, many of whom have already been building for Amazon’s Alexa system. By February, there were 10,000 Alexa Skills — the equivalent of an app for Amazon’s voice-based system — up from 1,000 in June 2016. Bloomberg News counted fewer than 300 Actions for Google’s Assistant built by outside developers on Friday afternoon. Last June, the voice-based technology wasn’t available publicly yet. Neither company is anywhere close to the dream of a naturally conversant machine. But Google is leaning on its expertise in artificial intelligence fields like voice recognition and automated language understanding to push it ahead if or when this form of human-computer interaction takes off. It also hopes long experience collecting and organizing information from the web will provide a useful fallback solution when the company’s Assistant lacks a specific Action to address user questions. Take cooking recipes, an early use for hands-free speakers. By November, Alexa could talk budding home chefs through more than 60,000 recipes. That came from a Skills integration with the cooking app Allrecipes. The latest Echo Look device, with a screen, is particularly well suited to voice-based kitchen use because it can show people recipes, as well as tell them about ingredients and cooking steps. Bloomberg News asked Google’s Assistant to talk to Allrecipes on Friday afternoon, and the digital helper sent web links rather than an integrated voice-based Action. However, the Assistant has access to 45,000 recipe websites that have already been marked up with special code that lets Google’s software read out ingredients and other related information, Hafsteinsson said. “Google has better understanding. It has been working on AI much longer,”said Patricia Carando, a mobile developer attending the I/O conference. She’s been working on an Alexa Skill, but she was learning how to create an Action for Google’s Assistant during coding classes at the event on Thursday. Eventually, consumers will pick one digital assistant “and stick with it,” pushing developers to mostly build on that platform, she added. A deep concern for Google is that more people will stick with Amazon or a potential device from other competitors like Apple Inc. You May Also Like To Watch This: That’s behind Google’s rush to integrate its Assistant with any and all connected devices. At I/O, Google executives unveiled Home Graph, a system for connecting and controlling smart home devices by speaking to the Assistant. There are about 70 outside companies working with Google to sync things like dishwashers, fridges and light bulbs to the voice-based platform, including GE Appliances, Osram Lighting and Leviton, the internet giant said. Even so, Amazon is making the most of its earlier start. The day before I/O began, a new Amazon program emerged for outside developers working with the company’s Alexa digital assistant, which controls its Echo devices and a rising number of other gadgets. If users talk a lot to a developer’s Alexa Skill, then Amazon will send a reward of cold hard cash, according to note posted Amazon’s Alexa developer website. On Amazon’s website, there are hundreds of home devices already for sale that work with Alexa, made by roughly 30 companies such as Samsung Electronics Co., Philips and Wink. Google is taking pains to show how easy it is to use its tools. During an I/O demo in front of a packed crowd of developers on Thursday, a Google engineer built a simple Action for the Assistant that turned on a set of virtual light bulbs, then turned them green, by voice. The company is working on “What it means to be a washing machine,” the engineer said, to giggles from some in the audience. Google is also working on what it means to be an assistant. Organizing web information and supporting apps is familiar terrain. Discerning what consumers want to hear from their voice-based devices is new territory. At an another panel during the week, Google engineers showed developers a list of criteria the company uses to decide what Actions and other data to surface within its new Assistant world. Those included questions about whether end users had to repeat requests, learned something or “LOL” (laughed out loud). The company rarely exposes such specific guidelines. It’s famously secretive about these types of criteria when it comes to search results, to avoid website developers gaming the system and ruining the experience. The fact that it’s being so open, shows how eager it is to lure a new army of outside voice-based developers. “Please, please think about those things,” Valerie Nygaard, a Google product manager, told the audience. “These are the questions we ask ourselves.” No Comments.

It is indeed a great achievement when you consider the number of apps providing almost similar services these days. Of course, one has to take into account the fact that the name Google always rings a bell; but the fact that not every app from the Mountain View California-based company has been that successful. Anil Sabharwal, Vice President Google Photos said: “Two years ago we introduced Google Photos and now, more than 500 million people use it every month, backing up more than 1.2 billion photos and videos per day. Today, we’re announcing three new ways to help you share and receive the meaningful moments in your life.” Along with announcing to the world that it now has 500 million users, Google also introduced three new features to make sharing and printing on the app easier and interesting. Everyone, and that includes you, will soon be able to order printed books of photos when using the app. You will also be able to share all photos automatically with a significant order, get automated suggestions about what to share based on clues. Suggested Sharing: Suggested Sharing, as Google calls its new feature, will help you share and receive all those important photos—and yes, it saves you the stress of having to manually do it by yourself. This feature is based on Google’s machine learning technology—and will remind you to share, and automatically select the right photos, suggest who to send it to according to who is in the photos. Suggested Sharing is easy to use, simply tap the send button, and your friends and family will see all your photos. They will also get a reminder from the app to share their photos too. “Now all the photos of that birthday dinner or weekend trip are in one place, including—and especially—the photos you didn’t take,” said Sabharwal. The new Suggested Sharing feature can be located in the app’s new Sharing tab, which will be rolling out on Android, iOS and web in the next couple of weeks. Shared Libraries: Shared Libraries is a new addition to Google Photos that allows you to automatically send and receive photos with one other person. Sharing photos with someone means you have to grant access to your full photo library to the individual. However, you can place a restriction on the kind of pictures you want the person to have access to. Credit: https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-500-million-new-sharing/ Photo Books: It’s now easier to print out your favorite photos with a new feature called Photo Books. Simply select the photos that interest you, and Google Photos will find the best shots for you. This will be done by getting rid of duplicates and images that are of low quality. On your part, you will be responsible for making some minor tweaks and place your order. Credit: https://blog.google/products/photos/google-photos-500-million-new-sharing/ Unlike the other two features [Suggested Sharing and Shared Libraries], Photos Books is only rolling out to users in the US, and has a starting price of $9.99 for a 20-page softcover book and $19.99 for a hardcover book.

Google this week gave us a clearer steer on the type of AR functionality we can expect from its own platform, and it’s likely that we will see some similar features in the iPhone 8 … NordVPN Google’s I/O conference had two AR-focused announcements. First, Tango now gets a new Visual Positioning Service (VPS) that effectively acts as a highly accurate form of indoor GPS. Apple has of course been working on its own approach to indoor GPS since 2013, using a combination of the M7 dedicated motion coprocessor in the iPhone and iBeacons. VPS takes a different approach, using a 3D camera system to build a detailed three-dimensional visual map of an indoor space. Second, Google revealed that the first smartphone with support for both Tango and Daydream capabilities will be launched in the summer: the ASUS ZenFone AR. If you want to predict the type of applications you’re likely to see from any new technology, ‘follow the money’ is always a safe bet – so it’s no surprise that shopping is a key focus of the ZenFone. CNET reports that hardware chain Lowes is already on board with VPS, offering an app that allows you to put together a shopping list and then be guided around the store to where you’ll find the items. Once your shopping is complete, it can guide you to the first available checkout. But AR can do much more that this. For example, shopping for furniture? The ZenFone allows you to create a 3D map of your home, as seen in the top image. Then when you go to the furniture store, you’ll be able to take 3D images of, say, a sofa, and see exactly what it would look like in your living room. Similarly with clothes. The Gap already allows you to project any item of clothing onto a virtual mannequin, to get a better sense of what it looks like when being worn. An obvious next step would be to create 3D images of your own body so that you can see what it looks like on you, without the hassle of trying it on. Another safe bet with any new tech is gaming applications. Virtual reality is of course heavily focused on games, but as we’ve seen with Pokémon Go, augmented reality can also be used for gaming. The blurring of the line between VR and AR is likely to be particularly acute with gaming. For example, the upcoming Sims Freeplay has support for VR. Not only can you tilt your phone to see the scenes from any angle, but you can zoom right in to virtually walk around the rooms of your simulated world. Take that idea one step further and you could perhaps interact with your Sims characters in your own living room. But AR can also be used for more worthy ideas. For example, how much more engaged would kids be in learning about the solar system if you could use AR to bring planets right into the classroom and allow them to walk around them, or explore them with a selfie stick? That’s an application available right now on the ZenFone AR. We’ve also seen more specialist applications of AR in fields like surgery and can doubtless expect more from hardware more geared to handling it. Apple will of course have its own specific plans for AR, but these general areas – AR mapping, shopping, gaming and education – seem likely bets. What type of AR applications most excite you? What are the ideas we haven’t mentioned that you think have potential? As always, please share your thoughts and ideas in the comments.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai introduced the venture during Google’s developer conference, which wrapped up on Friday. "All of Google was built because we started understanding text and web pages. So the fact that computers can understand images and videos has profound implications for our core mission," he said while speaking about Lens. The technology basically turns the camera from a passive tool that’s capturing the world around you to one that’s allowing you to interact with what’s in your camera’s viewfinder. A few of the features of the Lens include:  1) Telling species of a flower by viewing the flowers through camera lens 2) Read a WiFi password through the camera  3) Offering information pertaining to restaurants by viewing them through the camera The feature is being added to Google Photos and personalised artificial intelligence software assistant. The technology will also help with translation purposes.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

When Dustin Martin had that attempted long shot late in the game, Jeremy Cameron smothered it. But he’d managed to stooge the umpire and get several metres over the mark, by coming up to replace the man who was on the mark originally. Tom Scully crept back up near the line of the mark as well, and with the umpire’s eyes on him perhaps, Cameron came in from the side and smothered the ball almost as Martin kicked it. Even if the kick hadn’t been a goal, the umpire should have given 50 metres for breaching the mark. And that would have taken Martin to the goal line. Hmmmm indeed. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.20am EDT 08:20 I stopped talking about the Brisbane-Adelaide game in the end to spare us all the embarrassment. Cameron kicked four, Greenwood kicked three - a couple of young kids. They didn’t even need their stars. Well, ok, Betts and Walker and Lynch all kicked three as well. But you get what I mean. Not much for Brisbane, a couple each for Barrett and Zorko. It was 60-140 in the end. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.14am EDT 08:14 How quickly things change. Exhaustion kicks in during the last couple of minutes: the Fever give up a couple of fouls, a couple of missed passes, and the (netball) Magpies kick out to a seven-goal win, 42-49 over in the west. It’s a double Magpie night. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.07am EDT 08:07 It’s 42-44 in the netball, the Fever won’t give up. They’ve trailed most of the game, they were level for a brief moment, then it went back to five goals, now they’re back to two against the Magpies. Four minutes left. Updated at 8.08am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.06am EDT 08:06 Collingwood (12.12.90) beat Hawthorn (11.6.72) Well, Buckley could have had “Embattled” added by deed poll before “Nathan” this season. But he crafts his first win over Hawthorn in a substantial career, and a massive comeback is sealed. It was 43 points in favour of Hawthorn midway through the second quarter, and still 40 near the end of it. But Collingwood dragged back a couple of goals just before half time, then five unanswered in the third term. Breust got the first in the last, but it was to be Hawthorn’s only goal for the half, as the Magpies eventually scrambled four more, most of them late in the term. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 8.01am EDT 08:01 Pies win it, and Hodge loses it. A tight contest in Collingwood’s forward pocket. Taylor Adams gave Hodge a whack, Hodge charged back into the pick and drove him into the ground. Pendlebury pulled Hodge up, and Hodge gave him a left jab to the jaw. Will miss a week or two there. In the meantime, the ball was knocked clear, Josh Smith ran onto it, and snapped the winner. It’s 90 plays 72 with a minute and a half left. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.55am EDT 07:55 Ooof, should have been a 50-metre penalty there. Free kick to Hawthorn at half-forward, Goldsack kicked the ball well over the player’s head. The umpire is kind, says that it was close enough to the player. It is a tough rule - a simple skill error and a player could concede a key goal. Instead the forward entry is repelled by Collingwood. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.53am EDT 07:53 Collingwood out to 13 points. The ball loose inside 50, Sidebottom snaps from the pocket and sedns through a magnificent one. Alistair Clarkson is looking grim in the coach’s box. It’s 84-71 to the Pies now, after haing been 43 points down in the first half. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.50am EDT 07:50 Pendlebury again at the MCG. What a couple of minutes. And he was just strolling there. Roved a pack at the 50, had so much time that he just jogged a little wider to 40, took his time, sized up the goals and sailed it. 78-71 Collingwood. In Perth, the Fever miss a chance to take the lead, and the Magpies in that game get a couple of quick ones. 33-35 to them. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 7.48am EDT 07:48 Scores level in the netball as well. The Fever goal to make it 32-32.

A ball to the teeth of goal is punched down its throat for a rushed behind. Ball comes out again, turns around, goes back. Clears a contest on the bounce and Pendlebury is waiting out the back. Slips a sideways handball to Elliott, who loves a snap under pressure. Gets it. It’s 72-71 to Collingwood over Hawthorn with 10 minutes left in the last quarter.

Wells again running out to meet the ball on the half volley on the 50. Handballs out to Elliott, who finds Crisp. His set shot gives the ball a ride, and it just clears the goal line from out near the Southern Stand boundary to tie things up. Wellity wellity well.

Darcy Moore runs into an open goal after a sensational bit of play and narrows the deficit to six. Daniel Wells in the middle had a long ball out of defence land in front of him. He punched it about 40 metres forward with a mighty swipe, and with most of Hawthorn’s players down the other end, Moore ran hardest to finish off the counterattack.

Some brilliant runs, some incisions. For a second it looks like they’re through. Then the Raiders apply some brutal team defence, smashing the ball loose and winning a scrum. They’re just running the clock down, picking and driving straight into tackles to whittle off the last seconds, and that is it. Couple of losses in a row for the Eels.

Losses by three points tot he Giants this week two points to Fremantle, last week, and five points to the Dogs the week before.

It’s 6-38 in favour of the visitors over in Perth, with the Force mired in fourth spot in the Australian conference. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.46am EDT 06:46 Speaking of the west, I’ve been neglecting the Western Force. Sadly, they’ve been neglecting themselves as well. They’re 24-6 behind the Highlanders as some dense and unusual rain comes down in Perth at the start of the second half, and they’ve just lost the ball after having won a scrum feed near their try-line. Not much going right for them tonight. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.44am EDT 06:44 Sunhine Coast Lightning (63) beat NSW Swifts (49) A fumble for the Swifts at the end, a full-court pass for Caitlin Bassett, and she’s robbed by the buzzer of her 50th goal. So she has tied the Lightning score single-handedly. Mind you, Sam Wallace got... 39? 40? of those Swifts goals. A margin reflective of the dominance, really, the Lightning were too good throughout. The Fever and the Magpies is the next Super Netball game tonight, coming over from the west.

The clock is back on. But it doesn’t do the job, as the Lightning score first before Wallace nails another Swifts long-ranger.

Parra score twice in the last six minutes, first Manu Ma’u capitalising on a Raiders error near the line for his first try of the season, grabbing a loose ball, before some brilliant dancing from Semi freed up Jennings to go over. They convert the second try, and it’s 10-all at the half. rugbyleaguehub.com (@leaguehubcom) #NRLparcan Semi to Jennings!

Jake Barrett closes the gap to two points, and some ferocious tackling then gives Brisbane the chance to hit the front, but they muff it. The ball streams down the other end, and basketballer Hugh Greenwood runs off the back of a pack to crumb his first goal on debut. There’s a theme tonight, and this one won’t be taken back by the umpire. From the centre bounce, Jacobs gets a great tap for the Crows, there’s a kick to 50, and Greenwood does exactly the same thing to rove that pack, runs inside 50 and slots another from 40 out! That’s how quick the punishment can be against good teams. It’s suddenly 47-33 in favour of the Crows. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.16am EDT 06:16 Swifts get a penalty and convert it, but mess up the follow-up. Then another forward attempt. Three times this quarter they’ve given Wallace far too much to do up forward, trying to lob the ball over her opponents or pass when she’s outnumbered. Even at 193cm, there’s only so much she can do. The Lightning keep scoring on the counter, and their buffer remains roughly where it has been since before half time, at nine goals. It’s 46-37 as they call another time-out. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.10am EDT 06:10 Finally a goal for the Magpies (that’s AFL, not netball), with Brayden Maynard gets their first, but Luke Breust answers immediately with Hawthorn’s seventh. It’s 44 plays 7 at the MCG. Looks pretty full but not completely packed. Adelaide goes past Brisbane, normal service resumed, then Eddie Betts dribbles a miracle goal from the pocket, normal service also resumed. Eddie’s miracles are other people’s multigrain toast. It’s 34-24 to the Crows in that game, second quarter. Updated at 6.17am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 6.07am EDT 06:07 Somerville bombs a long goal, Wallace nearly does the splits to take another ball that she then converts.

Uber issued a warning letter to Anthony Levandowski, saying it would take "adverse employment action against" him if he fails to comply the court's orders, TechCrunch reported on Saturday. This came after Waymo argued that discovery in the case has been held up by Levandowski refusing to answer questions related to the alleged theft of proprietary data. "Levandowski has repeatedly invoked the Fifth Amendment in the case, citing the potential for criminal action that could lead to self-incrimination," the report said. Last week, a judge ordered that Uber "exercise the full extent of (its) corporate, employment, contractual and other authority" to force Levandowski to return any downloaded materials to Waymo. Following that, Uber sent a letter to Levandowski giving him a choice between "deny(ing) ever having taken any downloaded materials from Google" or hand over any materials he might have taken from Google. If he failed to comply, he would risk termination of his employment. Google's self-driving car company Waymo in February filed a lawsuit against Uber for allegedly stealing trade secrets and technology from it. The lawsuit, filed against Uber's self-driving vehicle unit Otto, argued that former Waymo manager Levandowski took information when he left the company and later co-founded Otto in January 2016. "We uncovered evidence that Otto and Uber have taken and are using key parts of Waymo's self-driving technology. Today, we're taking legal action against Otto and its parent company Uber for misappropriating Waymo trade secrets and infringing our patents," Waymo wrote in a blog post. The company said it found that six weeks before his resignation, Levandowski downloaded over 14,000 highly confidential and proprietary design files for Waymo's various hardware systems, including designs of Waymo's custom-built "Light Detection and Ranging" (LiDAR) and circuit board. "To gain access to Waymo's design server, Levandowski searched for and installed specialised software onto his company-issued laptop. Once inside, he downloaded 9.7GB of Waymo's highly confidential files and trade secrets, including blueprints, design files and testing documentation," the company noted. Levandowski copied the data to an external drive. He later wiped and reformatted the laptop in an attempt to erase forensic fingerprints. --IANS sku/na/mr SEARCH More from Sify: talking point on sify news Latest Features Family, friends rejoice ICJ's stay on Kulbhushan Jadhav's execution In Pictures: Modi In Lanka Soldiers vs Stone Pelters Pakistan's betrayal hurts 56" Pakistan's BAT!

The new app, which supports glide typing, lets users search straight from the keyboard, using normal Google search. Once the information is found, user can send it into their application without leaving the keyboard, technewsworld.com reported. No matter what application a user is using, SMS, email, WhatsApp or messenger, the Google logo is always present in the keyboard. “It’s like having a google search in any app, right from the keyboard . . . so we called it a Gboard,” said Google in a video posted in its YouTube account. “Solutions like Google’s Gboard and glide typing are designed to simplify and speed up common tasks. That can be a real boon when you’re under time pressure or are trying to create a complex message on a keyboard of limited size,” Principal Analyst at Pund-IT Charles King was quoted as saying in the same report. Emojis can be searched easily in the search bar. Typing words like “angry,” “pizza,” “cat,” and “car,” user can see all the relevant emoji characters in an instant. In addition, the application can be customized depending to the user’s liking. The user has the option to unable the glide typing, toggle things like auto-correction, auto-capitalization, enable caps lock, among others. Right now, Gboard app is only available in the United States and company has yet to announce when it will be available to download elsewhere.

AP Google’s latest tech tricks grow even smarter May 20, 2017 (…) THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Anil Sabharwal, a Google vice president, demonstrates updates to Google Photos during the keynote address of the Google I/O conference. MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) — Google’s computer programs are gaining a better understanding of the world, and now it wants them to handle more of the decision-making for the billions of people who use its services. CEO Sundar Pichai and other top executives brought Google’s audacious ambition into sharper focus this week at an annual conference attended by more than 7,000 developers who design apps to work with its wide array of digital services. Among other things, Google unveiled new ways for its massive network of computers to identify images, as well as recommend, share, and organize photos. It also is launching an attempt to make its voice-controlled digital assistant more proactive and visual while expanding its audience to Apple’s iPhone, where it will try to outwit an older peer, Siri. The push marks another step toward infusing nearly all of Google’s products with some semblance of artificial intelligence — the concept of writing software that enables computers to gradually learn to think more like humans. Google punctuated the theme near the end of the conference’s keynote address by projecting the phrase, “Computing that works like we do.” Pichai has made AI the foundation of his strategy since becoming Google’s CEO in late 2015, emphasizing that technology is rapidly evolving from a “mobile-first” world, where smartphones steer the services that companies are building, to an “AI-first” world, where the computers supplement the users’ brains. AI unnerves many people because it conjures images of computers eventually becoming smarter than humans and eventually running the world. That may sound like science fiction, but the threat is real enough to prompt warnings from respected technology leaders and scientists, including Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk and Stephen Hawking. But Pichai and Google co-founder Larry Page, now CEO of Google corporate parent Alphabet Inc., see it differently. They believe computers can take over more of the tedious, grunt work so humans have more time to think about deeper things and enjoy their lives with friends and family. Other big tech companies, including Amazon.com, Microsoft, Apple and Facebook, also are making AI a top priority as they work on similar services to help users stay informed and manage their lives. Google believes it can lead the way in AI largely because it has built a gigantic network of data centers with billions of computers scattered around the world. This while people using its dominant internet search engine and leading email service have been feeding the machines valuable pieces of personal information for nearly 20 years. Now, Google is drawing upon that treasure trove to teach new tricks to its digital assistant, which debuted last year on its Pixel phone and an internet-connected speaker called Home that is trying to mount a challenge to Amazon’s Echo. Google Assistant is on more than 100 million devices after being on the market for slightly more than six months and now is trying to invade new territory with a free app released this week that works on the operating system powering Apple’s iPhone. Previously, the assistant worked only on Google’s Android software. Google’s assistant will be at a disadvantage on the iPhone, though, because Siri — a concierge that Apple introduced in 2011 — is built into that device. A new service called Google Lens will give Assistant a new power. Lens uses AI to identify images viewed through a phone. For instance, point the phone at a flower and Assistant will call upon Lens to identify the type of flower. Or point the camera at the exterior of a restaurant and it will pull up reviews of the place. Pinterest has a similar tool. Also called Lens, it lets people point their cameras at real-world items and find out where to buy them, or find similar things online. Google Photos is adding a new tool that will prompt you to share photos you take of people you know. For instance, Photos will notice when you take a shot of a friend and nudge you to send it to her, so you don’t forget. Google will also let you share whole photo libraries with others. Facebook has its own version of this feature in its Moments app. One potentially unsettling new feature in Photos will let you automatically share some or all of your photos with other people. Google maintains the feature will be smart enough so that you would auto-share only specific photos — say, of your kids — to your partner or a friend. Google is also adding a feature to Photos to create soft-cover and hard-cover albums of pictures at prices beginning at $9.99. The app will draw upon its AI powers to automatically pick out the best pictures to put in the album. New Google features Some of Google’s new bells and whistles are already offered by rivals such as Amazon, Apple and Facebook. ECHOING THE ECHO Google added features to its internet-connected Home speaker — such as hands-free calling. That echoes Amazon’s Echo speaker, which was released earlier. The new abilities will also enable the Home speaker to control and interact with a variety of Whirlpool and Jenn-Air appliances later this year. For instance, you can ask the digital assistant within Home to turn on the dishwasher or set the temperature on the oven. This is already available on the Echo and other devices that use its Alexa assistant. YOUR SEEING EYE Google’s new Lens tool is the stuff of science fiction. It lets people point their camera at things to find out more information about them. So if you see a flower, you can point your camera at it to find out its name. Samsung is trying some of that with its new Bixby Vision feature on the Galaxy S8 phones. Pinterest has a similar tool too. SLIMMING DOWN Though not a competitor, Google’s slimmed-down phone operating system aimed at cheap Android phones is reminiscent of Facebook’s own “skinny” version, called Facebook Lite. Both are aimed at getting more people to use the company’s services, even if they luse cheap, older phones. MEETING SIRI ON HER TURF Google’s digital assistant is hoping to outsmart Siri on Apple’s iPhone. Google is releasing its voice-controlled assistant on a free app designed for iPhone’s operating system — basically competing with Apple’s assistant on her own turf. The move extends the potential reach of Google’s assistant, which debuted last fall on the company’s Pixel phone and an internet-connected speaker called Home. Siri has come as a built-in service on iPhones since 2011; Google’s assistant will require an app download. © 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The AI assistant will be rolling out to all smartphones running Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 6.0 Marshmallow eventually but will also be available on some newly announced partner devices like the fabulous new LG G6 (our hands-on preview). What is Google Assistant and why would you want it in the first place? Google Assistant is an intelligent personal AI that was recently only available on Google proper devices like Pixel and Pixel XL phones, Google Home, Google Allo, and Android Wear. The system was similar to Google Now in that it could check the weather, work alongside smart home devices, offer information and directions, and answer questions from search results and offer info about a user’s schedule. The biggest difference between the two assistants is that Google Assistant is able to engage in two-way conversations with the users, without the need to keep barking "OK Google" at the AI.  According to Google Assistant Project Lead Gummi Hafsteinsson, “Whether you need to know how to say “nice to meet you” in Korean or just a simple reminder to do laundry when you get home, your Assistant can help. With the Google Assistant on Android phones, you have your own personal, helpful Google right in your pocket.” Google Assistant will begin rolling out this week to English users in the United States. It will continued to be introduced in English to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom and then in the German language as well. Additional languages and countries will be added throughout the year. Google Assistant was recently added to Android Wear 2.0 through new smartwatch introductions and is supposed to soon also be introduced to smart TVs and vehicles. According to Google, their “goal is to make the Assistant available anywhere you need it”. Google Assistant can also be seen at the Android Global Village at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain this week. Attendants can demo Google Assistant across a variety of Android devices such as phones from HTC, Huawei, Samsung, LG and Sony.

Alle Posts des Autors Email: In diesem Artikel geben wir Ihnen eine Schritt-für-Schritt-Anleitung an die Hand, mit der Sie den Google-Chrome-Browser auf Ihrem Android-Smartphone einrichten und die Basisfunktionen nutzen können. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Google Chrome hat viele Funktionen in Petto, die kaum einer kennt. Schritt 1: Installation und Einrichtung Nach der Installation müssen Sie den Nutzungsbedingungen und Datenschutzhinweisen zustimmen. Foto: IDG Um die Google-Chrome-App auf Ihrem Smartphone zu nutzen, müssen Sie diese, falls nicht vorinstalliert, zuerst auf Ihrem Androiden einrichten. Öffnen Sie hierfür die Google-Play-Store-Anwendung auf Ihrem Mobilgerät, und tippen Sie in die Suchleiste "Google Chrome" ein. Berühren Sie nun die Schaltfläche "Installieren", und warten Sie, bis der Vorgang abgeschlossen ist. Öffnen Sie die Applikation anschließend zum ersten Mal, und akzeptieren Sie die Nutzungsbedingungen und Datenschutzhinweise. Um Ihre Lesezeichen, Ihren Browserverlauf, Ihre Passwörter und alle Einstellungen auf allen Geräten synchron zu halten, müssen Sie Google Chrome im nächsten Schritt mit Ihrem Google-Mailkonto verbinden. Schließen Sie dann die Einrichtung der App ab. In der Eingabeleiste können Sie anschließend nach einem bestimmten Begriff suchen oder die URL einer Internetseite eingeben, die Sie besuchen wollen. Schritt 2: Tabs verwalten Öffnen Sie ein neues Browserfenster, indem Sie das App-Menü öffnen und auf den Punkt „Neuer Tab“ tippen. Foto: IDG Um in der Chrome-App ein neues Fenster, einen sogenannten Tab, zu öffnen, tippen Sie oben rechts auf die drei Punkte, um das Applikationsmenü zu öffnen. Wählen Sie hier die Option "Neuer Tab". Wenn Sie den Chrome-Browser schon etwas länger verwenden, listet er Ihnen im neu geöffneten Fenster unter der Eingabeleiste eine Reihe Ihrer meistbesuchten Internetseiten auf. Um eine davon zu besuchen, genügt eine kurze Berührung des jeweiligen Symbols. Wenn Sie eine Seite aus der Auflistung entfernen wollen, müssen Sie diese antippen und länger gedrückt halten. Im sich öffnenden Klappmenü finden Sie anschließend die Option "Entfernen". Beenden Sie alle Browserfenster auf einmal, indem Sie in der Tabverwaltung auf die drei Punkte tippen und den Punkt „Alle Tabs schließen“ wählen. Foto: IDG Das kleine Quadrat neben dem Anwendungsmenü gibt Auskunft darüber, wie viele Tabs Sie insgesamt aktuell nutzen. Wenn Sie es berühren, zeigt Google Chrome Ihnen untereinander angeordnet alle genutzten Tabs übersichtlich aufgelistet an. Hier können Sie ganz einfach zwischen den einzelnen Tabs hin und her wechseln. Schließen lassen sich die Fenster entweder über das X am rechten oberen Tabrand oder indem Sie es mit einer Wischgeste nach Links aus dem Bildschirm schieben. Es ist außerdem möglich, alle geöffneten Tabs gleichzeitig zu beenden. Berühren Sie hierfür oben rechts die drei Punkte, und entscheiden Sie sich dann für "Alle Tabs schließen". Um die Inhalte aller geöffneten Fenster zu aktualisieren, öffnen Sie auch hier das App-Menü über die drei Punkte und tippen auf den kreisförmigen Pfeil oben der Symbolleiste. Schritt 3: Lesezeichen hinzufügen und verwalten Über Ihre Lesezeichenliste finden Sie interessante Webseiten schnell wieder oder können mit nur einem Tipp Ihre Lieblingsseite besuchen. Foto: IDG In der Google-Chrome-App haben Sie die Möglichkeit, interessante oder oft besuchte Webseiten mit einem sogenannten Lesezeichen zu versehen. Den Weg, um ein neues Lesezeichnen für eine geöffnete Seite hinzuzufügen, finden Sie über die drei Punkte im App-Menü. Tippen Sie hier auf das kleine Sternchen oben in der Symbolleiste. Sie haben nun erfolgreich ein Lesezeichen für die Seite gesetzt. Um dieses zu bearbeiten, berühren Sie erneut den nun blau eingefärbten Stern. Sie können anschließend den Namen des Lesezeichens bearbeiten. Als Speicherort schlägt Chrome Ihnen automatisch den Ordner "Mobile Lesezeichen" vor. Wenn Sie diesen antippen, lassen sich hier nach Belieben verschiedene Unterordner erstellen. Berühren Sie hierfür einfach jeweils die Option "Neuer Ordner". Alle gespeicherten Lesezeichen finden Sie anschließend im App-Menü unter dem Punkt "Lesezeichen" aufgelistet. Schritt 4: Standortermittlung aktivieren Google Chrome benötigt Ihren Standort, um Ihnen beispielsweise Restaurants in Ihrer unmittelbaren Nähe vorschlagen zu können. Foto: IDG Damit Ihnen der Chrome-Browser so viele nützliche Informationen wie möglich anzeigen kann, müssen Sie ihm dem Zugriff auf Ihre Standortdaten gewähren. Dies ist beispielsweise dann nützlich, wenn Sie nach einem Restaurant oder einer Bar in Ihrer Nähe suchen. Die entsprechende Funktion finden Sie im App-Menü unter "Einstellungen -> Webseite-Einstellungen -> Standort!". Aktivieren Sie hier den Schieberegler. Schritt 5: Datensparmodus aktivieren Sparen Sie beim mobilen Datenverbrauch, indem Sie den Sparmodus im Google-Chrome- Browser aktivieren. Foto: IDG Damit Sie möglichst den ganzen Monat lang mit maximaler Geschwindigkeit surfen können, bietet Google Chrome einen praktischen Datensparmodus. Der Browser leitet dabei die anfallenden Daten über die Google-Server und komprimiert sie. So verringert sich automatisch die Datenmenge, die Sie beim Surfen auf Ihr Smartphone herunterladen. Um den Sparmodus zu aktivieren, öffnen Sie im App-Menü die Einstellungen. Unter "Erweitert" finden Sie den Punkt "Datensparmodus". Aktivieren Sie hier den Schieberegler. Anschließend informiert Sie eine Grafik über die Einsparungen. Beachten Sie aber, dass Sie nicht auf die Sparfunktion zugreifen können, wenn Sie anonym im Inkognitomodus surfen oder Seiten besuchen, deren URL mit https:// anfängt. Außerdem kann es zu Einbußen in der Qualität der dargestellten Bilder kommen. Schritt 6: Anonym surfen Mithilfe des Inkognitomodus können Sie anonym im Internet surfen, ohne dass Ihr Browserverlauf für andere Personen nachvollziehbar ist. Foto: IDG Wenn Sie beim Surfen via Android-Smartphone keine Spuren im Internet hinterlassen wollen, sollten Sie den Inkognitomodus des Chrome-Browsers nutzen. Anonymes Surfen hat nicht nur den Vorteil, dass Ihre Suchanfragen und der Browserverlauf für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar sind, Sie können auch beispielsweise zwei Accounts bei Ihrem E-Mail-Dienst oder einer Social-Media-Plattform gleichzeitig nutzen. Auch wenn Sie auf einem fremden Gerät etwa Ihre Mails checken wollen, bietet sich anonymes Surfen an. Tippen Sie oben rechts in der Suchleiste auf die drei Punkte und anschließend auf die Option "Neuer Inkognito-Tab". Artikel als PDF kaufen Newsletter 'Mobile' bestellen!

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices [Update] Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares191 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not. It appears that Pay has been fixed via a server-side update, which is why some people who have had trouble updating their Nexuses can now use the Pay app.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it. Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory and OTA images are now available to download.

Dirge Not the ugly, ugly dots! No! Trooper311 Have not noticed that myself. Tiuri Elvander They never appeared for me in the first place. Do you know which apps support them?? Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture. Dirge Installed fine on my Pixel; Won't install on my Nexus Player. vwnut13 Does Hulu open on your Nexus Player? Dirge I don't use Hulu so I don't know. Kyle Anyone having scrambled audio when playing videos? Usually within Facebook or streamable videos. Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? Dn Bro No it's oem unlocking option https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e5b64da4b008176fb08c064f9e16566252aa48001e2ccb59231062d5af2a2dd4.png ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Martial Clausse After a day or two, all the crashes seem to have gone away automagically... It was bad, I couldn't read my emails and so on, but now everything works... So I'll keep this as a daily driver :) Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning. The version is the same, but now it's a 1047MB download. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9000c49c9403d0d934b43f20e78a43675548972a522f62b370ca9822f5b69643.png Guilherme Noronha Just installed the 1047MB OTA. It installed successfully and build number went up to .019 OkieDokie Awesome news. My 6P is downloading a much bigger .019 OTA as well, this time it is 1053.3 MB so hopefully this one works like it did for your 5X. satyendra karn It is working now.

Netflix was just the start: Google Play Console lets developers exclude app availability for devices that don't pass SafetyNet Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 3:57am PDTMay 18, 2017 97 Plus 1 on G+ 112 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News Last weekend, a huge turmoil swept the root-enthusiast Android community as it was discovered then confirmed that the Netflix app was being blocked from showing up in search results on the Play Store for rooted devices. At the time, Netflix said it was using Widevine to block unsupported devices, but that made no sense to us: the app was still functional if it was sideloaded, it was only not showing up as compatible in the Play Store. So what sorcery was Netflix really using?! Turns out it's a new function of the Google Play Console. As part of the updates announced for the Play Console at I/O 2017, Google mentions a new Device Catalog section under Release management that lets developers choose with intricate granularity which devices their app supports on the Play Store. Devices can be viewed and excluded by many attributes including RAM and SoC, but the important factor we're interested in is SafetyNet Attestation. New "Device catalog" lets devs manage the exclusions. Developers will be able to choose from 3 states shown in the top image: not excluding devices based on SafetyNet, excluding those that don't pass integrity, or excluding the latter plus those that aren't certified by Google. That means any dev could potentially block their apps from showing and being directly installable in the Play Store on devices that are rooted and/or running a custom ROM, as well as on emulators and uncertified devices (think Meizu and its not-so-legal way of getting Play Services and the Play Store on its phones). This is exactly what many of you were afraid would happen after the Play Store app started surfacing a Device certification status. This is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation that apps like Android Pay and Pokémon Go use. In the case of Pay/Go, the attestation check happens when the app is installed on your phone and doesn't allow it to run unless it passes the integrity test. But in the case of the Play Console, the attestation check happens when you're browsing the Play Store and only affects the availability of the app for your device. If the full SafetyNet API isn't included in the app itself, you will still be able to grab the APK from other sources, install it, and the app will work just fine. Still, this spells trouble for rooted users and the Android enthusiast community as a whole. Google keeps erecting more and more obstacles each day in the face of root and custom ROMs and even if this won't stop root users who should be knowledgable enough to know how/where to grab an APK and install it, it will make things more and more difficult and maybe less and less worth the trouble. But y'all are rebels and you'll keep on finding a way around it, won't you?

Nice move Google. Suicide_Note Not sure if serious, but either way, this was just a matter of time. YouNex Obviously not serious EowynCarter So, question : Is there anyway to get android O in the future on my nexus 6 and not having problems with this ? IF manufacturer where taking care of updating their devices, wouldn't be an issue... saf1927 If Magisk keeps working, yep. You can. Even my old Nexus 5 is on 7.1.2 and it passes SafetyNet. EowynCarter I want "just work" stuff. Not workaround. Maybe Magisk does the job for some, but not an acceptable solution from my point of view. Mainly the "we don't know if it will keep on working" part. saf1927 Well, it's the best solution so far and it has improved a lot since its inception. I never bothered since the Nexus 5 was a secondary device for me, but now that some apps won't show up anymore on the Play Store, I simply flashed Magisk and that's about it. I haven't tweaked anything. Plus, if you are already flashing a custom ROM, flashing an extra zip file isn't that much work anyway. EowynCarter True, but it's the phone I use dailly. I don't want apps sudendly not working, becasue google decided to push an update that broke magisk. mxwp well if you want things to "just work" then i guess get an iPhone EowynCarter Sadly, I'm beginning to think about that. But that would cause others frustrations. ED-Zが現れた! Well, people will just flock to root-supported apps... Milton P. I actually forgot when was the last time I Rooted a device. No biggie. Suicide_Note The bad thing is it isn't just root that causes problems. Simply unlocking the bootloader will produce the same result. Maxr1998 Just because it's no biggie for you, it doesn't mean everyone approves this. I am actually pretty concerned, because this limits the freedom over our devices even more.. Milton P. Define freedom, please. Maxr1998 Software freedom, to be more specific. You should have the freedom to use and modify your device and it's software however you'd like, and have fill control over it. That means, root access. And since the AOSP core IS free software, the 4 freedoms defined by Richard Stallman apply to it. What this change now introduces is that you're forced to decide between either giving up the freedom over your device or not using the app you wanted to download (which will probably have to be my choice, and that sucks). Milton P. But you're not giving up anything, you just have to make a choice. If you put that way, Google has the freedom of doing with the AOSP core whatever they want, the same way you can modify said core and do as you please, the difference is Google has more money and more responsibilities when it comes to their user base. XDA and other sites will still have a bunch of developers making whatever they please (within the AOSP terms) with the AOSP core. This will just change thinks for the people that use those ROMs bit realistically the vast majority of users won't feel the changes. Sad but true. h4rr4r That choice is giving up freedom you had before. The vast majority will see the rate of Android improvements slow as the Devs on XDA and the like lose interest. Android only exists because of Linux, now it is turning its back on that whole culture. Milton P. Well, I don't see your freedom compromised to be honest with you, but we're seeing things from different angles so that's that. Sorry for your loss in that case. h4rr4r You do not think losing control of your device is a loss of freedom? Milton P. Nope, is just a device, I have more important stuff going on, m device is a tool the same way a hammer is a tool, you can buy a hammer and use it as it is. Sometimes my device is a toy, if I buy a remote control car I'll modify it as long as it is possible, the same way I modify my phone. I have control over my phone. I can install whatever I want at my own risk. If I decide to root my phone I expect things to be broken. I remember when I had an HTC and I hated sense so I decided to install a custom ROM, I gave up the camera and I was aware of it. There was always some compromises with custom ROMs, nothing is changing. I rather have a safe device then a compromised one today, still my choice thou. h4rr4r So you want IOS. Got it. Over here I want freedom. I don't think homedepot should be allowed to tell me what I can hit with the hammer I bought. trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once they become popular. Once the Benjamins come rolling in it tends to override open. h4rr4r Tell that to Linus Torvalds. I am sure he will have many many fuck yous for you. trparky Linux is the rare situation. h4rr4r The rare situation like many others that created android and even google. trparky Yeah but look at Android, the walls are closing around it and there's nothing you can do about it. Face it man, the geeks may have built the system but the common man now rules it. Geeks love choice, yes, they do love their choice but your average person doesn't give a rat's ass about choice. All they want is a device that does what they need it to do when they want to do it. They have no inclination to learn how it works or why it works just as long as it does. This is what geeks do not and refuse to understand. h4rr4r Sure there is, stop using it. Then the common folks will have to follow us to the next platform. trparky As long as their is money involved in maintaining Android it doesn't matter if something better comes along, people will continue supporting Android because it makes them money. Money makes the world go round, get used to it. Maxr1998 ^ What @h4rr4r:disqus says. trparky Yep. The root and ROM community is such a small portion of the Android ecosystem that they really don't matter to them. People have been screaming at Google for years to get the Android house fixed up, this is them doing just that. You can't blame them for doing what the people have asked for. mxwp I agree with you, but sadly you only have freedom over hardware. You can do what you want with the device you buy. But with software you never actually buy it... you only buy a license to use it. Thus you have no real freedom with software. Maxr1998 Android is free software, Apache 2.0 license. At least the AOSP part of it. trparky But the Google parts of it are not covered under the Apache 2.0 license. That's essentially why ROM developers can't package the Google Play Services pack with the ROM itself and instead requires you to download a separate ZIP package from Google to install it separate from the ROM package. Android itself may be free and open but the Google Play Services part is not. Sudev There are far more than few arguments against root access but here are some: Root access is meant for experimental & development purpose and not for Daily Driver for any average user of the platform. Google Play Services & Apps available on Play Store are not "Free Software". Google as provider of Play Services infrastructure has much more liabilities then one can simply assume. And also the app developers have responsibility to protect end users' data. If device has root access available and any rouge app / maleware steals other apps data which is possible, who will be at stack? Maxr1998 1) No, it isn't. Just look at Linux/Windows. There you need root/admin access for installing or updating applications all the time. You type in your password (on Linux) or click grant, done! Same with using e.g. SuperSu on Android, you grant the su request, done. 2) Google doesn't use it to protect YOUR data, they provide it as DRM method for 3rd parties - basically "locking down" your device. 3) Uhmmm.. Nope? If you root your device, apps can't just use the su rights without your permission - except if they use an exploit, which would also work on an unrooted device. And if you yourself give a malware app su rights because you couldn't understand the situation, it's completely your own fault. h4rr4r The ability to do anything I want with my things that I own. Milton P. You​ can do whatever you want with your device, nobody is stopping you. You might see that some apps are not showing up in the play store but you can still side load them, I still see freedom in your future. h4rr4r For how much longer? Soon these apps will ask play services if they are supposed to be installed on that device, at that point you can say goodbye to sideloading. If this is what people want then IOS was the platform for them. thecoolkid Ok Google, define freedom... 😁 Nick I would imagine a great deal of people on this site will be upset, but in actuality I don't think this will affect the user base of many apps that badly h4rr4r Not in the short term. However in the long term it will. Android only exists because of the FREE software movement. Nick Yes, but that doesn't apply to applications, which this is about. h4rr4r Think long term. Same thing applies. trparky No it won't because the root and ROM community is so small it doesn't matter to Google anymore. The 95% of people who simply want a device that works don't care and likely won't ever care. As long as they can play NetFlix, Pokemon Go, or whatever is the next craze they don't care. h4rr4r Again, that is short term thinking. Think past the end of your nose. Android exists because of linux. Google needs this small group to create the very stuff they rely on. trparky You overestimate the value that the community has now. Android may have needed the community back in the beginning to gain the foothold that it has in the market but not so anymore. Android has near 100% market penetration, they have achieved world domination. They don't need the community anymore, they have achieved their goals. h4rr4r Until they are unseated. IBM once had a monopoly on computing devices. They did not need the community to gain a foothold, they would not have a product to gain a foothold without the community. Android only exists because of a collection of those projects. trparky No, Android exists because Samsung, HTC, and LG make devices people want and it makes them money by the semi-truck full. The community doesn't mean shit now, all that matters to these companies is one thing... money, money, and more money. Oh, and did I mention money? This is capitalism man, money rules the world. If you don't make money you are dead. h4rr4r Please tell me how that would have happened without linux. Money loses to good engineering every day. Look at how linux killed solaris. trparky Tell me why Windows is the defacto monopoly on the desktop despite the fact that Linux is better in every damn way possible under the hood? That's right... money. h4rr4r Because the desktop is dead. The fight is over. They lost. Even money can't keep them relevant. trparky Oh, you're funny. The desktop is not dead, it will never be dead. When people need to do real work, they sit down at a desktop. When people want to play real games, they sit down at a desktop. When people need to type out anything longer than a page like a college term paper, they sit down at a desktop. The desktop is king and will always be king. Long live the desktop! h4rr4r The Desktop is a dead man walking. When they do real work, they use a Citrix session. When they game they use a console, or they are already nerds. When people type they can use a fucking chromebook. The desktop as you think of it died already. trparky Try and say that shit over at TechPowerUp, HardOCP, Overclock.net, TomsHardware, etc. and trust me when I say this... you'll be run out of town by people with pitchforks and torches. h4rr4r Those are all nerds. Those are the folks who have desktops running 3 different OSes. They are the folks who are pissed about android being locked down. trparky And your point being? You just admitted that only the "nerds" care about Android being open. Sure, those same "nerds" will go off and create a new platform but the rest of the people who are living in the real world and who don't care one damn bit about how it works will continue to use Android. h4rr4r Those people will eventually move to the new platform. Just like they did with Android. trparky And the same thing will happen to that platform in the future that's happening to Android now. Open platforms are nice and all, I'll admit that, but your average person doesn't care one bit. I dare you to go up to any person on the street and ask them anything about Android. What phone do they have? What model? Most will say "I don't know, something that my carrier gave me for cheap." h4rr4r The wheel of computing we call it. It has happened and will happen again. So what? trparky Which reinforces the idea that I said before, eventually all open systems will become closed (or less open) at some point in their life cycle. It usually happens when it becomes popular with the common man. Why? Because like I've been trying to get through your thick skull, the average person doesn't care how any of this stuff works so long as it works. h4rr4r The average person does not matter. Few open systems become closed. AOSP is still fine. trparky What the hell do you mean by "they don't matter"? They're the ones buying the devices, buying the apps, looking at the ads, etc. Just how the fuck does that translate to "they don't matter"? h4rr4r Because they don't. They don't create, they don't cause new things to be created. They are just users, just like I don't matter to how movies are created. trparky But without money from the people who are consuming said things developers won't make new stuff. Developers do have to eat you know and put a roof over their heads. h4rr4r The giant world of FOSS pretty much proves you wrong. Demand cannot create supply. I don't pirate anything kiddo. I have way too much to lose for that. One of those lawsuits I would actually have to pay, since I could. trparky I'll give a hint on how FOSS works a lot of the time. Some of the top tier Linux kernel developers actually work for companies and they just contribute code in their free time. They may work for Intel, AMD, nVidia, or God knows what but only after their day job is done. Why? Because they need money and they need to eat. This is a basic requirement for people in this world. They need money!!! People don't just write code for the love of it, even Linus Torvalds who's in charge of the Linux kernel itself works for the Linux Foundation and yes, he gets paid for his work to the tune of $10 Million a year. Sorry to burst your bubble man but FOSS projects aren't all happy, happy, joy, joy here... people need to be paid real money to be able to eat, drive a car, put a roof over their heads, etc. On second thought, I'm not sorry I burst your bubble! You need it burst! PEOPLE NEED TO BE PAID REAL FUCKING MONEY!!!! h4rr4r No, they get paid to contribute. During the work day. Not as a hobby. Lots of projects are like that. I won't say exactly how I know about that ;) Their employers just aren't as short sighted as you. Linus did not however create linux to get rich. Great code like great art gets created because it must be. People do what they love. Kid, you will get it one day. When you have enough that you aren't worried about it each day, money stops being that big of a deal. Don't worry everybody goes through a phase like you are now. trparky Dude, we are not the Federation of Planets here living in a happy, happy, joy, joy world in which people can just do whatever they want to do without a care in the world. As long as human greed exists there will always be a need for money. And believe you me, greed will never go away unless we breed a new kind of human and I don't see that happening any time soon. Gene Roddenberry's future will never happen, it just won't. Contrary to a lot of geek dreams it just won't. h4rr4r No idea where you got that idea. Never suggested it. My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. If you make minimum wage doubling your income is a huge deal. Adding the same amount to my income would not get me to take a job I like less. Offering it to Linus would be a waste of time. Yes, some people will keep chasing dollars, they are the exception not the rule. The employers are working on enlightened self interest. Either they use the FOSS product, gain market advantage with direct knowledge, use it for marketing or believe they are getting something else. PostgreSQL for example has a lot of paid contributors who work for companies that either provide customization, consulting or depend on the project. Others just because it increases quality. Commercial software by and large is not high quality. I have seen a lot of it and 90% if you tried to submit it to a FOSS project of any size would get you denied and possibly mocked. This system continues to be more innovative because it is easy to continue to expand. Anyone with a good idea can fork if their idea is not accepted. trparky > My point was the personal relative value of increasing income drops as income goes up. Tell that to the people in Washington or any CEO that demands ever increasing yearly salaries and end of year bonuses all while raping the companies that they work for. Tell that to the psychopaths on Wall Street. For as long as their is money, people will want more of it. Anyone who says that they don't is flat out lying. h4rr4r Those are the exception not the rule. That is why you call them psychopaths. Honestly, correcting for inflation I really don't care that much if I ever make more. Would it be nice sure, would I give up anything I like about my job? No. If you could double my income but it prevented me from contributing to FOSS projects or owning code I generate off the clock, I would not take that deal. If money was enough to make people do anything MS would have offered Linus $11 million a year to not write it. Heck, Sun would have done it while they were still around. trparky Either you're a child that doesn't know how the adult world works or you're a fucking troll. h4rr4r So you have no idea who makes stuff, neat. I guess you think Henry Ford should have made a faster horse. trparky Oh, I know who makes the stuff I use but I also make sure that they are paid! I give money to those developers who write the programs that I enjoy and if I can't pay them I won't use their programs. I only use a program if I can pay for it. I have put money into their tip jars on their web site, I look for PayPal links and I donate even if it's something small like $5. They deserve it! h4rr4r Good for you! There is a lot of great software that does not make money that way. Some even just ask is that you follow the license, like linux which mediatek steals by not releasing kernel source. So I hope you avoid buying that kind of thing. trparky MediaTek controller chips are known to suck so I don't buy them out of that reason alone. h4rr4r Now I have given you another good reason to avoid them. Bunch of thieves. Rita El Khoury I don't even remember when I last bootloader unlocked. But I know this move toward closing the ecosystem further and further will have ripples in the future. The enthusiast community flocked toward Android for its openness and we have custom ROMs and their enterprising devs to thank for HUNDREDS of new features that they implemented first and everyone clamored for and applauded until they became features in AOSP. If Google thinks it can steer this ship alone and it knows best what to do next, we may have less and less interesting features in the future and more and more of what only one entity thinks is best, not a diverse set of opinions. Nick Given that this only gives the developer the option of requiring these checks, it makes me believe that Google had to do this for some companies that have regulatory or other kinds of requirements. Which is a shame for the rooted (and unlocked?) community, but understandable. Shame Google is most likely going to take the blame here in this comment section though. Rita El Khoury Well, maybe they had to, but that won't stop any developer from implementing it without any regulatory or legal requirement pushing them to do so. Nick Right, which puts this choice on the developer, not Google. Google was stuck behind a rock and hard place, perhaps. EowynCarter Well, google is certainly to blame for not planing to update my nexus 6 to android O. And now I can't even use custom rom as plan B without losing some apps :( Suicide_Note Boo hoo. Buy a new phone and quit crying that Google doesn't support phones forever. EowynCarter Fine can you order a pixel XL and ship it to me in France ? Plus, my nexus 6 still works, I hate having to replace working stuff. Makes no sense, economically and ecologically speaking. Suicide_Note I'll sell you my XL when I'm done with it, but only after i get the Pixel XL 2. :) EowynCarter Well, I do hope Google sells the "pixel 2 "( or whatever its name) here. For now, I'm'just hoping my nexus 6 don't break. Else I might jump on the iOS ship. I'm not convinced the the other android alternatives. Note 8 would be the closest, but touchwiiz, delayed updates.... I'm spoiled after a few years with a nexus. Suicide_Note There always eBay or Swappa if you want to get a first gen Pixel. I was looking at prices over the weekend, and mint condition Pixels are going for about $450. EowynCarter Not so much in France. And eBay for suff that cost more that a few bucks, too risky. Plus, the pixel is getting "old" by now. Wilton Daniel Pinto Troll found trparky Yet Microsoft still supports Windows 7 EIGHT YEARS LATER! How come Microsoft can do that yet Google can't? Alex Louderback Actually, that's Qualcomm EowynCarter Source for this ? trparky And Qualcomm can go fuck themselves. Gee... I wonder why they're being hit with an anti-trust lawsuit. Could this be one of many reasons why? trparky Yes, Google is to blame for that. There's no damn reason why your Nexus 6 can't run Android O other than the fact that they just don't want to. Bojan Bunić My bootloader was unlocked prior to changing the mobo on my 5X, courtesy of Booty Loops. Root, well, probably before I got my Nexus 4. Although I'll see how it'll go on in the future, as we don't have Pixels here, so the only near stock possibility is either OnePlus, or some other device and a custom ROM. Milton P. Agree 100% with you, I mean I remember the old days when I hated HTC's Sense, I literally decided that a phone without a camera was better than whatever HTC did back then, but Android has evolved quite a lot nowadays, don't get me wrong, I do believe that custom ROMs did a great job showing Google what the users want but that won't change, as long as someone shows Google what people want Google will keep improving Android, because there's no limits. Now if they go the Apple way and lock EVERYTHING then we'll be fucked, I'm the meantime developers will find a way around the system pushing Google along. Premsuraj An open bootloader and root actually solves a lot of problems still existing in AOSP. The Nougat update absolutely destoryed the battery life of many Nexus 6P devices, with Google only focussing on the Pixels, there was no fix in it. I unlocked, used Franco Kernel + naptime + Greenify and I now I get adequate battery life. Another feature I can think of is theming. Material design is good, but the whiteness is rage inducing Maxr1998 Well, fuck them. Let's just hope not many devs will use this, and Google won't enable this by default anytime soon. Maxr1998 The more I think about this, the more concerned I get. This will reduce the freedom over our devices, and also limit developers in the awesome things they could do before because of Android's openness. I am all in for device security and fighting against malware, trojans and phishing applications, don't understand me wrong, but that doesn't mean that you have to take people away their freedom - just look at how Linux (GNU and Linux) is doing it. Tom Westrick How does this limit developers? If anything it gives them more control. Maxr1998 Fair point, I should have been more specific. With "developers", I meant rom developers and modders, app developers only if they require root access for their apps. "Normal" developers can use this to enforce a "secure" (read: DRM locked-down) environment, but that's not really a good thing in my opinion.. (Refer to my other comments.) trparky You're angry at the wrong people, you should be angry at Hollywood; they're the ones that are demanding this kind of stuff. Their content, their rules; it's how things are in the real world. They have to do what they need to do to protect their investments, plain and simple. We don't necessarily have to like it, hell... we may even hate it, but that's how it is. You want the content? Play by their rules. Colin Richardson If you are an app developer and want your app to run on custom roms..... don't turn on "Requires SafetyNet"... bekifft We are increasingly living in the future Richard Stallman warned us about. With Google taking all these steps, may as well go back to using jailbroken iPhones. Bart Janusz I've already enabled it and I know at least 3 others devs that did it as well. I really don't care about root per se, but custom roms and xposed is source of countless problem as both are buggy as hell. Maxr1998 But in which way does that influence you? Xposed can introduce bugs to the system, sure, but it won't affect the performance of your app unless it itself is modded, so you probably don't have to fear bad reviews for bad performance anyway. And custom roms? LineageOS on my mother's Moto G runs like a champ and much better than the 5.1 stock rom before. And in my experience as a dev, there were much more incompatibilities with Samsung TouchWiz than with AOSP-based custom roms. refthemc I'm sure he's just trying to avoid the headache of emails he gets daily from users who have no idea that it's their fault the app is not working or crashing... Bart Janusz Indeed, not to mention extra crash and ANRs reports which seems to influence app positioning. Maxr1998 But why? The device may behave more buggy at some parts because of Xposed (and mine definitely ran like shit on MM because of some mods, but I NEVER blamed any apps), but the apps itself won't run worse if not modded - normally they should even run better if you only use performance mods like Greenify, NLP Collector wakelock disabler and other light mods. I don't think he gets many reports anyway, considering what @marcusmarcus2:disqus said. Bart Janusz You may not, but many users do, and as I said there are a lot of bogus ANRs and crash reports. Since my app depends heavily on low level OS elements both custom ROMs and xposed are deal breakers (and you really should check source, since I do not update my website as I moved to G+/FB but app has sizable user base given its niche and I'd to deal with ROM/xposed issues fequently). Maxr1998 Well, but the same type of users also give bad reviews etc. without using any mod or root. You generalize modders to only cause problems, and therefore lock out everyone. About your app/website thing: fair point, I didn't look at it yet, and have to apologize for being a little rude. marcusmarcus2 You need to take your own advice, "you really should check source". If you moved to G+/FB, then why does your app on the play store still point to the same website as well. Or at least put a link on the old website that directs to G+/FB. There is nothing that points to your so called G+/FB source. So @Maxr1998:disqus has no other source to check at the moment. Bart Janusz Not that I care but if you try to draw conclusion about app you should probably visit Play Store listing. Anyhow that's really not important I just chimed in to explain why developer will use this. I've choose to do so due to extra burden which in effect hurts majority of my user base, one of my colleagues cited lucky patcher and freedom (which I think is not such a good idea but its his choice). trparky You may not blame the apps because you know better but most people don't understand that, most people see a crashing app and suddenly you see, as the developer, a ton of comments saying that your app sucks. h4rr4r Please do tell us about your apps so we can be sure to avoid them on any devices we have not yet rooted. marcusmarcus2 His disqus profile leads to this website http://artflowstudio.com/ which has a few apps listed. Art oriented apps. There is only 1 update on that website since 2014, so I don't think I would be to concerned about installing one of his apps. Jordan Palmer Nice detective work. Adrian I can see a lot of refund requests coming from people who paid for apps and suddenly are told "Nope. Not for you anymore." A lot of us are rooted and buy apps and you'd better believe noise will be made if an app I use daily, that I paid for, suddenly breaks with an update because it's no longer blessed by the dev to run on my device. It's your app and you can do what you want with it, but there is always another side to the coin. BAlGaInTl That's not the way that Netflix worked it, and I doubt other developers of paid apps would either. I have a OnePlus One, that I run Lineage OS on since the original Cyanogen OS is now defunct and does not receive any updates. Netflix simply doesn't update to v 5+. It still works just fine. I may not get the newest and latest features, but part of that is on me for using a device that is dated. I'm not one of those users who, because I paid for an app once, fells that I should get all of the updates from now until the end of time. That isn't sustainable for developers. It could very well be that Netflix has some new features/offerings in the works in which they are getting pressure from outside sources to push this. A lot of valid reasons for a developer to enable the check exist. As long as they do it in the same manner that Netflix has, I don't see the issue. Adrian And just like Pokemon Go, eventually you'll get a message that you need to upgrade to the latest version or the app won't work, you know, that new version that won't let you actually log into it anymore. We've already seen this happen so let's not pretend that it isn't the next logical step. They aren't going to keep letting people sign in indefinitely with an app that doesn't have the security level they want. It's naive to think that hey I can just stick with the last version that works for root. It takes all of what, the time it takes to create a switch that says minimum version required to log in is "DRM version" BAlGaInTl Good Point. I recognize that. But it seems that the blame (in general) is being directed at Google in many of these posts. If that scenario happens, it isn't Google that blocked you from accessing Netflix. The need for this level of security is on the increase. The same users demanding better security and longer updates are the first ones to cry foul when Google starts laying the groundwork for exactly what they have asked for. Adrian I think there is a way to do both that doesn't piss off a very active community that helped take Android from a very very very ugly, second class OS to what we have now. I know a lot of us remember just how crippled Android was and it was the root/mod community that produced the bulk of what is now standard on Android. There needs to be a way to secure the devices AND not turn their back on the developer community that contributes. The idea, in Netflix's case, that root = pirate is insane. Why in the world would someone prefer to rip content on their phone to say a computer or XBox that is never going to move and can do it while you get on with your life? They're doing something for the sake of saying they're doing something, but if they think it's going to make a dent in piracy they, and the studios are nuts. I watch a lot of Netflix and still prefer to buy discs. People who do things the right way and are perfectly happy paying for content shouldn't have to jump through hoops to watch it. Those of us who root usually have a handful of things that stock Android is not doing for us. It's why we root. If all of these things were available in stock, my reasons for rooting would disappear but I don't see that happening any time soon. I think Android is getting so much better but if they make it exactly like iOS, might as well go to the dark side because Apple's apps tend to be more polished, come out first and OS updates are frequent. Don't bite the hand that feeds you just because you're getting more popular. BAlGaInTl I think that Netflix is a good example. It is HIGHLY likely that the reason for recent unpopular changes (see also VPN blocking) are being driven by other entities. It isn't that Netflix thinks its a problem, but the people that control a large portion of their content do. root pirate but it does introduce a security risk. I don't see how Google is turning their backs on developers. Developers are free to develop as they see fit and choose (at least for the moment) whether or not they will implement the SafetyNet check. The inherent problem is that a circumvented security is still circumvented and can no longer be considered secure. I can clearly see why some apps would and should frown upon that. Maybe not Netflix and Mario (IMHO), but certainly something like bank and payment apps. I don't think the inherent open nature of android will ever reduce to the level of iOS. But some changes have to occur to meet the needs/desire of the majority. Security is inherently difficult. The easier and more flexible you try to make it, the less secure it becomes. Adrian I do think banking apps should run in a secure space. Completely agree with that, but I disagree with root = less secure. My nexus devices stopped getting OS and security updates. Nothing. VERY insecure and dangerous. I rooted them, updated the OS with images from XDA developers and my devices that were once easy targets are more secure. There is always two sides to it. I see that Google is finally trying to take security seriously on Android and doing things in layers that completely cut out the vendor AND the carriers is the right step. Right now, Root is the only way to update a perfectly good device like my Nexus tablet tablet that the vendor said "oh well" to. Until Google has a REAL strategy in place to keep ALL Android devices secure, root will be necessary. Not everyone wants to or can upgrade devices every two years because they get abandoned. My father doesn't need an S8. He does need a device that gets security updates for more than a year after purchasing his phone. BAlGaInTl You are exactly correct, and I'm in the same situation with my OnePlus One. But in working to increase your security level, you leave holes behind. The key words that you used are "more secure." I agree. You are "more secure." But still (probably) less secure than a device that has been thoroughly tested, certified, and passes SafetyNet without hacks. Google has been open that they are working on security updates. They have improved significantly over the last couple years in getting those out. I feel that they are putting in place a real strategy to keep Android devices secure. This is part of that groundwork. I also feel that they are actively looking to replace Android in it's current state, and I can't say I blame them. The only real strategy may be to take lessons learned and start over. Lucky for them, they have the resources to do so. trparky > take lessons learned and start over Pretty much. The worst thing that they did from the very beginning was to allow for the OEMs to do what they wished. Google essentially made a deal with the devil when they released Android to the world. They wrote no requirements into the Android agreements that the OEMs agreed to to require updates to be a necessary thing. Big mistake Google. BAlGaInTl The really needed to in order to get their foot in the door of the market. If it would not have been open source from the beginning, none of the major manufactures would have bought off on it. The fact that they could use it for free (essentially) and still be able to customize on top of it is what sold it. trparky And now look at it, Android is a fucking mess of non-updated insecure devices that are ripe for anyone to be able to take over and turn into a botnet. trparky And you should be raising holy hell with the OEM that made that device! Just because your device is old doesn't mean that it shouldn't still be supported. Windows 7 is nearly eight years old and it still receives Windows Updates. Why can't your device? BAlGaInTl Normally, I would agree, but the OnePlus One is a special case. The OEM operating system is the now defunct Cyanogen OS. I had to balance having the original OS without updates, or running another with updates. The phone is now almost three years old. If I bought a PC with Windows on it three years ago, and Microsoft had since gone out of business, should the PC manufacturer be responsible for providing Windows 7 updates? Even though the PC is beyond it's support date? Sure, I can increase the security by switching to another OS that is updated. It may even be a Windows clone. But if a software developer decided to only support "original, unmodified" PC configurations, that would be within their right. trparky But it can be adapted to run LineageOS. Sudev There is bit difference in analogy here: OnePlus manufactured the phone and Cynogen Inc customized AOSP Android OS for it, they didn't developed it from ground up. I understand that Cynogen INC is out of business now too. However in PC world, it would be the case that you purchased a PC from Dell and get Microsoft Windows OS with some additional Dell software. If Dell or developer of that custom software goes out of business you still get OS update for your PC. Its not android OS itself out business here. Adrian and for the record, I absolutely agree that it was the content providers and not all on Netflix. trparky You should be demanding that OnePlus send an official update to your device. So what if your device is old? It should be still supported. Windows 7 is still supported nearly eight years later, why can't your device be supported for that long as well? Plumplam Who cares except for a bunch of XDA nerds? If it means better security then I'm all for it. Dmitri Smirnov Well, for starters, it doesn't mean better security, since it does nothing to address the problems with vulnerable outdated android versions that will be "certified", but will allow malicious apps to quietly escalate their privileges and do their dirty work, but will block "uncertified" custom roms that actually have all the recent secuirity patches and give user full control over who has root access and how. Also, "bunch of XDA nerds" are the source of a lot of features that had their trial run in custom ROMs and then were adopted to the AOSP. Should I remind you of "The Oak and the Pig" fable? Alienate the developers bringing new ideas to the ecosystem - lose the competetive edge you had over other OSes saf1927 Actually, custom ROMs never really have the latest security patches despite what they claim since kernels aren't maintained and no proprietary blobs is updated anymore. If ROM developers were OEMs, they'd be violating their agreements with Google by bumping the patch level without actually addressing all the vulnerabilities. Dmitri Smirnov Well they patch the AOSP to the same level as latest official one and kernel - if it's possible to do so without breaking the compatibility with compiled blobs or at least on the level of latest official firmware. So in the end run it's at least as secure as the official firmware, often - much more so. saf1927 If you look at the security bulletin, most vulnerabilities come from proprietary drivers and require these to be updated. On a supported device, these are provided by the chip manufacturers to the OEMs, on an unsupported device they aren't updated anymore. A custom ROM can only fix userspace security issues. In the end, bumping the patch level without addressing all vulnerabilities in that patch gives a false sense of security to users. Dmitri Smirnov If anything, this is an argument for forcing OEMs to opensource their blobs. For some reason community is much better at releasing the fixes for what they can change (userspace), while OEMs generally stop caring as soon as device is out the door. saf1927 The problem goes beyond OEMs unfortunately. All the phones you can buy are assembled with off-the-shelf components that they buy from other manufacturers and it is them that provide the binary blobs to the OEMs. If they stop supporting components, the OEMs can't do anything. For the chip, it's companies like Qualcomm, Samsung, Mediatek etc. that need to support it with up-to-date drivers. Once they stop, the life-cycle of a phone comes to an end. trparky And that is probably one of many reason why Qualcomm is facing a nice fat anti-trust lawsuit. Serves them right. trparky That ain't ever going to happen. There's no way they're going to allow for their intellectual property to be open for all the world to see and have it cracked open. It would be corporate suicide since their competitors would be able to reverse engineer their stuff. Suicide_Note Never heard of "The Oak and the Pig" before. Could you tell me more? Seriously. Dmitri Smirnov http://www.aliceswonderland.eu/Alice-ska350-en.html Maxr1998 Ah, Lessing. Going to read the original version in a minute :) username_not_valid Thats a very generous view of the custom ROM community. It might be true of a few, very few devs, but most ROMs are unsupported garbage with serious security issues. Dmitri Smirnov Maybe so, but out of this cesspool of garbage CyanogenMod was born, which became LineageOS. I'd say their quality standard appeals me more than a lot of OEMs. username_not_valid Cyanogen and Lineage was what i had in mind.. Each to his own i guess. BAlGaInTl Yes and no. I run Lineage on my OnePlus One because Cyanogen OS is no longer supported. I can say with certainty that Lineage introduces stability issues that I have to deal with to be up to date. Wilton Daniel Pinto Ninna pooty bewarci Qwip Consider the bigger picture. Right now, users are being shuffled into a situation where they must restrict the control they have over their device if they want to be able to use Netflix (and presumably banking apps will follow soon). That may seem fine, and from some security perspective it is probably a good thing. How much control do you have over your _laptop_? How much do you want? Right now, we're blissfully able to install unsigned software on our computers (although various OSs will complain about it), but will that last? How long will it be before we can only open our banking interface on our laptop using a trusted, digitally signed browser on a machine that is using secure boot and can only run signed binaries? I can understand the direction that Netflix (and others) are coming from, and to them it may even make sense. The question is: what is the cost of ceding control over our devices/machines in order to be able to watch netflix, etc. trparky Yeah and that's why Windows is the virus filled cesspool that it is today. Windows 10 is slowly changing Windows to be an app store based ecosystem in which all apps will be sandboxed. It's coming to the desktop near you. saf1927 I hope Magisk (or other similar mods in the future) keep working, so to prevent this. Not a problem on my Pixel XL since I haven't rooted it, but on my Nexus 5 Magisk allows it to pass Safety Net even though it's running a custom ROM (7.1.2) and it's rooted. Hendrik Leppkes SafetyNets primary purpose is to secure devices for Android Pay, and when you deal with actual money transactions on your device, you really don't want any hack interfering with it - so I'm quite certain they'll do whatever they can to break hacks like this and ensure the security and integrity of the device. h4rr4r No, its primary purpose is to make the device trustworthy for others not the person who paid for it. This is how it makes it "secure" for android pay. You are a possible threat and this closes that. Suicide_Note It would seem that Google is erecting a wall around their garden, too. EowynCarter While Apple opens iOS more and more. YouNex According to the support/help page, a device is not certified if it stops getting Android updates. How fuck up is that ? I don't get it. My Moto X has always been on stock ROM, yet it's showing up as non certified. Yes it's rooted + system modifications, but at no point is it stated that root prevents it from being certified. Suicide_Note Really? You can't understand why your rooted/system modified device is non-certified? YouNex I know how to read, but this is vague https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png "Not secure" jonzey231 Root and/or unlocked bootloader = Not certified. YouNex It says nothing about root or bootloader https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b6f710b8628f0e09ab73ba144c133a2c9b1fe1325b353ae7dc1636f2776b2ac0.png ast00 Can't wait until LastPass excludes root users... Fuck them. Adonis K. If they do, I'm cancelling my subscription... Naxx ENVY Fuck them and yet they haven't done anything yet ... #internetlogic Also i know right , crazy for a company that stores your passwords to make themselves more secure . ABSOLUTE CRAZY , RAGE RAGE RAGE Jordan Palmer I don't understand your reasoning or rationale for these two statements. ast00 The second part is related to Google. Sorry about the confusion. Believe it or not, most of us root users keep SELinux in it's Enforcing state. This means we are safe. Nothing gets root rights without us knowing. Our phones are just as safe if not safer than most stock phones. JATIN BANSAL SafetyNet test can be passed using Magisk Manager. I am using it and it works fine for me. Even in play store, my device is certified. May be this helps someone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3756499ff5876545740cd0e88e38961bb2c327d90fc43f5801f4bce5d802c990.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/44185f640490cb506a68a3414579bd345123f7d52ee2e11802d31d5141db11ae.png Nick Most people are worried about the future when the exploits that Magisk uses are patched and it continues to make it harder for people to get around this. JATIN BANSAL That's what I am also worried about. I just posted this for those who are already rooted and for now want to keep the root. My main purpose of rooting was to flash lineage OS. I think custom rom is the only way of staying updated to latest version of Android as google itself doesn't update their phones after 2 years (18 months I think) for reasons they have. I think if someone buys a flagship device which costs 700$+, it should have 3-4 years of full software update support. 😆😄 2 years of major OS version updates and 3 years of security patches. After 3 years, its time to buy a new phone cuz its so old anyway. trparky Says you! Windows 7 was released on July 22, 2009 and they still support it EIGHT YEARS LATER! And they plan on supporting it until the year 2020 which means it will be supported for a total of ELEVEN YEARS! If Microsoft can do it, Google can too!!! Does Microsoft suddenly say "Your machine is too old, go buy a new one"? No, they continue to give you Windows Updates for years later. We should also be demanding that the Android OEMs do so as well. A Samsung Note 5 has more than enough hardware in it to run Android 7 but no... we can't do that, we need to make money so we don't update them to force you to buy a new device. Lambdadelta Magisk...alright, thanks for the tip-off. I really must get it. TadMSTR Magisk doesn't always pass SafetyNet. I have some devices it fails on. However, several other devices it works just fine. Make sure you turn on the hide root option, it's off by default. Lambdadelta Well, I do have a problem, and that is my device is not able to download it directly from Google Play, so I have to get the APK from XDA. I dunno why this is the case for my phone though. Is it because it's a 4.4.4? Either way, I'll get the APK moved to my phone later tonight. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson I have activated hide root option, and it passes SafetyNet, but in Google Play Store, it still shows uncertified. What app should I hide root from to get Play Store to show Certified? JATIN BANSAL As per XDA: Q: Safety Net fails after enabling MagiskHide A: Magisk can only hide Magisk core features, for Magisk modules it depends on what the module does. If your ROM itself is not able to pass SafetyNet, then there is nothing Magisk can help. Your best bet is 100% stock ROMs, because your phone manufacturer is forced to release a device passing CTS. Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson What in Magisk Hide did you check/how did you do it? Google Play Store? Or Play services? Because here it says uncertified :( JATIN BANSAL Just clear app data of play store. Now it will show your device certified Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson Thanks! Muzaffar I believe that root and custom rom makes android what it is now. This feels like betrayal for Android enthusiast. username_not_valid Well maybe in the very early days (maybe), but not any more. Rooted phones make up a tiny fraction of active devices. Muzaffar It's not about active devices. It's about how android develop together with community (well as i remember) I believe that those "rooted user" contribute many things that make android right now. I still remember status bar (and nav bar) color change was implemented on Kitkat before it becomes official on lollipop. Also, we can't forget how badly mobile active network bug happens in lollipop if it's not those "rooted user" who found out the fix via xposed. and i believe there are still more. trparky We can blame the OEMs for that kind of stuff because of things like locked bootloaders, eFuses, etc. username_not_valid Or we can blame ROM makers for it because they kept breaking the devices causing warranty claims. Naxx ENVY no offence but that's small thinking ... i'd say 90% of people on Android devices don't want or even know about root, heck it may even be 95% ... security is more of a concern, sure it annoys us geeks, but that's the 5% at most. Muzaffar And about half of android devices is left outdated. Not to mention bugs that unsolved on previous android. I'll pick a dumb phone instead, if android becomes a closed platform. trparky And truth be told that's why I have an iPhone. I simply got sick and tired of the lack of updates so I told myself I'm going to the iPhone and have been happy ever since. OK sure, it may not have all of the customization features that Android has but I can be guaranteed that I will get software and security updates on time, every time, regardless of my carrier of choice. refthemc I think you misread his comment, he's saying that root and custom roms got Android to where it is TODAY not saying that it is necessary TODAY. And I agree. trparky It pretty much comes down to this. Google is simply targeting a much larger piece of the pie. You can't blame them for trying to do what is necessary to protect not only the platform but the Android brand itself. Qwip Well, it isn't like there is anywhere else to go though, is it? Google can basically throw enthusiasts who have promoted and fostered android development under the bus - they don't need them any more. trparky Money trumps community. Always has, always will. username_not_valid Ad blocking was the last holdout reason to root for me, but even thats no longer a good reason with things like Adhell, Adguard etc I have no other reason to root now, custom ROMs are generally garbage, and bloat can usually be uninstalled or disabled, so its just not needed. Adonis K. custom ROMs have nothing to do with root... thevigilante Custom ROMs have uncertified flag in Play Store Mike Avellanosa Not all, though George Byers My Nexus 7 2013 is passing safteynet running Lineage unrooted. Wilton Daniel Pinto Let me guess, you have a Pixel. Or you wouldn't call custom ROMs bloated while the reality is other way round username_not_valid Wouldn't touch a Pixel actually. username_not_valid Should be noted that I didn't call custom ROMs bloated, I guess you misread it. Wilton Daniel Pinto Oh yeah, I misread it . My bad Zach Mauch This is going to cause the same problem I see in governments work with security. They will blindly block things like root and bootloader unlock regardless of if it poses any credible threat because it FEELS more secure. Blah!!!!!! Naxx ENVY it IS more secure, not just " feels" h4rr4r More secure for them, not for me the owner of the device. Besides, not even for them in the long term. An up to date ROM has many exploits patched that a two versions out of date and 12 months behind on security patches OTA has. Zach Mauch What I mean is they will apply restrictions because they easily can and it gives a warm fuzzy for them. They will do this regardless of the impact to the user. The analogy here is that in my job I am constantly unnecessary restrictions and bureaucracy that make doing my job much more difficult. For instance, we are disallowed from using remote desktop on standalone computer networks. It would make our job MUCH MUCH easier in many circumstances and save money on software as I could remote into my PC from anywhere in the building. Yet they deny us that and claim security. jonzey231 So this will force people to install apps from unauthorized sources, thus making the whole Android malware issue that much more prevalent. Great.. Suicide_Note Unless being held at gunpoint, no one is forced to install apps from unauthorized sources. That's a user's CHOICE. jonzey231 You know what I mean. Stop playing devil's advocate on everyone's posts. Eric Braun He's not incorrect. Kyle R Krcmaric "Stop providing an alternate viewpoint to my own." It's just comments. Anyway, I think Google also announced that even sideloaded apps will get scanned by their new Google Play Protect service, which may help nullify the risk of sideloading in the first place. d0x360 That's not an alternate viewpoint unless your view is "don't install any apps ever" There is no logical argument to defend this move by Google. None. username_not_valid Yes there is. Come content creators will not allow a provider to support a rooted or otherwise compromised device. Right or wrong in your eyes thats the reality, and in order for Android to be able to have such services Google have to do this. d0x360 What you said isn't an alternate viewpoint lol you are just repeating the reason Google is doing this which everyone agrees is a fact. As for this new comment...a rooted phone isn't compromised. Tell me...what would a rooted user do with Netflix that would make Netflix want to block them? Are they worried about people copying movies because if they think Android is the vector for that action they are idiots. All they are doing is making a problem by allowing bad actors to inject malware into a Netflix apk that could be installed by both root and unrooted users. Genius! Give me 1 good reason to block rooted phones from an app like oh I dunno, Mario run or whatever it's called. Any answers you give are false. Wanna know why? Hacked apks exist to allow cheating and they can be installed by anyone rooted or not. In fact I'd stake my life that your average unrooted user is installing more modified apk files to cheat in games or whatever than any rooted user. People who root are generally better educated about the Android eco system and do less dumb stuff. As for Netflix I cancelled my account on the day they did this and now I just use a friends account so they lost a subscriber due to this move and I rarely ever used the app. Sure 1 person closing an account that's existed since the day they opened isn't going to do much but I vote with my wallet and if a company does something I dislike then they simply don't get my money. The first person I asked gave me their login info and I made a profile. It's just like how I share my HBO subscription with someone else. Easy easy. username_not_valid See my previous comment. Its not for me to argue, the fact is content providers want it, fair or not, end of story, therefore its going to happen. The tiny number of rooters out there are meaningless to them, and Google. Netflix has to do this because the providers of its non-original content demand it. Its not Netflix fault, they either do it or lose shows. Losing large amounts of their content would affect their subscription base several orders of magnitude more than losing rooted users, who chances are, use the service on more than their phone or tablet anyway. d0x360 Once again I ask... what about a rooted device is dangerous to an app and also this is now a second question, what makes it compromised? BAlGaInTl Clearly you've made up your mind on the issue, but I'll give it a go. It isn't necessarily the root that is dangerous to an app or vice versa. The compromise comes from other apps/processes that can take advantage of root. If you don't understand that, then you don't understand what root really is. It has a lot of valuable uses, but it can also be dangerous. To address your previous statement, just because it rubs me the wrong way. So your "solution" was to cancel your Netflix account and then steal the content? So clearly, you aren't "actually" affected by the change, because you can still watch Netflix. You do realize that watching their content is also valuable to them and makes them money? If you want to boycott Netflix for their practices, then by all means do. Otherwise, it just comes across as hypocritical IMHO. d0x360 I don't believe I asked you. No I'm not stealing Netflix content, it's being paid for and Netflix has many times in the past encouraged account sharing. Of course they did so in the hopes you would join but they still allow it. I paid my Netflix dues. Day 1 4 disc member, then as soon as it was available I upgraded to the 4k 4 user package. It's not piracy either, I'm not recording or distributing the content. If Netflix wants to dick with me I'll dick with them. I never said this was permanent but I vote with my wallet. Vote cast. I also haven't used Netflix once since that day despite being able to. I've been using Amazon and Microsoft video where I own over 500 movies so you can stuff the whole theft argument. I've bought more content than most and that doesn't include my DVD, Blu-ray, and uhd Blu-ray collection which is well over 1400 movies and TV shows at this point. Your right...I've been rooting since the first Android phone but I totally don't understand the possibilities. My argument is simple. The overwhelming majority of root users don't mess with apps. To hell with that nonsense argument anyways. What is the danger to Netflix? Copying movies? Please...it's a million times easier to do it on a PC. Even windows xp can handle it without issue. Does Netflix and you I suppose really think root users are using the app to steal content? If so how? Show me one forum topic, one article, one modified Netflix apk that allows downloading and bypassing their drm. I'm begging you. Just 1. BAlGaInTl I reviewed the Netflix TOS, and I will agree that you are not stealing. I'll even remove the verbiage from my post. Netflix does not make any such stipulation. They speak only of the "Account Owner" and "Devices." I guess I just assumed that, and that's my bad. As I've said in other posts... It isn't all about Netflix. A large part of it is about their content. They really can't argue that point with providers. You either play by their rules, work to establish new rules, or choose not to carry them. Netflix wants to stay relevant on all platforms. That's the main danger to Netflix. In addition, I shouldn't have to give an example in the wild of an exploit. Just because it is difficult to find doesn't mean it doesn't exist. What if someone else writes an app that uses root to mine user account data from Netflix? Should Netflix not be worried about protecting user data? If that happens, who is responsible for the security and the bad press? Probably not Netflix, but they would certainly be impacted. I checked my app really quick (which is stuck on version 4 because I'm affected). Since Netflix keeps you logged in for convenience (that's spelled out in their terms), a quick look gives my full name, username, phone number, zip code, the brand of payment card, and the last 4 digits of that card. That's quite a bit of information that can easily be gathered by a piece of Malware. Now as I said... Netflix probably wouldn't be liable if a user was compromised because of root. It would certainly be a danger to their business however. Why should the be asked to take that risk? It seems to me that they are approaching this in a realistic manner, and rolling it out in a reasonable way. Would this affect the majority of root users? Probably not. By their nature, root users will find ways around it anyway. The problem is that the impact to Netflix from losing content and/or a compromised app is disproportionate the loss of blocking root users. It's simply a numbers game, and you can't blame Netflix for that. And you certainly can't blame Google who is trying to improve security. username_not_valid Thats not for me to decide, or argue, the fact is the content providers have decided that rooting is a risk to their copyrighted content, and as such services like Netflix, Amazon, and other streaming services must comply and lock out rooted devices. Passing safetynet and using Googles DRM framework is the easiest way to claim due diligence, so thats what they will do, and in order to keep Android competitive Google is providing the tools needed to make it possible. What I will argue though is that your notion that custom ROMs etc are more secure is unfounded. The best might well be, but there are hundreds of completely random and unchecked ROMs out there that could contain absolutely anything, you cant possibly claim that custom ROMs are inherently safer or more secure than OEM ROMs, outdated or not. jonzey231 So let's play this out: If someone takes the Netflix .apk and mods it with malware and then signs it, it will pass installation on the device. 1. User opens app. 2. App does whatever shitty thing it's designed to do while the user thinks they just got around the block. 3. The OS scans the app and warns the user it's been modified and they should uninstall it. 4. User thinks "Ha! I know and that's why it works!" 5. User keeps app until they get a call from Credit Karma that their identity was probably stolen but they don't know how. 6. Person spends 6 months fixing stolen identity. But still uses that app the whole time. Ultimately, that user is still going to be screwed. Would you or I make this mistake? No. Would your cousin's friend's dad because he had his son root so he could tether for free and overheard you guys talking about sideloading apps and googled how to do it? Yes. Randroid Problem is, even in your scenario, root has nothing to do with it. Someone who is not rooted could do the same thing. The only problem is, now MORE people who root are going to be *forced* to look for a modified apk because the official apk is not available from the Play Store. So in the end, it's causing more problems than it's fixing. Corbin Baxter Here's the thing about rooting: when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. This just helps discourage rooting, which can alter a new users perspective on Android, or make someone reconsider getting an Android device. someone755 For what it's worth, back in 2011/2010, many of us bought into Android *because* we could root. Imagine the possibilities of being in control of so much more of your system than with any mobile OS prior; We've spent hundreds (some, thousands) of dollars in this environment, on devices, apps, books etc. I understand this isn't how things stand nowadays, but root is still prevalent because of one issue that Google will not fix (or at least, won't until O+ is running on the majority of devices, but that'll take two years at the minimum), and those are updates and vendor apps (i.e. bloatware). If my phone is stuck on Lollipop I'm going to root it; I'll be able to mitigate the memory leak performance drops, and overall customize the device to fit my specific needs -- I've made quite a few friends (think ROM and kernel devs) because I just wanted to put a thermal engine better than Qualcomm's horrendous MPDecision into the kernel directly (i.e. I took the kernel source and modified it to fit my needs). What Google is trying to do here is, yes, discourage rooting, but instead of fixing the root cause (heh) behind why people root in the first place (that is, again, customizability and personal(ized) performance tuning, in large part to keep devices on older Android versions alive), root wouldn't be necessary. In the long run this *might* fix the symptom, but it most definitely will not help in fixing the cause. And that's because the cause is Google itself. As if apps like Snapchat blocking power users from their apps wasn't enough, now there's this -- If it becomes so common that even Google's own apps start to utilize the feature, I'll be gone to another mobile platform within a month. That might mean iOS, it might mean S60v3, I'll know that if (or rather, when) it happens. tl;dr: Google is putting a band-aid on a shotgun wound. Corbin Baxter I'm speaking mainly for new Android users. They don't feel as comfortable rooting. Doing this makes Android SEEM more like iOS. This doesn't MAKE Android like iOS. New users are comfortable with that. This is the same issue Microsoft had with Windows 8/8.1. Classic users, and Windows enthusiasts, hated someone changing the way they would use their computers. Microsoft introduced a different way of doing things, and to enthusiasts, it was bad, no matter how good it might be. Google's Project Treble should mostly fix the fragmentation problem, therefore giving Android users one less reason to root. To us enthusiasts, nothing can beat rooting, but it might not be the best solution to the problems Android has. Google seems intent on fixing the problems rooting tries to solve, but in a higher-quality and reliable way. No hard feelings😉 trparky They won't understand that, they're too blinded by their geek rose colored glasses. Corbin Baxter I don't expect everyone to understand, but I'll be happy if even a small handful understand what Google is doing here. someone755 I don't think that's true -- new Android users will soon enough become old ones, and with that they'll learn that the platform (especially update-wise) is a mess without some system privileges beyond those needed to change the display brightness. Not being to use the core functions of the ecosystem that we pay to use because we decide we deserve to have more control over the devices we pay for is absolutely on Apple's level, if not made worse because of the implication that this OS is somehow different from iOS. Windows Vista was a revolutionary piece of software, and people hated it. Why? Because what was expected from Microsoft was both huge change as well as keeping everything as it is -- and Vista was exactly that: an OS modern enough to be the core basis for Windows 7, and an inspiration for features several years into the future (Vista pioneered almost every feature that W7 had), with many similarities to Windows XP. But naturally because of the expectations, the OS failed miserably, being fondly remembered by nobody (with the exception of a few people, including myself). The ones who vote and voice their opinion are not always the brightest of people. Google's Treble is sure to mitigate Android's fragmentation *to some extent*, but it'll take several years for it to reach the majority of devices (based on the data that Nougat, today, works on 10% of devices, including custom ROM-ed ones, which, when talking about custom Android O ROMs, won't count towards the number of devices supporting Treble). We can't say this is unexpected -- after all, Google does bring features into Android that enthusiasts developed before official implementation. But this is a moot point if we consider that these things usually take at least three years. Tethering, using camera flash as a torch, quick settings and editing quick settings, even night light -- these are all root features that, when first introduced, were community hacks to improve Android devices, and they are all part of Google's Android (AOSP, even) today. If Google discourages rooting, they discourage development of future Android features, which are, historically, largely taken from the operating system's community of developers and enthusiasts. If that is how things must be in pursuit of a false sense of security and tighter control over the platform in the hopes of improving its quality, so be it. But saying that this is the platform I once adored is false -- if anything, this is its polar opposite; something we knew back in 2011 as "iOS". Corbin Baxter Android can still be rooted, and I don't think that Google is going to take that away. Dmitri Smirnov > when you alter your devices software like that, then Google shouldn't be responsible for anything that comes afterwards for the user. As if right now Google or the OEMs are in any ways responsible for the malware or unpatched firmware vulnerabilities that stay this way for year. But yes, the users that root are the problem. Corbin Baxter For unrooted phones, yes Google and OEMs are very responsible. But after you root, Android loses most of its security and stability, and rooting is basically tinkering with core system files. Google doesn't have any control over what the user can or can't do after that. someone755 I respectfully disagree. There is no loss in stability aside from the forced Knox/SafetyNet/whatever software alerts from OEMs and Google, and there's definitely no loss in security -- if anything, the system is more secure because of my control over apps' privileges (i.e. I am free to control what apps do on my device, including stopping data theft by apps like Facebook etc). Why Google would have to be responsible for what a person does with their phone is beyond me -- the warranty doesn't cover it, and there are warnings of dos and don'ts plastered most everywhere online. (I'd very much like to say here that if you can't follow simple instructions you should go back to using tin cans on a string, but I realize that way 90% of the population would be excluded from the money making machine.) Simply put, I don't understand why Google would care over what the user can or can't do, as long as the user isn't somehow hurting the company (which, with root alone, they aren't and can't). Corbin Baxter You have a good point... bekifft That wasn't even a devil's advocate, that was a straight up strawman. Frosted Butts Yes.. please tell me about all the Netflix alternatives i can install, that can legally stream from Netflix...... Right now, if i am rooted and want Netflix (a service i am paying for), i must go through 3rd party app stores to install the APK. There is no choice at all... R Firestone ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Umm you have the choice to unroot your device. Maxr1998 ..which is a bad choice for many. d0x360 Yes you do except I rooted my device to make it MORE secure. Unrooting would make my device less secure than sideloading apps would. username_not_valid People can keep saying that, but the content providers have no way to know whether or not you have taken measures to secure your custom device, whereas if they go down this root they know its handled. BAlGaInTl "whereas if they go down this root they know its handled" I see what you did there. 😆😄 ...or just watch Netflix from Chrome! You could even do this from a Linux box with root! 😃 Suicide_Note Sure there is: unroot. Problem solved. neoKushan "I've solved this problem by creating 3 more problems - but it IS solved!" Eric Braun https://www.amazon.com/Netflix-Inc/dp/B005ZXWMUS Option C .. ?? h4rr4r A choice that is now more popular. dcdttu It's not so much about what a user chooses to do. It's about probability. The probability that sites are going to try to lure users into downloading malware-infected Netflix APKs from 3rd party sites is going to go up if you can't download it from a safe source in the first place. This is just like the fact that, if you don't give drug users a safe and clean place to shoot up, they're going to go do it somewhere else that's much more dangerous. Both of these scenarios are bad for society in general, no matter what the original intention was. kgptzac 1/10. Gotta try harder. My1 if you are rooted and wanna watch netflix on mobile, you have not much choice. Premsuraj How? Google Play Protect will still catch malicious apps makapav Yes but you're potentially making people venture through shady sites to get the APKs. Eric Braun Or to Amazons App store or Fdroid. The people going to shady sites are already going there, this isn't going to increase the traffic by any real amount. tehboogieman Are you sure that Google will continue allowing GPP for unlocked or rooted users going forward? Not to mention that it's not a silver bullet for 0days d0x360 It barely works as is. There are tons of apps that slip through every day. Krebs on security reports on them quite frequently. I don't trust Google's scanning of apps at all which is why I root. I can make my phone more secure and I can also image the device as often as I want so if something does happen it's fixed within 5 min. If I unroot then I lose the protection along with the backups. Premsuraj Custom ROMs and root can't protect from 0days either. And just out of curiosity how is root going to provide more security? If anything it makes the device less secure tehboogieman Nobody said root makes a device more secure. Blocking root users from downloading apps from the Play Store puts users at more risk since those users will be more inclined to sideload apps from sources that might not be as reliable as the Play Store. Premsuraj The only people who cares about this are the people who root. And those user's generally tend to be more knowledgeable about what kind of apps and app stores they can trust. ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ And only <2% of users will do this to keep rooted. xxTheGoDxx Only the plus 50 - 100 Million users that have root: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.supersu ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You do realize that that's just downloads right? ...not active users. blindexecutioner I'm not mad. I continue to use things like magisk to help get around stuff like this. All this will do is encourage me to use unauthorized sources for offending apps if magisk ever stops working. There is a reason I use Android over iOS and it certainly isn't because the apps are better designed or whatever. brian. Magisk is a good way around this. However, I don't know how long this will last. I would think with security in mind and developers trying to monetize more, it will put pressure on Google to make SafetyNet get triggered much easier. Obviously, I don't have any way of knowing, but this could easily turn into a cat and mouse game more than it already is. Android Pay was first, other apps did it like Super Mario Run, which who cares, but now Netflix? Changes are coming, and it doesn't look good for the rooting community. D13H4RD2L1V3 I'm not sure if everyone gets why some of us went through the trouble of gaining SU access. Sure, maybe there's a few who went through all that trouble for nefarious purposes (and maybe that got regulatory bodies concerned to the point where Google even needed to consider this) but from my perspective at least, a lot of us gain Superuser access mainly to get features that we liked on other Android flavors, especially in the case of a build of Android that's very close to Google's vision. Such as the ability to hide the navbar at any time we wanted and also to gain theming support (which I feel should be added officially sooner rather than later because I absolutely hate how Google is making their already-bright UI even more eye-searing with even more white-colored elements, which also makes the benefits of OLED much less obvious). I wouldn't be as concerned if these features were pushed to AOSP soon, but as it stands, I feel that Google should probably think about making these features available soon. Marty Thank the bad apples for why you no longer have freedom. Jeremy ディリマ Would changing region firmware with Odin flag the SafetyNet check on Samsung mobiles? Soz if it's a stupid question a lot has changed since I last fiddled with Android Christopher Robert This was a long time coming. Once root user started using root to pirate software, and/or get around geo locks, instead of using it to add feature to their firmware or improve their devices performance, it was only a matter of time before it all got torn down. h4rr4r Get around geo locks? You mean have my device report the location I want it to report? Yeah, how terrible that I control what my computer does. dizel123 You still do. This doesn't affect that at all h4rr4r You said the justification for that was people using their devices for their own reasons in the way they liked. I was pointing out that this is a normal thing and not something that should be punished. Cuvis You don't need root to pirate. You never did. Marty Apple says, Thank you. h4rr4r Sounds like we need a new FREE platform. Maybe Amazon can use this to push their store. mxwp but will the Netflix from the Amazon App Store work on rooted phones? Curt RIP Root. I'm not moving from stock anymore, just cab with the hassle. Until there's a 'reliable' way to hide from Safety Net, I'll enjoy my Android Pay, banking apps and overall smoothness. (If it was up to me, I'd be rooted with Linage) h4rr4r IOS is the platform for you. That was the deal from the beginning. hp-fourtwenty magisk....giyf .y phone is rooted with lineage 14.1, and passes safetynet. problem solved! jcopernicus Fantastic news. Lawstorant All this butthurt for what? You all sound like Magisk doesn't exist. Dave Hamilton Lets take Apple and there closed source. Lets take Google and there open source, the freedom to do and change as you please to make the device yours. No two devices have to be the same. Lets get 115 million android users, and then start deciding you no longer have this choice and freedom to do what you want! When something gets better and better, its only a matter of time before all the things you love are removed and comersilised Eric Braun You still have the option to do what you want. However like everything there are reactions for every action. Want to root or unlock your device? Sure, however there may be a few apps that no longer appear in the playstore. May want to have a backup like Amazon App Store or something similar ready. No one is stopping you, feel free to do as you please. tehboogieman Man, if I have to choose between having a device with root or a device with apps that use day to day, the iPhone goes from a 1% chance of being my daily driver to about 50% There are still a lot that can Android can do that iOS can't, but if I'm living in a walled garden the iPhone is looking pretty attractive. 5+ years of official OS support, solid retail network for quick service or hardware exchanges. The Play Store is my main source of apps that I know are vetted and generally safe. I have no desire to manage app updates manually. There is always a chance that someone will build and maintain an appstore that will have all root blocked apps (maybe the future of APKMirror?). If not it might be the death of Android for users like me Eric Braun Even without all of this I would use an APKMirror App that allowed for updating of apps automatically. dizel123 Google gives app developers more control over their apps. Whiny entitled internet crybabies go on the internet and whine and cry. Aka...Thursday neoKushan Alternatively: Google restricts users from using their device, which they own, how they see fit. dizel123 Except Google isn't restricting anyone from doing anything. But being 100% wrong has never stopped anyone in the internet NubCake being an asshole (in your case) hasn't stopped anyone from commenting eather it seems. dizel123 I can admit to being an asshole. But I'm also right so it's all good. neoKushan It's certainly not stopping you. dizel123 I haven't experienced it so of course it's not stopping me trparky You may own the hardware but you don't own the software, you only have a license to use it. Csöpi Thats so greate. I have a stock oneplus one and for some strange reasons i was failing the test beforhand, but now its all green. Still cant update the netflix app hence chromecast isnt working either anymore. Not really happy. JC If there's a will there's a way. brian. If more developers get on board with this, I can't see why I would switch to Android. I've always been curious about new Android phones, bought a bunch and rooted them all if I could. This is not good for a person like me. d0x360 If Google keeps this up and app devs include the api to block rooted phones then my days using Android will be over and Google will have lost a user who's been there since the g1. I don't know what I'd switch to... probably windows mobile because I'm not a fan of apple whatsoever. It's really a shame because if I had to guess I'd say 99.99% of people who root do so for either the added security and or customized experiences. For example I use root to modify my status bar and quick panel as well as firewall my apps and use adaway and yes Google I do whitelist sites that aren't obnoxious with their ads. John Doe All the more reason for the APK mirror appstore LoL Jan-Lk Else Yeah Google want's us to buy tooooo expensive phones to just get the latest Android, because cheap phones suck at updates and so they need to be flashed and rooted... trparky But if the community raises holy hell with the OEMs then maybe it will be corrected. There's no damn reason why a three year old device can't be updated when an eight year old Windows 7 machine is still receiving Windows Updates. McStagger WHY DOES NETFLIX CARE IF THE PHONE IS ROOTED?!?!?!?! mxwp Netflix does not care, but the content creators that make the stuff you see on Netflix do care. They care because they are idiots who think it is easier to pirate from rooted phones. bekifft Again, Google becomes more and more restrictive. I switched from iPhone because the screens were too small, and Google was far less restrictive. Both of those issues are now resolved, and Google's upped the price of their device to match Apple. May as well switch back to iPhone, Google seems to support it just as much as Android anyway. Luxferro Except it's not just rooted users! Any device with an unlocked bootloader. hp-fourtwenty Your comment sucks for misinforming users about what safetynet is....has NOTHING to do with unlocked bootloaders. Luxferro Sure it does. My Nexus 6P only has an unlocked bootloader, and Netflix disappeared from the play store after the last update. And I'm not the only one, so I suggest you do some reading. TechGuy22 more reason for me to pirate hey, have at it Matías Duarte I hope Netflix does the same with Jailbroken iOS devices. Why they do this btw? To prevent people recording their movies? You can do that with Windows.. Knowledgeborn Allah In all honesty, that'll probably never happen. Jailbreaking iOS opens the doors to a lot of customization on an iPhone, but the security issues are often minimal (with the exception being not having the latest software version). Jailbreaking is pretty much filtered through the Cydia platform. You don't have access to the entire system with a jailbreak. Rooting is completely different, because you can completely reshape the core OS. fbl Note : I don't work for Netflix so I can't comment for them. Possible causes : - the right holders might be pushing for this. I work on roughly the same product area and we don't implement DRM because we like them, we implement them because we contractually have to. -Netflix is tired of getting low notes because of crashes coming by shitty hacks in custom roms. Zach Mauch Anyone know how chromebooks will be affected by this? Will dev mode being enabled cause you to fail SafetyNet Checks? That is currently the only way to install apks on Chromebooks. Branko But Android AOSP!11 -Google 2011 How the times how changed. Wayne Randall ALT arguement, because I don't have time to read every comment... This doesn't limit me and my rooted N6P at all, this move limits how much money they (the devs and Google) are going to make. I can't buy it (the app or coins, or special characters, or bonus content, w/e) if I can't see it. Plain and simple. The important apps will still be there. No app is worth unroot. Block Project Fi from root though... weeeellll. I guess I'd unroot for that. mxwp yeah, only Netflix, banks, and big names will use these blocks. i am guessing most devs want as much exposure as possible. PVL_93_RU Google is actively trying to kill the modding community. Not the Custom ROM makers, but people who root and install Xposed. All because they compromise the security for Android Pay I fear the day root and Xposed apps start disappearing from the Play Store trparky If it comes to security vs being open, security will always win (or at least should always win). Eric Koop I had my Shaw Gateway app update yesterday and they changed it so it doesn't work if rooted. So I had to uninstall and find an APK online of an older version. Now it's just a matter of time before I forget and re-install the update. What a pain... disqus_em5YfkbWdk Well this would certainly get me to cancel Netflix. My personal Plex server is far better than Netflix could ever be anyway. Vivek Rameses Becoming apple more and more every day. Disgusting. Knowledgeborn Allah Android is starting to look more and more like iOS with each update... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ trparky Open platforms rarely stay open once the Benjamins start rolling in. hp-fourtwenty Go ahead and block me...I'll just pirate your app. Play nice and so will I. Start poking me and I'll poke back by never giving you another penny. App devs can't beat XDA devs. It's not going to happen. My unlocked, rooted, rommed and modded device still passes safety net. The day that stops, so does the flow of money leaving my hands on the play store. Luxferro Lay off the sodas.... UniBroW Question, can those of you without access to Netflix on Google play, can it be installed from the Amazon App Store? Stanley C. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd381b7e8a39df74c4725712a0db906098c965e9ee4194b6e01e020fd69ee566.png Thats how magisk is made... Magic! Marti Abernathey Yawn. I've got a rooted device and just installed Netflix... because? Magisk. As soon as they made this choice I cancelled. Not because I can't get around it, but because they make me do that. mrjayviper even on a non-rooted LOS mis 5s+, I cannot install Netflix. unlocking the bootloader already tripped safety. And I don't want to root. The features available in non-rooted LOS is enough for me. Teh BuG No. Bueno. TedPhillips Sigh. What's the over-under on this becoming pervasive in the play store... MicroG / Fdroid I'm coming soon. World needs a solid single alternative gcm replacement to catch on. TedPhillips As far as the potential for support overhead, being rooted is generally less than the pain coming from the Xposed/magisk crowd. You need to be actively interfering with an app via root vs code being injected into low levels of the framework that everything uses. TedPhillips I think the best outcome could be that Google opens up their process for little guys to certify there own rom builds, ala let's encrypt lowering friction on getting ssl setup. AOSP should not be a functionally useless base implementation for I'm roms, but something you can use in​ practice. TedPhillips Hey guys, don't worry. Google says Android is for everyone. https://www.android.com/everyone/ That includes AOSP developers too, right? That website seems to tread the line pretty carefully, ala 'no one is forcing you use Google play' but Hiroshi's quote seems like it comes with a grain of salt since he owns Play. I'd love to see AP interview him about this. qkjDlav As an app developer for a large app used globally, the two biggest time wasters in a developer's life are a) debugging device specific issues (HTC, Samsung, etc) and b) crash logs with Xposed in the stack trace. Developers are tired of having to sit around with device farms at their desks just to make sure new features and changes work with each quirky variant of Android that manufacturers want to deploy, and custom roms do make it worse. Enthusiasts are welcome to customize their own versions of Android and sideload apps, but we don't want to see crashlogs in the Developer Console from rooted/custom ROM users. And companies probably don't want to keep paying us to debug issues that only a small minority of users will see. Lê Nguyên Chương Most stupid thing I've ever heard in my life.

Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge: 6 Weeks With Android Nougat Purity Article Index:    Living On Google's Pixel XL, Coming From A Different Galaxy Pixel XL vs GS7 Edge Industrial Design – Beauty Is In The Eye Operating System, Software And Camera – Google Victory And A Draw Google Pixel XL And Daydream View Performance And Final Analysis – Google Pixel XL Vs. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Living On Google's Pixel XL, Coming From A Different Galaxy When Google set out to develop and market its first Phone by Google branded device - not co-branded with a partner - and spiritual successors to its legacy Nexus brand, the company drew a line in the sand. Not only was the target to develop smartphones that demonstrated best of breed functionality and performance for the Android platform, but these devices would have features and capabilities not found in other Android devices on the market. To date, very few other smartphones, save for the LG V20 for example, are running Android 7 Nougat and there are only a handful of phones on the market currently that support Google’s Daydream VR headset technology. Google Daydream VR is a compelling answer to smartphone VR solutions like Samsung Gear VR, but what’s really interesting to many consumers is how Google’s latest flagship handset compares experientially versus other hot-selling Android devices, like Samsung’s Galaxy S7 series. As a perennial Samsung Galaxy S series user, I decided it was high time, beyond just the sterile confines of a product review, to live with Google’s latest Android purist device for an extended period of time. I’ve spent quality time with Nexus devices in the past, but the Google Pixel XL, with its 5.5-inch AMOLED display, felt like a possible successor as a daily driver for me. So, here are my high level take-aways of a Galaxy S7 Edge to Pixel XL migration, from hardware to software, and creature comforts. Our hands-on video walk-around of the Google Pixel XL with Daydream View Pixel XL vs Galaxy S7 Edge – The Display Goes To Samsung I’m going to get this one out of the way early. If your primary focus is on the display in a handset, there is just no comparison to Samsung’s Super AMOLED displays currently, especially the curved glass of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Google’s Pixel XL AMOLED display does a reasonably good job of reproducing the saturation, contrast and pop of the Galaxy S7 Edge, but it’s not quite as bright, nor does it have quite the viewing angle capability.  There’s also no substitution for the effect of the curved, edge-to-edge display on the Galaxy S7 Edge. The Pixel XL (seen here above) is flanked with more bezel and the display itself is not quite as close to the glass as the GS7 Edge. So oddly enough, if you’re a pixel snob, the Galaxy S7 Edge actually wins over Google's namesake Pixel XL. That's not to say the Pixel XL is hampered in any way from an image quality standpoint; it's just once you've seen what Samsung's curved 5.5-inch display can do, there's nothing quite like it currently. Although, admittedly, close seconds are indeed the Google Pixel XL as well as the Moto Z.  Power Efficiency And Battery - A Landslide Win For The Pixel XL Here’s where the always-on benchmark numbers, versus real world anecdotal use case, vary greatly.  The Galaxy S7 Edge has a larger 3600 mAh battery versus the Pixel XL’s 3450 mAh power plant, but that doesn’t always equate to longer mixed-usage uptime; at least with the current setup of Android 6 Marshmallow on an AT&T GS7 Edge, versus the Pixel XL with Nougat and the same carrier. Android 7 Nougat’s advanced Doze capabilities make an appreciable difference in mainstream usage battery life. If you’re not the type to be on your phone constantly, the Pixel XL offers a significant battery life advantage versus the Galaxy S7 Edge. This could change as Samsung rolls out Android 7 to its Galaxy line, but it’s up to carriers to push via OTA updates as well – which of course AT&T is late to the party with, as usual it seems. That said, I've noticed the Pixel XL survives for nearly two days of mixed use (calls, web browsing, emails, text), in my specific use case. I would consider myself a moderate, but not heavy user. For reference, I generally consume about 3 - 4 Gigs of data per month, though I am on WiFi quite a bit. Also, though I don't use Google Maps a lot, I did leave the High Accuracy location services function on as the Pixel XL noticed my every move from office to restaurants and back home. In short, versus the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge in the same exact use case with my personal usage patterns, the Pixel XL generally survives, again mostly due to Android Nougat Doze features when idle, hours longer on average than what I was realizing on the Galaxy S7 Edge. I wish Google delivered wireless charging with the Pixel XL, but regardless, its battery life prowess offers a significant, tangible gain.

The Phab 2 Pro is the first consumer retail device to support Google Project Tango AR technology, with a multi-camera and sensor array that gives the smartphone the ability to sense and "see" the environment around it, and then map and render virtual augmentations in the environment for the user. The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro is also one of the largest Android smartphones on the market currently, with a ginormous 6.4-inch IPS display and a footprint exceeding 7-inches at its tallest point. Without question, the Phab 2 Pro is every bit a Phablet, if ever there was such a commonly referred to beast.  Equally as notable perhaps, the Phab 2 Pro also represents Lenovo's first commercially available US smartphone, from Lenovo proper, rather than a Moto device from the company's wholly owned subsidiary Motorola Mobility. Moto definitely has its mojo working as of late with excellent, innovative product launches of the Moto Z family with Moto Mods, but can Lenovo flex its muscle in handsets - "for those who do?" If innovation is a key yardstick for you, the Phab 2 Pro's AR skills are certainly a good start. Let's take a closer look...  First, spend a few minutes checking out our hands-on preview, then we'll dive into the particulars, experience, and performance analysis...  Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Specifications & Features Processor 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon Octal-Core 652 1.8GHz Processor GPU Adreno 510 System Memory 4GB Internal storage 64GB Storage Expansion MicroSD - Supports up to 128GB Weight 259 grams (9.14 ounces) Dimensions 179.83mm x 88.57mm x 6.96~10.7mm (7.08 x 3.49 x 0.42 inches) Display 6.4-inch Quad HD (2560X1440) IPS Assertive Display Battery 4050mAh (non-removable), Quick Charge 3.0 Support Rear Cameras 16MP Fast-Focus, Tango Depth Sensor (IR Camera), Tango Motion Tracking (Fisheye Camera) Video 1080p HD video recording at 30 fps, 720p HD video recording at 30 fps, 3-axis electronic image stabilization Front Camera 8 megapixels photos, f/2.2 aperture, 1.4 um Big Pixel Audio Triple Array Microphone with Active Noise-Cancellation, Dolby Atmos + Dolby Audio Capture 5.1 FM Receiver FM Radio Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 4.0 SIM/Ports 2G/3G/4G Nano SIM Card, Nano SIM + TF Card, Micro USB Networks GSM: B2/3/5, UMTS: B1/2/3/4/5, FDD LTE: 2/4/5/7/12/17/20/30 Sensors G-Sensor, P-Sensor, L-Sensor, Accelerator, E-Compass, Gyroscope, Hall Sensor, Ambient Light Sensor, Fingerprint Find The Lenovo Phab 2 Pro At Amazon For $499 Unlocked The specs of the Phab 2 Pro read fairly standard-issue for a current generation flagship Android smartphone. The caveat here is that Lenovo went with a more mid-range Qualcomm processor in the form of the Snapdragon 652. This should play out favorably with respect to battery life, but hold performance back a bit in gaming with its Adreno 510 graphics engine. However, the Snapdragon 652 has also been optimized by Qualcomm for Tango AR application requirements, which in and of themselves tend to be power hungry due to all the sensors and tracking involved.  We'll have to see for ourselves in the benchmarks, but the rest reads like a standard higher-end setup, with 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage and, thankfully, microSD slot expansion, as well as 802.11ac WiFi.   You also get a reasonable well-appointed setup with the Phab 2 Pro with an included AC adapter and micro USB sync and charge cable, along with a set of JBL earbuds that don't sound half-bad. No USB-C available here, but the price is right at $499 unlocked and ready to roll.  Let's get a closer look at industrial design, materials and build quality...

Google Lens is a technology that integrates Google’s search engine with a smartphone’s camera. By taking a photo with Google Lens your camera will be able to recognize objects and search for them on the web. It goes deeper than that though, as CEO Sundar Pichai’s keynote went on some further examples were shown. Another demo Pichai showed off involved connecting to a WiFi network after taking a picture of the name and password. A further search-related example involving taking a picture of a restaurant menu in a foreign language. Google Lens returned both a translated version of the menu and pictures of the dishes. Google Lens can also tap into information from Google My Business and Google Maps. After taking a picture of a restaurant you can see its reviews, hours of operation, contact information, and so on. There was also a demo of how Google Lens would work together with Google Assistant. After taking a picture of the marquee outside a venue, Google Assistant offered help with buying tickets and adding the event to Google Calendar. No timeframe was given as to when Google Lens is expected to launch, but when it does it will not be a standalone app. Pichai said Google Lens would be available through Google Assistant and Google Photos.

The company has managed to cut down the time it takes to render content in half from just a year ago. Google attributes the speed gains to changes such as server-side rendering, and reducing the bandwidth usage from images by 50% without reducing quality. Google is also utilizing a compression algorithm called Brotli to reduce the size of documents by a further 10% in certain browsers. Google took the opportunity during its announcement to highlight some AMP milestones. There are now over 2 billion AMP sites on the web across 900,000 domains. A whopping 340 million of those pages comes from Tumblr, which shared the news that it has that many AMP’d blog posts published across 500,000 domains. Twitter also shared news that it would be expanding support for AMP pages to its Android and iOS app. Currently, AMP URLs can only be shared on Twitter via its mobile web client. There may be an influx of AMP pages in the near future as the AMP network expands to more e-commerce sites. Google is also developing new AMP ads which may attract new publishers, because previously the monetization options for AMP pages was very limited. Whether it’s the expanded support for e-commerce or not, but eBay shared news it would be extending its support for AMP throughout millions more of its pages. The e-commerce giant has already touted published over 15 million AMP pages, now it will be AMP’ing up all its product pages as well as name brand and interest pages. AMP has momentum, and with the continued support of major publishers it’s showing no signs of slowing down. More AMP news may be on the way next week as the company unveils its AMP Project roadmap for the next quarter. We’ll make sure to report on anything of note.

Every few months, a dumb startup will make the news – most recently the one selling a US$700 ($943) juicer – and folks outside the tech industry will begin singing I-told-you-so's. But don't be fooled by expensive juice. The idea that Silicon Valley no longer funds big things isn't just wrong, but also obtuse and fairly dangerous. Look at the cars, the rockets, the internet-beaming balloons and gliders, the voice assistants, drones, augmented and virtual reality devices, and every permutation of artificial intelligence you've ever encountered in sci-fi. Technology companies aren't just funding big things – they are funding the biggest, most world-changing things. They are spending on ideas that, years from now, we may come to see as having altered life for much of the planet. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The tech industry's huge investments in AI might be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government. Photo: NYT At the same time, the US government's appetite for funding big things – for scientific research and out-of-this-world technology and infrastructure programs – keeps falling, and it may decline further under President Donald Trump. This sets up a looming complication: Technology giants, not the government, are building the artificially intelligent future. And unless the government vastly increases how much it spends on research into such technologies, it is the corporations that will decide how to deploy them. Related Content Google's AI wants to get even deeper into our lives Google, Facebook manage internet when it suits Consider Google. On Wednesday, the internet search company kicked off its annual developer conference near its headquarters in Mountain View, California. The company showed off several advances to its voice-enabled assistant and its mobile operating system. Among other things, you can now point your phone at an object in the real world – a flower, a sign in another language, a marquee for a rock concert – and the phone will give you more information about what you're looking at (for instance, a button to buy tickets for the concert). Some of this was cool, but little was truly groundbreaking, which isn't surprising: We're in an awkward phase of the tech industry, one marked by incremental improvements to technologies that we think of as boring – and lots of exciting promises about far-off tech that isn't quite ready for prime time. The real advances at Google are in that second category. At last year's show, Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, inaugurated what he called a new era for Google. The search company would henceforth be an "AI-first" company – that is, most of its advances would be driven by artificial intelligence techniques. Advertisement The technology would play a role in consumer products, like Google's instant translator or its photo app, which can recognise uniquely human search terms (it can find pictures of "hugs," for instance). But AI also informs Google's more ambitious plans. The company is using artificial intelligence to teach computers to understand language, to see and hear, to diagnose diseases, and even to create art. A lot of these plans will fail, but Google isn't making big, long-term bets out of altruism. The company understands that the AI-based projects that succeed could be transformational: They will alter existing industries and create huge new ones, including a stream of new businesses from which Google can profit. Google is not alone in this quest to build a future out of AI. Its parent company, Alphabet, is spending billions to inject machine intelligence into much of the global economy, from self-driving cars to health care. Then there are the other members of the Frightful Five – Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft – which are also spending heavily on the intelligent future. Collectively, the five are among the biggest investors in research and development on the planet. According to their earnings reports, they are on track to spend more than US$60 billion this year on research and development. By comparison, in 2015, the US federal government spent about $67 billion on all nondefense-related scientific research. There are two ways to respond to the tech industry's huge investments in the intelligent future. On the one hand, you could greet the news with optimism and even gratitude. The technologies that Google and other tech giants are working on will have a huge impact on society. Self-driving cars could save tens of thousands of lives a year, for instance, while computerised methods for diagnosing and treating disease could improve our health and cut the cost of care. What's more, experts in the field say that many tech giants are currently approaching AI with a kind of academic ethos. For instance, they regularly publish papers on their findings, and – through their cloud server businesses – they are allowing third-party companies to access some of their latest AI tech. But the tech industry's huge investments in AI might also be cause for alarm, because they are not balanced by anywhere near that level of investment by the government. In the waning days of the Obama administration, the White House published a report examining the ways artificial intelligence would alter the world. The report found that the federal government spent only US$1.1 billion on unclassified AI research in 2015. It argued for increasing spending on artificial intelligence by several times. With greater federal funding, the report said, researchers could focus more on basic research – more tenuous, potentially less immediately applicable areas of AI – and through the grant-making process, the government would have a greater say in how the technology develops. What's interesting is that many in the tech industry agree with the need for greater federal funding. OpenAI was created by Elon Musk, Peter Thiel and other tech luminaries, and it has received funding from Microsoft, Amazon and Y Combinator, the startup incubator. Google also favours federal funding for tech research. In May, Eric Schmidt, Alphabet's executive chairman, was one of the authors of an op-ed in The Washington Post arguing that federal funding of science and technology had created a "miracle machine": a public-private partnership that has churned out dozens of new industries over decades. "If we don't change course and invest in scientific research, we risk losing one of America's greatest advantages," he wrote. In other words, the tech giants that are building the future would like some help changing the world. We would be wise to chip in – or let them take over the future for themselves.

Google, Alexa, Cortana, oh my! It’s been a week full of competing smart-assistant news from Google, Amazon and even Microsoft. Google released its smart assistant as an iOS app, and although the assistant can do some things Siri can’t, co-host Todd Bishop had a hard time getting it to work well for him.  Google also announced new upgrades to its Google Home device, including unlimited free voice calls to any phone in North America, something co-host Andru Edwards is pretty jazzed about. On the other side of the coin, Amazon announced the new Alexa-enabled touchscreen Echo Show, and Alexa Voice Calling, and Microsoft announced big changes to how Windows and Cortana work on Android and iOS devices. We break down all the smart assistant news, including who’s coming out ahead, on this episode of Geared Up. Plus, we take a look at the most recent leaks of the new iPhone 8, including pictures that seem to be a prototype. There’s nothing too earth-shattering in the new news, but it does give us some extra glimpses into Apple’s direction. And we try out the fidget cube and the fidget spinner, two devices designed to calm you down by taking out all your nervous energy. They’re all the rage among kids and adults alike, but Todd and Andru aren’t particularly impressed.

Livemint Photo by iStockphoto/Imaging by Rohit Goyal. The rise of a technology has Bill Gates issuing warnings of an apocalypse. Elon Musk, too. Even Stephen Hawking. What’s worrying these technologists? It’s Artificial Intelligence or AI, an idea whose time has come—it is incubating in science labs and being deployed by start-ups and industrial units alike. Why are Gates and Co. worried? Specifically, it’s over machine learning, an early form of AI that has in recent years become mainstream, causing both delight and nervousness among AI experts and technology companies. AI involves building computers capable of taking smart decisions by themselves, the way humans do. Machine learning and various other sub-fields such as deep learning are the means to achieve AI. Google announced this week that it is rethinking all its products to base them on AI; it has created a new unit called Google.ai to facilitate this shift. The revival of interest in machine learning has been driven by a confluence of factors, such as the massive increase in computing power, emergence of neural networks (connected transistors that replicate the structure of neurons in the human brain) and the easy availability of vast amounts of data, thanks to the Internet. Compared to AI leaders in the Silicon Valley and China, India is a laggard but even here, nearly 300 start-ups are using some form of AI, according to Tracxn, a start-up tracker. Among dedicated AI-only Indian start-ups, 23% are working on providing solutions to multiple industries, 15% are in e-commerce, 12% in healthcare, 11% in education, 10% in financial services, and the rest in fields such as retail and logistics, according to a 2017 report by Kalaari Capital, a venture capital firm. Internet companies tap machine learning techniques for a range of uses—to recommend products for you, for instance, or to predict where cabs should be placed so that when you open your cab-hailing app, there’s one a couple of minutes’ drive away. Healthcare start-ups use AI to help hospitals make speedy and accurate blood reports and medical diagnoses, saving lives. Others get fashion brands and retailers to buy the right quantities of stock. Suddenly, AI is everywhere. Lounge looks at 10 exciting start-ups that are using AI and machine learning techniques to transform healthcare, education, auto and retail. Their success is far from assured. They struggle to find quality talent; they face stiff competition from other AI start-ups; their solutions haven’t yet stood the test of time (most are less than five years old); and they are vulnerable to a variety of other factors that typically bring down start-ups, AI or not. Given the number of AI start-ups, the list is far from comprehensive. Yet the work that these 10 start-ups (and others like them) do is exciting and sometimes cutting-edge, holding out the promise of a significantly improved product or service. How does this work? Traditional code writing entailed programming computers, essentially telling computers what to do. With machine learning, computers are taught to do things themselves. Pedro Domingos, a professor in computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, puts it fittingly in his book, The Master Algorithm: How The Quest For The Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World: “The Industrial Revolution automated manual work and the Information Revolution did the same for mental work, but machine learning automates automation itself.” This is what has people worried—and thrilled. The likes of Gates and Musk fear that machines that learn to think for themselves may become smarter than humans and start taking control of things—the stuff of science fiction. But others such as Domingos believe it will lead to a near-utopian state where people, freed of chores and menial work (now automated), will pursue things that truly excite them. No matter which side of the fence you are on, there’s little doubt that AI represents potentially the most disruptive leap in technology in decades. Apart from disrupting incumbents across businesses, AI may worsen a major socio-economic headache for India: employment. The threat from automation to engineering jobs in Indian IT companies is well documented. But IT is by no means the only business where jobs are at risk. Automation may be a threat to 69% of the jobs in India, according to an October 2016 World Bank report. Even Domingos, who expresses a never-failing belief in the potential of AI to do good for humankind, acknowledges that the technology is likely to make many jobs redundant. Case in point: One of the 10 start-ups we feature replaced its 40-strong content team with a few computer scientists when it adopted machine learning techniques. That represents only a mild threat from AI, especially in a country that is already failing to meet the growing demand for jobs. Investors and experts in AI privately worry about this threat—but they aren’t worried enough yet to look for solutions. That must say something about where their priorities lie—and about the disruption that Artificial Intelligence will cause. —By Mihir Dalal *** Netradyne co-founder Avneesh Agrawal. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint. Netradyne, Bengaluru and San Diego, US Investment: Raised $16 million (around Rs102.8 crore) from Reliance Industries Ltd in June 2016. The team: Founded by Avneesh Agrawal, a former Qualcomm Inc. president for India and South Asia, and David Julian, a former principal engineer at the US-based chip-maker. Intelligence factor: Netradyne’s Driveri, a powerful camera that analyses driving patterns and can help determine the cause of an accident. The soap-bar-sized device is attached to a vehicle’s rear-view mirror and rests on the inside of the windscreen, pointing towards the road. In July 2015, Agrawal, along with his long-time friend and colleague Julian, set up Netradyne, wanting to tackle that intractable problem of the modern world—road accidents. Netradyne’s main product is Driveri, which packs in four high-definition cameras generating 360-degree footage of the vehicle’s path (transmitted on a real-time LTE network), has a global positioning system, gyroscope sensors and accelerometer, and a Nvidia processor, the same one that is used in the iPhone 5. The unit captures visuals of the car’s surroundings, analyses driving patterns and stores the data on a cloud platform. It uses machine learning and deep-learning systems to analyse the entire scene in front of the car: traffic lights, stop signs, objects in its course, distance to every other vehicle, relative speeds and direction. The data generated enables the platform to determine whether the driver is overspeeding or driving rashly, adhering to traffic rules, is potentially drowsy or drunk, or taking multiple halts along the route. In the event of an accident, it also sends real-time alerts to the fleet operator. According to Agrawal, similar technology is used to power autonomous car projects across the world, such as those being developed by Google (Alphabet Inc.), Uber Inc., Robert Bosch GmbH and large car-makers like Toyota, Volkswagen Group and Daimler AG. After testing the product for over 750,000 miles (around 1.2 million kilometres), Netradyne launched Driveri in the US market in March and plans to launch it in India by June-July. It recently signed its first US client, Load One, a mid-sized cargo company that operates a fleet of 350 trucks. The solution is also useful for retail customers like parents of first-time teenage drivers. Agrawal says Netradyne’s main focus currently is to ensure driver safety. The product is being marketed to commercial fleet operators to enable them to monitor drivers and enhance the safety of cargo. “Using the solution, fleet managers can train drivers on safe driving practices, besides maintaining a close check on valuable cargo.... They can also create a scorecard for drivers and incentivize them on safe driving,” says Agrawal. Agrawal, whose company employs around 60 people, expects Driveri customers to see a significant reduction in the number of traffic violations and accidents; in turn, safer driving would result in greater fuel efficiency and lower maintenance costs. The other big market is insurance. “What we are essentially doing is quantifying risk,” Agrawal says. His plan is to bring Driveri to every car in the world with insurance partners who agree to use its data for investigating accidents and deciding on a more accurate premium amount. —By Yuvraj Malik Embibe founder Aditi Avasthi Embibe, Bengaluru Investment: $9 million from venture capital investors such as Kalaari Capital and Lightbox. The team: Founded by Aditi Avasthi, a former Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Barclays executive. Intelligence factor: In a country where the overall quality of education consistently lags behind those in developed nations, Embibe’s core AI product can be a game changer. In the book (and movie) Moneyball, a baseball coach and an economics graduate from Harvard use an analytics engine to ditch decades of baseball practice and identify a world-class team that ends up breaking numerous Major League Baseball records. Major teams end up adopting the model. Embibe is hoping to create a similar impact in the world of education. Its learning platform is being used by thousands of students and the start-up is in talks to ally with educational training centres. Embibe, which runs a website and a mobile app, collects data from students, charging only for advanced analysis and personalized learning recommendations. Students can actually improve test scores by fixing basic mistakes using its AI platform. For instance, Embibe’s First Look Accuracy metric trains students to maximize scores in a given test by first answering the questions they can attempt confidently and then moving on to the tougher ones. Another metric, “‘Time Spent On Questions Not Answered’, indicates no confidence, an inability to know what you know yourself. You’re unsure of your ability. This value is actually 41 minutes for Indian kids for the IIT exams out of 180 minutes—in an exam where 1 mark is almost equivalent to 10,000 ranks. So, think about it—if you’re able to bring this value down by 50%, the scores automatically trend up,” explains Avasthi. The company says it has identified 27 parameters that can, for instance, predict scores in an IIT entrance exam with 93% accuracy. To get the bulk of data that its core cloud-based platform crunches, the start-up bought 100Marks, another ed-tech start-up, in 2015. Embibe uses advanced-level analytics besides its core AI engine, including self-learning algorithms, machine learning and cognitive computing akin to IBM’s Watson. It started out as an analytics company in 2012 and began using AI and machine learning tools in 2014 in an effort to create personalized solutions for individual students. Embibe started with a 40-member team that was primarily responsible for content creation; now it’s down to just three. The cost of creating content is down “from the high hundreds to Rs20 per unit of content through automation,” says Avasthi, who has hired three machine learning and AI experts from top companies, including IBM. —By Anirban Sen Tricog Health Services co-founder Charit Bhograj. Tricog Health Services PVT. LTD, Bengaluru Investment: $2 million from Inventus Capital Partners, Blume Ventures and angel investors. The team: Charit Bhograj, a cardiologist; Zainul Charbiwala, who worked at IBM India and Qualcomm; Udayan Dasgupta, who worked at Texas Instruments; and Abhinav Gujjar, who worked at Thomson Reuters and Microsoft. Intelligence factor: What can take up to 6 hours before treatment starts, Tricog accomplishes in a few minutes. Nearly 7.5 million people die every year of heart disease. Around 1.5-3 million of them are in India; half of them can be saved by early diagnosis, according to Bhograj. “Yet almost 70% of the general physicians do not have an ECG (electrocardiography) machine,” he adds. ECG—a heart health test—is conducted through a machine which records the heart’s electrical movement. These machines are not widely available in India, nor are there enough cardiologists to interpret ECG data. And it can take up to 6 hours before a patient is diagnosed and sent for treatment, says Bhograj. So Tricog set out to help doctors make instant diagnoses of heart attacks and ensure treatment is not delayed. While Tricog sources ECG machines from General Electric Healthcare, it has built its own sensory device and fits it on the machines. It gives these devices to general physicians, clinics and nursing homes on a subscription basis. Through the Internet, this device sends the ECG or recorded heart movement to a set of algorithms, which then generates a report. Before the report is sent, a specialist doctor verifies it. In 2016, Tricog processed the ECG reports of 200,000 patients; about 11,000 of them were diagnosed with a heart attack. The company claims it has never reported false results. Yet, given the stakes, Bhograj reasons that “no matter how accurate the algorithm gets, there will always be a specialist (cardiologist) to verify the report churned out by it.” Founded in 2011, the company spent close to four years putting the technology together and launched the product in February 2015. As of April, Tricog had 600 clients (general physicians, clinics and nursing homes) across 178 cities and towns, and 20 specialist doctors, including clinical cardiologists, who study the reports. In the next five years, Tricog aims to be present in 100,000 locations—it claims that though such a scale would ordinarily require around 700 doctors, it would be able to deliver comparable service with only 50 doctors. —By Arushi Chopra Arya.ai, Mumbai Arya.ai’s co-founder Vinay Kumar Sankarapu. Photo: Aniruddha Chowdhury/Mint. Investment: An undisclosed amount from YourNest Angel Fund and VentureNursery. the team: Vinay Kumar Sankarapu, chief executive officer, and Deekshith Marla, chief technology officer. Intelligence factor: Many start-ups are working with AI to solve problems in banking and insurance. Arya.ai tells them how to. Last year, world champion Lee Sedol was pitted against AlphaGo, a computer program made by Google, in a game of Go, an abstract board game. All AlphaGo needed to be told was the desired result. It figured out the rest for itself. Sankarapu, seated in his office in Mumbai’s Andheri area, says the day isn’t far when a business firm will be able to apply AI for similar results. His company, Arya.ai, is taking steps towards this; it is helping build AI that “becomes more intelligent the more it is used. The next generation of AI will be built by AI,” he says. Many start-ups in India are working with deep learning, which aims to make human effort minimal. Arya.ai works as an “enabler”. For instance, if a consultancy firm is building AI for its investment banking client, Arya.ai will provide the firm with the tools to build it, creating the “neural network”—a vast computing system that mimics the human brain; it will create a cloud system which will allow the AI to evolve, learn from its earlier tasks and apply them to the next one. “Basically, we help build a complicated system really fast, help you automate a lot of stuff. An algorithm may take months to build. We could actually help you build a complete system in weeks,” he says. Arya.ai also has direct clients, such as banks or insurance companies, where cases of fraud claims and bad loans can be identified with precision. The change is already visible: the phone call you get from your bank when an irregularity in your transaction pattern is registered is courtesy its AI-enabled system. This is the result of the data fed into it, based on geographical location and your records of the past 30 days. But as hackers get sharper—making low-key transactions over a long period of time after carefully observing the customer’s banking habits—deep learning will take it to the next level, with greater accuracy. Currently, Arya.ai is engaged with one of the world’s biggest consultancy firms, New York and London-based banks, global insurance companies and leading manufacturing firms. Their work is mostly at the business-to-business level but the effects, says Sankarapu, will also be felt by the man on the street. “Things will become super-fast, personalized and cost-efficient for the end consumer,” says Sankarapu, who grew up in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district and now shuttles between Mumbai and San Francisco. In 2015, Arya.ai was chosen as one of the 21 most innovative start-ups by Paris&Co, a French innovation agency. Arya.ai started out as a way of making the lives of researchers easier in 2013, at a time when Sankarapu was studying at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. If there were 200,000 books on a particular subject, it was not humanly possible to read them all; Sankarapu was trying to build AI that would absorb as much information as these books would hold in less time than the human brain ever could. “I soon understood that the bigger problem is not building a solution but enabling it. Everyone wants to use deep learning, but they don’t know how to use it,” he says. Sankarapu is a Marvel fan but he’s never had any romantic notions about AI. He says that like any new, exciting technology that comes every decade or so, AI has been hyped beyond its capabilities. To him, it is a formula, one which is more exciting than fantasy. “When you start understanding how to build it, you start understanding what we are made of. The human brain is nothing but a simple mathematical computer.” —Sankhayan Ghosh Locus.sh’s founders Geet Garg (left) and Nishith Rastogi. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Locus.sh (Mara Labs INC.), Bengaluru and US Investment: At least $2.75 million from Exfinity Venture Partners, Blume Ventures, BeeNext and others. The team: Nishith Rastogi, who has worked with Amazon and eBay; and Geet Garg, who was with Amazon. The two had co-founded PinChat, a location-based conversational platform, in August 2014. Intelligence factor: Locus has developed route-planning algorithms so companies can chart the best possible route to deliver an order and allow a salesperson to cover the maximum number of points in the shortest time possible. Locus aims to automate all the human decisions involved in sending a package. With clients such as Hindustan Unilever, Quikr, Urban Ladder and Lenskart, it has a lot on its hands. The company, which says it has more than 25 clients, has developed a route-planning engine, its core business, apart from a 3D packing engine that provides configurations for loading cargo into containers. Locus also offers companies a weekly schedule of the most efficient routes and outlets for their sales teams. Rastogi says each schedule planned by their routing engine takes 5-10 minutes, whereas a skilled human being would take 1-4 hours to process the same data. The company says it helps its clients reduce their logistics costs by at least 25%. Locus offers solutions for both intracity and intercity operations. It estimates the domestic freight industry is around $100 billion; a bulk of this is intercity logistics. Planning the best possible route is not as easy as it sounds. “In many cases, we will have a landmark and street name with a wrong pin code. We have to convert this information into latitude and longitude. For this, our systems need to understand and interpret the English language and build natural language processing systems,” says Rastogi. “Let us say you have to deliver a package before hitting the gym at 6pm. But if you reach the gym 5 minutes late, that is also fine. How do I make the system understand that it is better to reach the gym by 6.05pm instead of not delivering the package at all? In the real world, if a truck is full, the driver can keep one package next to his seat. It is important in the real world to understand what that soft threshold is. It is important for the system to understand this world fuzziness,” explains Rastogi. Companies provide Locus the origin of the package, destination and expected time of delivery. Locus sources all the possible routes from Google Maps or sifts through data on past deliveries. This data is then processed, factoring in weather information, traffic, historical data on time taken to cover the distance, etc. to arrive at a few best routes. If the client is new, logistics solutions take about three months. Are the companies willing to wait? “We haven’t lost a single client yet,” says Rastogi. —By Sayan Chakraborty Mad Street Den’s co-founder Ashwini Asokan. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Mad Street Den, Chennai Investment: $1.5 million from Exfinity Ventures and growX Ventures, in addition to an undisclosed sum from Sequoia Capital. The team: The husband-wife duo of Ashwini Asokan and Anand Chandrasekaran. Asokan, who previously worked for Intel Corp., and her husband Anand Chandrasekaran, a neuroscientist, who is the firm’s chief technology officer, both worked in the US before deciding to return to India in 2013. Intelligence factor: One of the several AI start-ups trying to improve the retail experience in India. Asokan, among a handful of people in India who speak openly about the skewed gender representation in the start-up business, runs Mad Street Den, a start-up that is trying to make the business of retail more efficient. The start-up’s main product, Vue.ai, offers visual search technology, product recommendations, and personalized home pages based on the tastes of individual shoppers, among other features. The AI-based technology offers several benefits to customers: uploading pictures and finding matching products, browsing in a way that is specifically tailored to their tastes, discovering products they may otherwise not have been aware of, and reducing the amount of time they spend shopping or having a more efficient shopping experience. As the customer experience improves, it results in better conversion rates for retailers. Vue.ai also helps retailers reduce cataloguing errors and product returns and make merchandising more customer-friendly. The company also hopes to turn omni-channel retail, so far a pipe dream, into reality. Mad Street Den currently works with firms such as furniture e-commerce site HipVan in Singapore and fashion e-tailers such as TataCliq, Craftsvilla and Voonik in India. The Chennai-based company is one of the tens of start-ups selling efficiency-improvement tech to retailers. Others, such as Stylumia, Staqu and SnapShopr, offer similar services. Mad Street Den, however, is expanding into gaming and other businesses this year. “Scale markets globally, scale our AI systems and establish ourselves as the first computer vision business that’s making money on scale,” says Asokan. She sounds the part of a change-the-world entrepreneur. “To build generalizable AI is one of the founding principles of why we started this. The second part of the founding principle is making AI accessible to millions of people across the globe. Not just to build it, but actually to build it on the scale that applies to people across the world. The first one represents Anand’s vision, the second one represents why I am here,” says Asokan. —By Sadhana Chathurvedula Niki.ai’s founders (from left) Sachin Jaiswal, Nitin Babel, Keshav Prawasi and Shishir Modi.

LTD), Bengaluru Investment: Niki.ai raised undisclosed seed investments from Ronnie Screwvala’s Unilazer Ventures, Tata Sons chairman emeritus Ratan Tata and Haresh Chawla of True North between October 2015 and December 2016. Niki.ai declined to disclose the quantum of funds raised. The team: Founded by four Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, alumni. Before starting the venture, Sachin Jaiswal, chief executive officer at Niki.ai, had co-founded InnovAccer Inc., a healthcare analytics company in the US. Technology head Keshav Prawasi was a software engineer at Amazon; Nitin Babel, who looks after support and marketing, worked for Ipsos, a global market and opinion research firm; and business head Shishir Modi came from a stint at a multinational energy distribution company. Intelligence factor: Niki is used for over 20 services, including hotel, cab and movie ticket bookings, ordering food and paying bills. If you’re rude, it will reprimand you and can even block you. Chatbots—like Apple’s Siri and Google’s Allo—are essentially computer programs that make human-like conversation with users. Banks, retailers and others use chatbots to answer basic customer queries and help users navigate their websites. Niki, one of the early chatbots developed in India, is designed to serve as a virtual shopkeeper that assists in the purchase of products and services. It can help you book a cab, order food from the nearest restaurant, book tickets for movies and events, and pay general utility bills. Flight bookings, payments for insurance and courier services will be introduced soon. Niki was conceived in early 2015 and rolled out to customers in October that year. It works on a series of sophisticated algorithms that understand human language by breaking it down into structured queries that the machine can understand. Another set of codes then generates a response relevant to the query, and this goes on till the task is accomplished. The core of the platform rests on language-recognition systems. “We started with off-the-shelf solutions like Stanford CoreNLP and went on to develop our own custom models,” says Babel. These were developed by studying the interactions on Niki and constantly tweaking algorithms to accurately determine what the user is looking for. Currently, Niki has over 300,000 users; 50-60% of them are in the age group of 24-35, 20-30% in the 18-24 age group, and about 10% are over 35. “We have been collecting the conversational commerce data for Indian customers for the last two years. Close to 50 million interactions have happened on Niki and have been used to improve the accuracy from 50-60% to 90%,” says Babel. He says the company earns revenue by charging a commission on each service or product purchased on Niki. Earlier this year, the company launched a software development kit that allows other sites and apps to integrate Niki with their platforms. It is available on HDFC Bank’s OnChat, the Oxigen Wallet app and the operating system of Intex smartphones (as the LFTY feature). The company will launch 20 more partnerships soon. — By Yuvraj Malik Zenatix’s co-founders (seated in front, from left) Amarjeet Singh and Vishal Bansal.

LTD, Gurugram Investment: Rs11.5 crore from pi Ventures, Blume Ventures, Rahul Khanna, managing partner, Trifecta Capital, Rajan Anandan, vice-president and managing director of Google, South-East Asia and India, and Snapdeal co-founders Kunal Bahl and Rohit Bansal. The team: Vishal Bansal, who worked as portfolio manager at ING Insurance; Rahul Bhalla, who worked in the legal outsourcing industry; and Amarjeet Singh, who worked as an assistant professor at the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi. Intelligence factor: Zenatix helps businesses save energy and cut down their electricity bills. Zenatix, a team of 35, works with large chains of quick-service restaurants (QSRs), bank ATMs and retail stores which have anywhere from 200 to more than 1,000 stores/outlets. A Zenatix client that has around 1,000 stores, each 2,500 sq. ft in area, used to spend Rs80-100 crore annually on electricity. Zenatix helps it save 10-30% of this amount. All these outlets have electrical assets such as ATM machines, air conditioners, and ovens and exhaust fans in the case of QSR kitchens. When it comes to ACs in a workplace, someone would generally switch them on at the start of the day and switch them off at the close of day. “The person is not equipped with the intelligence that, based on the occupancy of the space, temperature outside and even time of day, the usage of AC can be optimized. Or consider, if an ATM breaks down, it could take a few hours to days (depending on where it is located) to get it fixed,” says Bansal. “If we know that a grocery store or an ATM sees a minimum footfall during certain hours of a day, one set of ACs may be switched off to maintain the same ambient temperature inside,” he adds. Through its WattMan device, Zenatix captures data points such as the time of day, electricity consumed, and outside temperature, every 30 seconds. Based on this, it can reboot an ATM when it stops working, predict when an AC in a retail store will break down or needs servicing, and automate its switching on and off. Zenatix plans to double WattMan’s presence to 1,000 sites by June, as its existing clientele of over 20 companies hands over more stores/outlets to Zenatix. As of April, it had installed WattMan at 500 sites. Zenatix wants to build accurate computing and predictive models. “Imagine if a door to cold storage is left open, and as soon as it reflects a change of temperature, the door closes automatically. That’s the kind of advanced temperature profiling we want to build.... We want that when an air conditioner is not working properly, the correlation between temperature and electricity can tell us whether it is the gas, filter or compressor causing the problem,” says Bansal. — By Arushi Chopra Active.ai’s co-founder Ravi Shankar. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Active.ai (Active Intelligence PTE LTD), Bengaluru and Singapore Investment: $3.5 million (around Rs22.5 crore) from Kalaari Capital and IDG Ventures India. The team: Ravi Shankar, chief executive officer and co-founder, has worked with banks such as HDFC Bank, ABN AMRO and YES Bank; Shankar Narayanan, the chief operating officer, founded the start-ups Fastacash and Cazh and co-founded Tagit; Parikshit Paspulati, chief technology officer, founded Finoculus and co-founded Tagit. Narayanan and Paspulati are Singapore-based, where the company is headquartered; more than half the workforce is based in Bengaluru. Intelligence factor: Let’s say, you need to know your account balance and don’t really have the time to walk into an ATM or even look into the bank’s app. Send a message to the bank through Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp and you will get the reply. Chances are high that your bank is using Active.ai platform, an intelligent interface that allows banks and consumers to connect over chat. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Shankar, Narayanan and Paspulati have all worked with banks and fintech start-ups. Perhaps naturally then, Active.ai wants to improve customer engagement for banks and insurance companies. “Say you type, I lost my wallet. What will the bank understand? There is no transaction for ‘lost my wallet’. The system will understand that it means all the cards are gone. The bank will say I will block your card,” says Shankar. “Now, let’s say you are at an airport. The bank will say, ‘Looks like you are at an airport and travelling. Can we help you with a (travel) insurance policy?’ The ability to hold this conversation is what we bring to banks.” According to Shankar, Active.ai will help banks almost halve their customer engagement costs. Active.ai essentially offers a platform that has chatbots through which banks can interact with customers. The more customers interact, the more the Artificial Intelligence behind Active.ai’s platform will learn about them and the better it will be able to offer personalized advice and service, increasing customer engagement and loyalty. Usage for consumers can range from opening an account and getting balance information, to transferring money to other accounts or paying bills. Banks, on the other hand, can push relevant products and services, drawing on the data available on customer history. The bot can be integrated via various channels, including WeChat, LINE, Kakao Talk, Facebook Messenger, Amazon Echo and Siri. Largely, the company sources data from banks and other partner financial institutions, apart from Envestnet | Yodlee, a data aggregation and analytics platform. Active.ai has developed algorithms that can convert unstructured messages, i.e. input by consumers, into structured instructions for banks using natural language processing and machine learning. “Say you are typing on Facebook. This is unstructured messaging. We convert that into entities and intent. For instance, you type, ‘I want to know what is happening in my account.’ Here, entity is the account and intent is ‘I want to know’. Our algorithm captures this and it then figures out the context. That is the third component. So the system will think this guy has an account and wants to know what is happening there, I should get his balance,” explains Shankar. In India, the company counts Axis Bank as a client; deals with several others are in the pipeline. It says it has already signed up with banks in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Discussions with banks in North America are under way, says Shankar. “Apart from reducing the costs of customer engagement, banks can cross-sell or upsell. It helps them retain customers with higher engagement and client service levels. It also helps banks reach out to new consumers, especially the youth, via chat,” he adds. Having started with the banking sector, Active.ai now plans to work with insurance companies to boost customer engagement. —By Sayan Chakraborty SigTuple’s founding team (from left) Tathagato Rai Dastidar, Rohit Kumar Pandey and Apurv Anand. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint Sigtuple, Bengaluru Investment: $6.4 million, from investors such as Accel Partners, Axilor Ventures, IDG Ventures, pi Ventures, Endiya Partners, VH Capital and Flipkart founders Sachin and Binny Bansal. The team: Started by former American Express executives Rohit Kumar Pandey, Tathagato Rai Dastidar and Apurv Anand. Intelligence factor: SigTuple is helping hospitals and healthcare centres improve the speed and accuracy of blood reports. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint In medicine and healthcare, accuracy and time are important factors. A delay of even half an hour can result in loss of life; and a wrong diagnosis could prove tragic. SigTuple is looking to address both these issues through its AI-powered Manthana platform, which can, among other things, analyse blood samples and generate medical reports in less than 10 minutes—and with complete accuracy, according to Pandey, who is also the chief executive officer. “From the moment someone reaches the labs and provides a blood sample, the total time taken for the generation of a report and review by a pathologist is less than 10 minutes,” says Pandey. Manthana is being used by a number of mid- to large-sized hospitals, diagnostics labs, and eyecare and healthcare chains. Among their prominent clients is Anand Diagnostic Labs, one of Bengaluru’s biggest chains, which uses one of SigTuple’s digitization tools to analyse blood samples. Now the team is working towards making Manthana available for a complete diagnosis. Photo: Hemant Mishra/Mint At present, Manthana can analyse blood, semen and urine samples—Pandey says the platform is capable of generating complete blood reports, which typically analyse 21 different parameters, including red and white blood cell count and platelets. For example, SigTuple has used the AI-powered platform to analyse a blood sample to catch a malarial parasite, says Pandey. Accuracy is another area that the team hopes to improve on—currently, SigTuple’s accuracy rates differ for different solutions. For instance, accuracy rates for urine samples stand at around 85-88%. For SigTuple, evolving from traditional analytics to machine learning was a crucial pivot, since it wanted to create tools that could analyse medical cases, just like a doctor would. “Earlier, the algorithms that were being used, as soon as they saw new data, the results used to get skewed. With the advancement of AI, as more and more new data keeps coming in, the machine continues to learn—like humans. And it starts generating solutions, which was not possible with traditional algorithms,” says Pandey. The limitations of traditional algorithms were addressed by machine learning, where a machine is trained to mimic a human brain—somewhat like IBM’s Watson. For example, a hospital chain which wants to open a lab in a tier-II or tier-III city usually has to spend hundreds of crores of rupees on hardware, equipment and medical experts. With SigTuple’s platforms such as Manthana, hospitals can scale up in smaller cities and towns. Since it also eliminates the need for labs to ship blood samples to different locations, it helps diagnostic chains save on logistical costs and, more crucially, time. “There is no need for a manual review by a pathologist by putting a slide under a microscope. Second, remote diagnosis is made possible, because the pathologist need not be sitting next to the microscope or blood slide. No shipping is required—the pathologist can be anywhere,” says Pandey. SigTuple gets most of its data from the labs and hospitals that it works with. Over the next year, a top priority for the company is to gather more data through more such partnerships to improve the accuracy of Manthana. —By Anirban Sen Livemint Topics: India AI Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning start-ups More From Livemint READ MORE Oil ministry may block PSUs buying GDF International’s 10% stake in Petronet LNG LG to bring premium ‘LG Signature’ brand to India in July KEC International bags orders worth Rs945 crore First Published: Sat, May 20 2017. 08 58 AM IST Editor's Picks 10 standout start-ups taking an AI leap in India Do SBI’s fourth quarter results indicate a turnaround in economy?

Some Pixel owners are experiencing random software freezes Michael Crider Follow View All Posts 2016/12/23 4:30pm PDTDec 23, 2016 87 Plus 1 on G+ 199 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares391 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Google's trying to market the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones as premium, market-leading devices, and a big part of that is nailing the software experience. Alas, quite a few owners of Google's first-party phones aren't feeling particularly premium as of late: this lengthy discussion on Google's product forum documents a series of as-yet-unexplained software freezes and lockups. Commonalities among the users seem to be a complete freeze of the interface that lasts several seconds to several minutes, including disappearing navigation buttons. Google's support team is aware of the problem and replying to at least some direct support requests, but replies in the forum thread are somewhat few and far between. Early responses seemed to indicate that a third-party app, Life360's family locator, was the source of the issue. And indeed, quite a few users of the app have eliminated the problem by disabling or uninstalling the app - though that's hardly ideal, since many of them considered it essential for keeping a handle on kids or other family members. But others are experiencing the same debilitating freezes without ever having installed that particular app, so it seems that whatever the software problem is, there are multiple ways to encounter it. A frozen screenshot from forum poster Triangles - note the blank Home and Recents buttons. Pixel and Pixel XL owners are having the same problem, which might indicate a common hardware-software issue. While it's not so widespread that it appears to be happening to all Pixel phones, it looks like a few hundred owners are seeing it at the very least. Aside from that specific Life360 app (and perhaps disabling location services, also less than ideal), there doesn't appear to be a reliable way to solve the problem at the time of writing. Drop into the thread if you're experiencing it, or contact Google's Pixel support directly.  Source: Google Product forums Thanks: Jonny Tags bugs freeze frozen Google hang pixel pixel xl support subscribe ...

I blamed it on the poor LTE signal. I can't uninstall it I wouldn't know who I am :) I was trying to re-signing into an app that relies heavily on location - SpeedPass+. Marcelove "wouldn't know who I am" Lol 😂 +1 Joe Mihalich Thanks for publishing this story. I would be willing to bet at this point that there are thousands of people having this issue, but writing it off to a blip or whatever because it may be happening infrequently to them. Bas Keetelaar Well, let's hope Google doesn't take the Nexus 9 approach. HiroRoshi The irony is that CM14.1 and unofficial Nougat ports are more stable on older devices. FeelThePoveR It's not irony, it's just the developers know more about older devices, are more accustomed to them and probably developed some of their own stuff for it (i.e. new audio hal for my old M7). MicroNix But, but, but Google designed the Pixel and own the software FeelThePoveR But... There were some rumors that the pixels were kinda rushed (and it would explain i.e. lens flare issue or lack of waterproofing) so... that could count as an excuse (not a good one but still) LoL :P MicroNix Kinda reaching there ;) likurges no excuse for the price, if it was rushed the price should be lower, otherwise there shouldn't be problems like these. and don't start with "every premium phone has issues" because it's inexcusable for ANY phone in this price range to have stupid problems like this Pinga_dulce I don't care if the phone cost $150. At that price range I don't expect premium built, bells and whistles. However, whatever it offers, better work flawlessly. I get tired of people making excuses for these OEMS, as if the offerings are for free. You buy a Corrolla, it may not have the horse power, BT, or leather seat, but there is a performance expectation. navjack Tell that to my Moto g 1st gen on republic wireless. Oh god it's horrible. Zero memory management. Constant issues just doing normal system processes. 5723alex . CM is dead: Cyanogen services shutting down As part of the ongoing consolidation of Cyanogen, all services and Cyanogen-supported nightly builds will be discontinued no later than 12/31/16. The open source project and source code will remain available for anyone who wants to build CyanogenMod personally. Peter Silie Which would be? Bas Keetelaar Doing nothing actually. Nexus 9 has this problem where it would crash and show a white screen and sometimes it makes a loud noise as well. Google barely acknowledges this problem (maybe b/c it's a hardware problem) Michael Hannigan Never had it on my Nexus 9s. Probably an isolated problem. Those are meaningless dcdttu Uninstalled Life 360, problem solved. Told them weeks ago. Syukri Lajin That is a workaround, the problem is not solved. Apps shouldn't cause a reboot(unintentionally), the problem is in the operating system not the app. dcdttu Dear Vulcan, Hi. It's a figure of speech. Love Life360 and wish they'd fix it. Android User Michael Hannigan Sounds more like the problem is with the app. Your reasoning seems a bit odd. It's one app causing the problem. Syukri Lajin It's a simple logic actually. When a broken radio inside your car cause the whole engine stops running in the middle of the road, you fix the engine not to allow it to happen again, not just the radio. I'm not saying the app isn't problematic, but the operating system should not have crashed together with the app. vzwuser76 If the radio is causing the engine to do, fixing the engine has nothing to do with it. If it's say a short to ground that's drawing down the electrical system, you find the short and eliminate it. The engine most likely would have nothing to do with it. Sure you could put a beefier electrical system in there, but a short would still take the engine down, I might just take longer to do so. Or it might damage something else like the alternator. The point is, sometimes a little thing can take down sparge thing. In this case, if an improperly coded app is causing the issue, you could probably modify the OS the allow it to work. But if there are only 1 or 2 apps that are coded incorrectly then why modify the OS for them if all the other apps function correctly? You go to the source of the problem and fix that. How do I know this? Because I'm an electronics technician and spent 12 years troubleshooting electronic issues. If you don't find the source of the issue and repair it, or modify non-issue complements to try and fix the problem, you may end up with more issues than you started with. Syukri Lajin the problem is inside the operating system, not just the app. What should happen is android would detect that the app is not responding and shows the App not responding dialog. The operating system should not crash together with it. vzwuser76 And you know the problem is inside the OS for certain? Then why don't you fix it? If the app is sending data, a request, or a query the OS doesn't recognize, it might cause it to have a problem if the OS is trying to implement the command from the app but can't because it doesn't recognize it. Or it could be something else entirely causing the issue. But first things first. You find the root cause of the issue. If it's an app, it's up to the developer to determine why their app is causing the issue. And because so few phones are affected by the issue, that leans more to it being less about the OS and more about it being one or a handful of apps. Sure you can modify the OS to handle the problem better, but if the issue is with the app, and if it would've been coded properly in the first place, the issue would never have presented itself. And even if you fix this issue with the app and then modify the OS to compensate, what happens when a different issue occurs due to a different poorly coded app? Modify the OS again? Keep that up and the modifications made to the OS could negatively affect other apps that weren't affected previously. When troubleshooting an issue, you try to make as small of a change as possible as to not affect another part of the system that IS running properly. I've seen it happen before where someone decides to make a widespread change and while it fixes the original issue, now they have multiple new issues. One step forward, five steps back. There's an old saying, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Syukri Lajin You seems to know a lot about the problem. Why don't you solve it? vzwuser76 I listed POSSIBLE causes and basic troubleshooting techniques. I've listed why I know something about how you go about troubleshooting an issue, what do you do that qualifies your statements? Syukri Lajin How can i argue with an engineer with 12 years of experience that seems to know everything. :D vzwuser76 You didn't answer the question. Btw I'm a technician, not an engineer. Engineers design the system, I fix them when something goes wrong. But maybe I should just talk out of my ass and hope for the best, seems to work for you. Syukri Lajin I don't argue with someone that have had his mind set. It's pointless. :D vzwuser76 What mindset? That they have experience with issues such as this? But if I'm wrong and you have more experience than I do, say so and I will gladly defer to you. Syukri Lajin I should stop now. Nothing is more of waste of time than arguing to prove that the other person is wrong. :D vzwuser76 Then prove it. If I'm wrong then back up what you're saying. MicroNix Your logic here is incorrect. If the radio causes the engine to die, then there's a problem with the infrastructure allowing that to occur as well as a problem with the radio. The radio should be on a proper fuse that should blow before taking down the engine's electrical. I'm sure there should be a way for an OS to have safeguards like that as well, but I don't build operating systems and don't pretend to. Max If a radio is *so* broken it manages to take down my whole engine, you can bet your can of tuna I'm taking that thing out of my car. Yes, it'd be nice if the engine shrugged off anything the radio could do to it, but if *all* the other car parts have no effect on the engine, I'm blaming the offending app more. Michael Hannigan It depends. If you run 240V AC backwards down those wires, you might have issues with that car. If you put water in the gas tank, well, "no va". Syukri Lajin too bad stupidity can't be fixed. not much anyone can do about that kind of problems. :D Michael Hannigan I know - you are destined to be stupid for a lifetime. How I pity thee. navjack I put water in my tank all the time in order to build an immunity Michael Hannigan BTW, I've seen plenty of faulty alarm systems drain a car battery and leave the car unusable. Fault - car or alarm?? Phil Kulak If an app can take down the OS, the problem is with the OS and maybe the app. This isn't 1995 anymore when a single crappy executable can bring on a BSOD. vzwuser76 Really, because wasn't there a story just this year where typing in a particular phrase in a text message or something similar and it caused the system to crash? Ajay Shah And Apple patched that bug in iOS, because it's a fault of the OS, nothing else. vzwuser76 I never said that wasn't an OS issue. I was really being to someone who said a single executable couldn't bring down an OS anymore. That was a separate comment from the discussion about if the issue was the app or the OS. Michael Hannigan When it's a single poorly coded app, then it is a problem with the app. The real and only problem here is quality control with what is released in the app store. Phil Kulak No. I don't think you really understand the design goals of a modern OS. Michael Hannigan Teach me, Phil. Phil Kulak Sure! Well, I'm not going to write a book just for you, but go ahead and start reading here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_space Michael Hannigan I will only bieve what comes directly from you, Phil. Wikipedia doesn't cut it. Artem Russakovskii Some people said that they didn't have Life 360 installed. Michael Hannigan Those people are lying. thecatch33 You, sir, must have been the anchor of your debate team. abc Oh really? I see the problem now - you're a fucking idiot. Michael Hannigan Your comment is invalid. I am actually a genius. dcdttu I'm sure there are a myriad of reasons why millions of phones could have issues. I'm also certain Life360 was my particular issue. No reboots in 2 weeks without it. vzwuser76 So maybe another app has the same issue? And from reading this story on another site, the amount of affected users is anywhere from less than a hundred to a few hundred, in other words not that many. So the most logical way to narrow it down would be to have users who don't have the Life360 app installed compare apps they do have installed and see if there is a common app(s) installed and see if uninstalling them solves the issue. If it does, the next step would be to have the developers of those apps look into the matter and see if they can find a common thread that may be causing the issue. Zsolt V Or it's simply some people with agendas? Just add the likely. abc People with agendas like you? Just adding to your fact free argument. thecatch33 I have a Pixel XL with no Life360 and it has locked up on me multiple times. I wasn't aware that I had any agenda other than wanting my phone to stop freezing. Zsolt V Yup, I believe everything I read on the internet, because there are no people around with agendas. dcdttu Just a friendly update: I've uninstalled Life360 for 1 week now and it's not locked up / rebooted once. This is on 2 different Pixels, btw. It's totally Life360 doing it to me, not sure what the other users issue is but it's a big cellular world out there so it could be anything. master94 If you wants a true nexus like experience with minimum bugs you should honestly just buy w/e OnePlus is making. Pixel is very beta like and probably better for people who don't mind bugs. Bob Marley That's a very bold statement considering OnePlus's track record with updates. james fuston And touchscreen reliability. Marco Well you can expect few software bugs on a 450$ phone? Yes. Also OnePlus is aware of these bugs and will address them in future updates. Can you expect so many software bugs from a $1000 phone than promises an iPhone-like experience? ... james fuston I haven't heard of any Pixel updates that broke the touchscreen for multiple users. Manjot Singh well that track record is changing Alex Dueppen Kind of. james fuston because they divorced the software company they were married to? lol k master94 Again I said Nexus like as in near stock with few bugs. I didnt mean as having the newest version of Android. Kyle Gospodnetich Looks like we've all forgotten about the faulty design of the OnePlus One that lead to countless users with touchscreen issues, and the similarly faulty design of the OnePlus Two that made the fingerprint sensor not work. I had to fix my OnePlus One myself with a piece of tape after OnePlus refused to honor the warranty. Knowledgeborn Allah I don't think you're considering the fact that the Pixel XL costs almost DOUBLE the price of the OnePlus 3T (which is the more expensive one, by the way)... I'd be fine having a few bugs on a solid device that only cost $429. I don't expect that same thing on a phone that costs $800. Kyle Gospodnetich "My touchscreen doesn't work at all" is not a "few bugs" or a "solid device". It's an unfixable hardware flaw and a warranty policy that won't fix it. Price has nothing to do with this. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree... But, then again, I don't know anybody with the OnePlus 3 or 3T who said their touchscreen stopped working. Everybody I know with the devices have said that their devices work flawlessly, at least for the most part. And, for around $400, you can't really beat that. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ That's a idiotic point. A $49 Blu phone achieves pretty much everything all other smartphones do, but the experience is vastly different from device to device. Knowledgeborn Allah Your statement is idiotic, and it's a shame that you don't realize it... If a $49 BLU phone had bugs, most people would be willing to overlook them. Why? Because the phone costs $49! Most people agree with the concept of 'getting what you pay for'. That's why, if that same phone costs $800+, most people would be less likely to overlook the issues it has. Why? Because it costs $800+! Is that really hard to understand? Michael Hannigan Yeah... But the same phone wouldn't cost $49 and $800. So your point is moot. Knowledgeborn Allah Actually, it's not. A clear example can be said about the Pixel devices as stemming from the Nexus brand. The Pixel devices are pretty much on par with the Nexus devices from last year, just with updated specs. Yet, the price skyrocketed. They're essentially selling their $500 smartphone for $800. Again, people are more willing to tolerate bugs on a $500 phone than an $800 one. Michael Hannigan No. We already figured out that when you take into consideration the value of the cables, the Pixel is only costing you $500. Knowledgeborn Allah The Pixel is only costing you $500? Seriously? Have you looked at the prices on the Google Store? That's where most people buy their Pixel phones... You're an idiot, guy. 🤦🏾‍♂️ Kevin Turabian http://mashable.com/2016/12/22/iphone-7-plus-camera-black-screen-issue/#_f3UpY5bHkq9 Has Apple admitted anything regarding the above? Phone's have problems, especially when you sell millions; these are complicated devices. Nobody's telling anybody to overlook issues, Google has admitted the issue and is going to look into it, which is awesome for a bug that has only been experienced by a relatively small number of users. That's what I expect as flagship support. Knowledgeborn Allah Flagship support? I don't know if Apple has acknowledged that issue or not. But, when it comes to practical acknowledgement, any iPhone 7 user having these issues can walk into an Apple store and have their device repaired or replaced on the spot. "That's what I expect as flagship support." Michael Hannigan Why do so many people claim that the Pixel XL is an $800 phone? That isn't what the phone costs. Knowledgeborn Allah The Pixel XL costs $769 for the base model of 32gb of storage, which would be around $800 after taxes. Most people would probably opt for the 128gb model because of general storage capacity for apps and services. At least that's what I did. That actually costs MORE than $800... The regular Pixel costs $649, and the 128gb model is $749, which is going to be over $800 after taxes too. So, I'm not sure what you're talking about. Yes, the Pixel is priced at $800+ for most variants. WestSiide So how much exactly does it cost? Manjot Singh trust me,buy a op3 and you wont regret it. Knowledgeborn Allah Agreed. Not for you http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/08/02/nexus-5-users-are-encountering-serious-volume-bugs-after-the-july-ota/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/20/some-nexus-6ps-have-developed-a-battery-early-shutoff-problem-and-its-becoming-a-safety-issue/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/11/30/bug-watch-vehicle-bluetooth-call-audio-problems-being-reported-on-all-four-nexus-phones-with-marshmallow/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/03/11/bug-watch-nfc-service-repeatedly-dies-on-nexus-devices-running-kitkat-a-fix-is-planned/ http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/04/13/some-nexus-5-owners-afflicted-by-camera-crashes-following-android-5-1-update/ TL;DR - the implication that nexus devices were bug-free is laughable. MJ No one said Pixel/Nexus phones are bug free? The OP said the Pixel was beta quality (ridiculous) and OnePlus phones are almost problem free (yeah no). Should I also post some links? Did we already forget the horrible memory management issues with the OnePlus 3 at launch? LOL For what is it is worth, I have had none of those issues with my Pixel XL. Knowledgeborn Allah I had plenty of bugs on my Nexus devices from time to time, but I was alright with that because the phones were cheap. That's not the case for the Pixel and Pixel XL... In other words, bugs are easy to excuse on a cheap device. But, when you're paying close to $1,000 for a phone and accessories, you should be getting better quality for your money. MJ I hate to break this to you but Samsung flagship phones and Apple phones have always had various software and hardware issues like any other phones. Knowledgeborn Allah You don't remember Apple's old slogan, "It just works"? I'm sure there are lines and lines of iPhone customers who would disagree with you. The iPhone 7 Plus is the first iOS device I've ever owned, and I've yet to have a single issue with it. At all. No slowdowns, no random reboots, no app crashes, nothing. So, I'm not sure what you're talking about. When it comes to Samsung, their philosophy is different. Yes, they have bugs from time to time, but you're getting a ridiculous amount of features in their devices so that you'll overlook the small issues you may have with them. And, either way, those issues don't compare to the Pixel phones. With Samsung phones, a lot of people experience issues with it. But they're not a bunch of different issues, and new ones definitely don't pop up this frequently and consistently. If the fingerprint scanner stopped working one week, the camera refused to open the next week, and the screen randomly freezes the week after that, and more and more issues pop up every subsequent week after that, it probably wouldn't take long to realize that there's something wrong with your phone. Michael Hannigan I think the iPhone slogan was "It just barely works". Knowledgeborn Allah Spoken like somebody who's probably never used an iOS device... 🤦🏾‍♂️ Michael Hannigan I own iOS devices, terrorist. Knowledgeborn Allah Terrorist? 😂 Did you know that almost 90% of terrorist attacks in the United States are committed by white men? Figures... Lol Michael Hannigan You must have your own definition of terrorism. It's the 10% that you don't want to mention - things like the World Trade center being blown up - that's done by Muslims. That's terrorism, and that vast majority of it is done by Muslims and endorsed by other Muslims. If you don't want that to be true, keep your fellow Muslims under control instead of encouraging them and turning a blind eye. Knowledgeborn Allah First of all, I'm not Muslim... But, being honest with you, what do you call somebody who shoots up a school? What do you call somebody who plans and facilitates the construction of a dirty bomb to blow up parts of New York and Washington DC? What do you call somebody who shoots up a church full of unarmed people? What do you call somebody who writes a manifesto about how technology is evil and blows people up to "save the planet"? What do you call somebody who shoots up an abortion clinic to justify Christian fundamentalism? What do you call somebody who shoots up a movie theater or a mall because of a political ideology? Oh, I get it. They didn't tell "Allahu Akbar" before they did it, so they're exempt, right? If it's in the name of good old "Jeezus", it's all good, eh? Riiiiiiiiiiiight... 🤷🏾‍♂️ Michael Hannigan Muslim. Your name has Allah in it. Not my fault. Knowledgeborn Allah Cool with me, bud... But, based on statistics, and judging by your picture, 90% of the terrorists throughout the United States look just like you. "Not my fault." Maybe you should convert to Islam so you wouldn't look so dangerous, lol. Michael Hannigan No. Jesus was a sociopath. He was dilusional. Basically your average cult leader. Bad news. Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe you need to study up, buddy. You said Jesus was a sociopath AND that he was "dilusional" (grade school clearly didn't help you out with spelling). The problem? Sociopaths aren't delusional. Make up your mind about what you want him to be, and then get back to me. 😂 Michael Hannigan Bzzzzzzt! You need to do the studying. A delusional sociopath is a real thing. Look it up. Disappointed that you wouldn't Google that before making yourself look dumb. Knowledgeborn Allah Again, and as usual, spoken like somebody who has no idea what he's talking about... Sociopaths are NOT delusional. Maybe you should take a psychology course. You're sounding more and more like an idiot with every word you type. And, to think, this all started because you were dumb enough to bash the iPhone without ever using an iOS device. You made yourself look so stupid, your only response was, "You're a terrorist." That alone shows how intelligent you are. 😂 Michael Hannigan I think you must mean to say that sociopaths are not NECESSARILY delusional. But there is a diagnosis referred to as "Delusional Sociopath" in DSM-V. I'm a psychiatrist you moron. Learn to pick your fights. Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 This just keeps getting better and better, lol. Again, modern psychology clearly determines that sociopaths are NOT delusional. Do your homework, guy. If you're a psychiatrist, then you must suck at your job. Help yourself out. Prescribe yourself some lithium. You clearly need it. Michael Hannigan I have no idea where you get that from. What I gave you is right out of the DSM. Do you know what the DSM is? Knowledgeborn Allah I majored in psychology, moron. I know exactly what a sociopath is... I don't care what you Googled to try to substantiate your foolish ideas. If you don't know the difference between a psychopath and a psychotic, then you need to just bow out of this discussion now. Michael Hannigan In fact, here you go. One of the possible signs/symptoms of sociopathy from the DSM-V (what real doctors use) "Grandiose self image – They might see themselves as someone who is superior to others and sometimes even experiences delusions. A sociopath might see themselves as a fitting ruler of a country or even the world, but might also have delusional beliefs such as seeing themselves as a God or having super powers." Eat your words. Knowledgeborn Allah Having a grandiose self-image is not the same thing as being delusional. I thought you were a psychiatrist, lol... If you suffer from delusions of having super powers, that makes you PSYCHOTIC, not psychopathic or sociopathic. Do you even know the difference? 🤦🏾‍♂️ Michael Hannigan Psychotic delusions are distinctly different from sociopathic delusions. I was talking about Jesus. Which delusions could possibly apply to him?? ONLY sociopathic delusions. I'm not saying the man was hallucinating, you idiot. He had delusions of grandeur - that is a sociopathic trait. Now shut up and stop arguing this stupid point with me. I am correct. It's in the DSM. I've been doing this for years. I don't give a shit if you "majored" in psychology. I TEACH psychology in college. You simply are WRONG. Knowledgeborn Allah Dude, you're full of shit. It's pretty clear that you have no idea what you're talking about. I doubt you've ever opened a psychology textbook in your life. Modern psychology has concluded that sociopaths are not delusional, regardless of what you read online. But I don't even need to go that far. Even your perspective shows that you're lying. You're allegedly a psychiatrist, who teaches psychology, but you think having the name "Allah" somewhere in my screen name makes me a 'terrorist'? You think a Muslim Registry is going to become part of American law because 'Trump said so'? You sound like a bum in your mom's basement. Again, you flare up because you got exposed as being a liar and a loser, and your response is, "Well, you're a terrorist. Na nana booboo." And you expect me to believe that you're a psychiatrist? 😂 You're a clown, man. I know the story. You can be whoever you want to be on the internet, lol. Get a life, guy. Hopefully you find peace one day. Michael Hannigan Your argument is stupid. "Modern psychiatry concluded..." Makes no sense. These are names and symptoms that we attribute to a mental disorder. And that one symptom hasn't been removed from the diagnosis of sociopathy. We don't arbitrarily remove diagnostic markers from disorders, you fool. I don't know if you are really this ignorant, or just lying. Leave me alone, kid. Knowledgeborn Allah "Modern psychiatry"? Do you even know the difference between psychology and psychiatry? C'mon, man, this is getting ridiculous. And it's funny how you stick to the script you're using, because you already know that everything else you said makes you sound like an idiot. I mean, come on. What legitimate psychiatrist would EVER say that having the name "Allah" in a screen name, or even being a Muslim, makes someone a 'terrorist', especially while bragging about the US supposedly trying to create a "Muslim Registry"? You showed your stupidity as soon as you made that ridiculous assertion. That is all. I'm just hoping that you find peace one day, man. In the meantime, you should go out and get a real degree in something. You could even study psychology. You might learn something. Your mom's couch isn't going anywhere. It'll still be there when you get back. But until then, you should educate yourself. 😏 Michael Hannigan Both my parents died recently. Nice one. Knowledgeborn Allah I don't do internet sob stories. I can't validate your story as being true. So, that's that... My point still stands. If you were a legitimate psychiatrist, there's no way you would've said or believed the things you did. That's reality. You showed your bias and ignorance with your comments, and that completely eroded your credibility. I still encourage you to educate yourself, and I still hope you find peace someday. Peace is definitely something a civilized society can never have too much of. Michael Hannigan Do you live under a rock or something? You've never heard of a guy called President Elect Trump? You have never heard of his project to establish a Muslim Registry in his first 100 days in office? Why do you suppose he feels that Muslims need to register. Muslims. No one else. Why? Knowledgeborn Allah What are you talking about? The mainstream Republican party has built their entire platform on the establishment of fear. They've been doing it for decades. Where have you been? They gain mainstream appeal among their supporters by fear mongering and "encouraging" people to be afraid of the 'other' group. Adolf Hitler did the same thing in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. Why do you think he did that? Were his victims really as dangerous as he made them out to be? I'm not going to go back and forth on this, man. People spew propaganda to accomplish an objective. All of these guys have an agenda, and their words and actions, even right now, are leading the country in a very dangerous direction. I recommend that you open your eyes and look around. If you're objective, it won't take you long to figure out what's happening. Since you want to challenge things on the basis of public perception, why do you think people disproportionately view Trump supporters as violent racists, bigots and criminals? Is that just coincidental? How did you contribute to that narrative (stereotype) when you saw the word Allah written as a screen name and instantly thought "terrorist"? Think about it. Michael Hannigan No need to. Facts are facts and we are building a Muslim Registry. Sorry if the facts upset you, but I presented them as facts. Knowledgeborn Allah OK, man. Good luck with that... 😂 Michael Hannigan The thing is - caring what everyone else thinks of you is weak and not the a way to success. Nobody really cares what you think about a Muslim Registry. In fact, I'm sure all terrorists hate the idea. But it's happening anyway. Now, as you say, you fear us. Well, if that's what it takes for my family to be safe, then Muslims can continue to fear us. Knowledgeborn Allah For your family to be safe? 😳 Dude, you're not getting it. If over 90% of the terrorists in the United States are white men, then how can you expect a Muslim Registry to stop terrorism? Think about that. You're not concerned about the 265 million guns floating around the country that are being used to kill people almost every day, but you're afraid of an airplane being flown by a Muslim pilot crashing into your house. How rational is that? But hey, that's your business, man. I'm not going to keep going on and on with this. Believe whatever you want. Duckfart You are a moron and should stop arguing. And just because you googled it, it doesn't make it so. You sir are a dip Shite, I know I googled it. alpha2beta http://www.dailywire.com/news/7441/7-statistics-you-need-know-about-black-black-crime-aaron-bandler Knowledgeborn Allah I don't get the point of this post... What does this have to do with the fact that over 90% of terrorist attacks in the United States are committed by white men? You're feeling bad about that and wanted to throw up figures about "black on black crime" that you found with a quick Google search? Classic projection. 😂 Here - I can do that too, lol... http://usuncut.com/black-lives-matter/black-on-black-crime/ alpha2beta Your definition of terrorism is different then others. If it's whites commiting a crime it's terrorism if it's blacks commiting a crime it's just regular crime nothing to see. Media doesn't even talk about it because it's racist to talk about black commiting crimes. Knowledgeborn Allah First of all, what does this have to do with Android, the Google Pixel, or anything related to that? Regarding what you just posted: You sound like an idiot, dude. I don't even know why you spoke on this, since you apparently don't even know the difference between crime and terrorism. Now you're trying to justify white terrorism (we can't deny that it is disproportionate) because other racial demographics of people commit crimes targeted towards their communities? Those aren't even close to being the same... I get it, though. Anything to somehow 'redeem your people', eh? Must be that inner-Skinhead kicking in. 😂 Have a good one, guy. alpha2beta You started talking about race buddy. Knowledgeborn Allah No, I made a statement of fact about TERRORISM, in response to that other guy's misguided views regarding it. He's been convinced of the idea that Muslims are terrorists, and that all terrorist attacks are committed by Muslims. I simply educated him on the facts - that the vast majority of terrorists in the United States are not Arabs. They're not Persian, Turkish, Pakistani, Palestinian, or anything else. They're not the "others". They're people who look just like him, who dress like him, who speak his language, who shop at the same stores he goes to. Racism is what stops people from acknowledging that, because everybody wants to see the "other" people as the bad guys. In reality, that's just not the case. alpha2beta Liberal ran news sites. The FBI own statistics show otherwise. Knowledgeborn Allah Umm, yeah... Because all the conservative and "alt-right" (neo-Nazi?) ones are so much better and more accurate, lol. Grow up, dude. All news sites are designed to spread a message, to push you in a certain direction, whether that's to the left or the right. Everybody has an agenda. If you don't know the difference between fact and fiction, research and propaganda, then I don't know what to tell you. Maybe you should educate yourself too. JPLoureiro Fucking reported, you piece of shit. Michael Hannigan Fact is, my country is compiling a Muslim Registry where all Muslims will be required to register so they can be monitored. That isn't being done for "no reason". Sorry, but facts are facts. Knowledgeborn Allah Dude, you're a moron. A "Muslim Registry" is never going to happen. Or are you dumb enough to believe everything you read on the internet? Your country? You mean the same one that clearly imposes in its constitution the FREEDOM OF RELIGION? Anybody who proposes the idea of banning or discriminating against people based on religion is about as "un-American" as you can possibly get... But hey, don't blame me. Take it up with the Founding Fathers. 🤷🏾‍♂️ JPLoureiro Don't really care about your country's political system and much less about your Nazi agenda when we're here trying out to help each other out so we can make Android with as it should. Knowledgeborn Allah By the way, how will this "Muslim Registry" happen exactly? Did you know that Islam is a religion? Did you know that somebody can convert to Islam (just like any other religion), becoming a Muslim, and then drop it the next day? Did you know that people can claim to be Muslims without actually being Muslims? Did you know that, if people ever came in and asked a Muslim, "Are you a Muslim?", he could very easily say "no" to avoid that so-called registry? What's the plan if that happens? I'm curious. 😂 alpha2beta My god every article about the Pixel phone I see you constantly talking about how much better Your iPhone 7 is and all of the extra features on the Galaxy s7. We get it stop trolling and move on if you have nothing useful to say. Knowledgeborn Allah Useful to say about the Pixel? Stay in your lane, bud... For the record, I never said the Pixel was a bad phone. In fact, I've said repeatedly that I have the Pixel XL, and I enjoy the software experience. It's just not worth its price. Don't get mad at me for that, blame Google. They're the ones who decided to price-gouge people for a mediocre phone because they put "stock Android" on it. Nickname303 I hate to break this to you but you run and hide like every other troll that acts tough on the internet, when someone gives you some of your own treatment. Your parents must be so proud that they raised such such a wimpy p*ssy! Maybe your father was a p*ssy too and that's why you are? See you later wimp Michael Hannigan LOL! Now it's a $1000 phone? Let's just round it up and say it's a $5000 phone? Knowledgeborn Allah 😂 I said a phone AND accessories... With that glass plate on the back of the phone, most people are going to get a case for the phone, which can run anywhere from $30 to $100. Most of the people I know who got the phone bought extra USB-C cables for it too, to put in their offices or cars, etc. Quality USB-C cables cost around $40+ right now. Those are just the basics. When you factor in taxes, shipping and general pricing of all these items, you'll be paying around $1,000. Would it be better if I rounded it down and said $900? I don't know how much money you have, but even $900 is a lot of money to me, and I live a pretty comfortable lifestyle. Michael Hannigan It comes with two USB cables. I'm not sure what kind of idiot would spend $40+ for another one. So, what you are saying is that Google gives you like $100 worth of USB cables with the phone? That's pretty good. And since no person in any state pays tax on Google Store orders, that brings the Pixel down to $500 and change when you consider the $100 worth of cables it includes. WestSiide Taxes are paid in cali. Knowledgeborn Allah As far as I know, taxes for products purchased from the Google Store are paid everywhere. jomcty Google charges taxes for purchases from NC. Michael Hannigan $100 for a fucking CASE!!!!???? ARE YOU INSANE????? Not for you I guess the TL;DR was too long for you? Hint: "implication" is a real word. Look it up. Nickname303 Hey MJ, I see you're still hiding from me! Why would you act all tough and then just hide like a girl? Well the only explanation is that you're a silly p*ssy that runs away crying when given some of their own medicine. Hide between your mother legs MJ like you're still at school lol. What an utter wimp MJ I have no issue with OnePlus but saying Pixel phones are beta quality is ridiculous. Nougat is the best Android release ever (maybe someday you guys will get it) and my Pixel XL has been problem free and just as fast/smooth as day one. BROKEN 1+ is a joke of a company. cheeto0 Its kind of the opposite. Oneplus is very beta like and the pixel is solid. I say get the oneplus though if you don't want to spend extra on a pixel. I had a oneplus 3 when it first came out and I had a lot of trouble, most was eventually fixed with updates. The pixel I have since launch with no problems. Adam no halos? lol even google acknowledged it and you have "no problems" Michael Hannigan W/e? What the hell lazy shorthand is that? Knowledgeborn Allah It means "whatever"... 😂 ck125 But I thought stock android doesn't have these issues? Only Samsung devices. Lol come on google TypoCorrecto Nice strawman...Try again kid. ck125 Sadly it's true. Everyone always says "get a nexus/pixel" it won't have the bugs skinned devices have. Nexus and pixel are the beta testers, always have been. Kevin Turabian Every device has at least some issues in a small number of devices especially when they sell in large numbers, no matter who manufactures it or provides the software. Samsung's latest phone's are excellent but the Pixel is the most complete Android phone ever provided and is the furthest thing from a beta test anybody could imagine. Early Nexus could maybe be seen as a beta test, but even later Nexus phones were excellent. MJ ALL phones have some issues... The fact is in my experience with Nexus devices and my Pixel XL is they have no more problems and run more smooth than what Samsung puts out six months later. Knowledgeborn Allah I'm not too sure about that one. It seems like new issues are popping up with the Pixel variants almost every week. It's almost like Google perfected the software enough for the reviews to come out, and then, after everybody hyped it up and said how great it is, Google just said, "F*ck it, we're done now. They're already hooked!" I'm not saying it's a terrible device by any means. But, even on skinned devices, new issues don't pop up this frequently. Software shouldn't be set to expire after a couple months. Seba Olivares I might have lost the 3,5mm jack but my iPhone 7 Plus works perfectly. Google trying to replicate the iOS experience is going to hell :) PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ krApple iP7+ is a piece of shit compared to the XL. Pat yourself on the back for being a krApple Fashion-Firster. Nathan J The A10 SoC in the iPhone 7 "Fashionably" annihilates the Snapdragon 821 SoC. HTC has had a really bad year. I can't really blame people for wanting to believe in someone, but you can't blame someone for buying Apple over HTC. Especially after the HTC 10 bootloop fiasco. The iPhone 7 has reported issues of its own, but I'd rate it above either HTC flagship. The Pixel or the 10. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Erm... you read "reviews", while I compare the iP7+ and Pixel XL every day IRL. The only "annihilating" that goes on is XL beating down the iP7+ in the ways it matters to me- pics, HD pic processing and a smooth-as-glass UX, smoother browsing and incredible battery efficiency. Nathan J Benchmarks, not reviews. But close enough. Use what works best for you and I'll do the same, but buying HTC is quite risky. I hope you can still get a stock Android phone on Verizon when I'm done with my iPhone 6s. I just hope it's not made by HTC and isn't huge. I have no need for a large phone. There day I do, I'll just get a tablet. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ And good luck to you, sir, in your endeavor. raazman Lol, the iPhone and iOS 10 have already gone to hell. MattPortland Really? I have not encountered any hellish issues and I run beta versions. raazman There are 3 iPhones in the family, I'm doing tech support for all 3. Apple has some horrible quality control nowadays. MattPortland Support in regards to? raazman Sim card errors, freezing, battery dying at 30℅, losing network connectivity, etc. Over the past few years there have been numerous issues that I've dealt with. I'm not saying Android is perfect, but it's been less of a hassle as long as you're buying flagship devices. MattPortland None of that has been a hassle for me or anyone I know with an iPhone. *shrug* raazman Yeah, just yesterday in was dealing with an iPhone 7 that kept saying sim card not inserted and then kept popping up the activation screen. It's been a headache. Knowledgeborn Allah ^^^Agreed 100%! I've never encountered a single problem with my iP7+. The software is smooth and buttery, the hardware is perfectly optimized, the CPU is the fastest on the market, and updates are pretty much instantaneous. And, to top it off, customer service is outstanding, to the degree that I can just walk into an Apple store and ask for help if I have any issues. The Pixel just can't compete with that right now. Geoff Johnson My iPhone 7+ has had apps freeze and crash much more often than my Pixel. Knowledgeborn Allah What version of iOS are you using? I've had the iPhone 7+ for months, and I've never encountered as much as a single stutter or hiccup on my phone... If you're having that many issues, you can always go to an Apple store and see the guys at the Genius Bar. They're apparently able to work out any problem you might be having. The Support tab in the Settings menu of the Pixel is cool and all, but it doesn't compare to going out and troubleshooting the problems with real people. Just saying. Kevin Turabian The support tab on the Pixel let's the remote support team take over your device while chatting with them. It's instant and the support team can get all the information they need quickly. Going to a store is nice and walking out with a new phone is obviously nice, but overnight shipping for a new device or solving a problem without leaving the house is pretty awesome as well. Knowledgeborn Allah I agree that it's a decent system. Again, I have the Pixel XL, and I like the phone. Is it the "best overall phone of 2016"? Not even close! But yes, it's a very good phone, just like my Nexus 6P was a very good phone, and so was my Nexus 6 before that, etc. I'm not bashing the phone. I'm just saying that people need to take off these rose-colored glasses and realize that the Pixel phones weren't everything everybody wanted them to be. They fell short in a lot of areas, and more issues keep popping up nearly every week. Michael Hannigan Yeah, works perfectly... Except that it's an iPhone. Paladin Yeah, every time an iPhone user points out that we aren't having any problems with the iPhone 7/7Plus nor with iOS 10, all it does it piss off the android fanboys, especially the ones that paid too much for Pixel (the price of an iPhone with more problems than just about any previous android device. ) they don't want to hear it, but they are the ones that are stuck with that poor excuse of a phone. No stereo speaker and no waterproofing? Really? And it's the same price as an iPhone? Really? duhhhhh Doms is life360 the culprit then? Getting my XL tomorrow Johnny James I had the problem without life360. Ajax Dono Make that 101 users. I have had the issue since the upgrade to 7.1.1. it was happening 2 to 3 times per day until I uninstalled fleksy keyboard.i also have life 360 but dont want to uninstall. Crashing once per week now. I can deal with that I guess. Price we pay for a new model with newest OS. Oh and support told me I should uninstall all 3rd party apps lol. Knowledgeborn Allah Uninstall all 3rd party apps? WTF? 😂 Marcelove "Google's trying to market the new Pixel and Pixel XL phones as premium, market-leading devices, and a big part of that is nailing the software experience. " Nope, just the price is from a premium device... Everything else premium is just the illusion of owners that will ignore any problem to justify the abusive price for such hardware+software... No one that spent $800 will accept the reality that this price isn't acceptable for such device and unconsciously will close the eyes for obvious problems... And worse: many readers here at AP were Nexus owners and still bought the Dead Pixel... Google gave the middle finger to them and still they gave money to Google... So I think I'm wrong at my first sentence: besides the premium price, the only other thing from a premium device (iPhone) is the field of reality distortion that Google is using, like Apple, at its customers. thomasguide2 I don't understand why any Nexus fan would buy a Pixel. It's slap in the face with the iphone clone design and iphone pricing with software updates and cloud photo storage as it's main selling points. I don't get it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ They're brilliant phones - best on the planet. If you actually get to experience one, you'll know. thomasguide2 For that price I'd rather get a GS7. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Sammy's are fine hardware, but no compromises on the XL. Mine's worth every penny and brings me happiness every time I interact with it. thomasguide2 Sounds like your blow doll. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Projecting again? Lars Jeppesen Waterproofness and slim bezels are things I cannot live without in a phone.. Unfortunately PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Agreed. If they're deal-breakers, then Sammy is the one. If a seamless, beautiful phone experience that makes my life easier and more relaxing, then you have to go XL. WestSiide I feel the same way about my cock. And just so theres no confusion, when i say cock, i am in fact referring to my penis. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Erm... I think you opened the wrong app by mistake, ace. This is what you were looking for ;) http://www.glreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/grindr.jpg AsterMK I've experienced using a Pixel. It's a mediocre flagship. Your username tells me you might be just a lil' bit biased towards it though. Just a bit. Knowledgeborn Allah In all fairness, its main selling points were the Google Assistant and "best camera on a smartphone"... I bought the Pixel XL just because I was used to getting the newest Nexus device every year. And, for the most part, the phone feels like another Nexus device. It's a decent software experience, and the camera is good (I personally think there are a couple other phones with better overall cameras, but that's just me). But, in my opinion, it's definitely overpriced. They should probably be at least $100 cheaper for what you're getting. Kevin Turabian Seriously? It's what a lot of us Nexus die hards wanted from Google all along. It looks a little like the iPhone, but the in hand feel is totally different and nobody would mistake one for the other. I'm amazed at how much hate there is on this site for the Pixel, the amount of negative comments on every article pointing out an issue that affects a tiny number of devices. I wonder if imore has this many hateful comments about the iPhone 7+ camera failing. MattPortland Nope. Navin Govindani Couldn't agree more, had been waiting for something like that from Google ever since I got my N4 thomasguide2 It's over priced, Nexus = affordable, Pixel = expensive. It may have a better camera and a new launcher but is that worth $400 over a one plus 3? Amit_N Pixel is the phone on which everything can be *fixed* by a software update Berkay Not the huge bezels, lack of waterproofing, and lack of stereo speakers... navjack I count two speakers on the pixel. I put an otter case on mine so I'd have more bezel. Berkay LOL no, that thing only has one speaker. My Dixie Wrecked Yep! I just encountered this scary guy yesterday for the first time. Thought my phone was toast. Brian Duncan Wonder if it has anything to do with the new EU GPS constellation, Galileo? XerBlade I had this problem (and never could seem to find the time to Google and/or contact support about it), but I haven't had it happen since I uninstalled updates for the Google app then reupdated (in order to get off the beta channel) just under a week ago. It could just be dormant though. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ P.S. This is my first time even hearing of Life360. jawsnnn My pixels assistant app froze and wouldn't listen. Contacted Google support. They recommended clearing cache (which I had already tried). Then it cave back to the tried and tested reboot phone... which for some reason worked. Jason Madura More and more problems with pixel and xl..... Sooooooo glad I ended up going with the V20!! Funny.... Google makes Android and puts out the next iterations of it.... can't put out a phone that doesn't have bugs and problems.... Other OEM's take these versions and make them glide like waxed steel on ice... Sans Samsung. Hahaha Android has been leaps and bounds ahead of iphones for years.... first time Google heads their own phone.... they make one that is so simple and iphone-esque.... they set themselves back while other OEM's made their own software even better. Google.... Do you even know how to Google? thomasguide2 If they only made their own hardware oh wait... they sold that for a 9 billion dollar loss. Great move! It's odd that the HTC 10 doesn't seem to have these problems. Jason Madura Thanks for furthering my point mate! Google used to be top notch.... Seems like the last few years they have been hitting the decline in all things.... I think the Goog has peaked and is on the downward slope. Can't wait to see what the next "Google" is though and what they bring to the table! Lol thomasguide2 This company makes some bizarre decisions, they had motorola and chose to contract out Nexus devices to other oems. Huh? If they still owned Moto they could control the software and the hardware. Instead they have to rely on HTC or Huawaie. It doesn't make any sense. MJ Ummmm I have owned the unlocked HTC 10 (which I liked) and now a Pixel XL. Sorry, my Pixel is faster/smoother and has virtually zero lag which was NOT the case with my HTC 10 (not bad or anything). The only hardware problem I had between the two was the HTC 10 had the weakest NFC ever on a phone. Knowledgeborn Allah Android has NEVER been leaps and bounds ahead of iPhones. And I'm speaking from the perspective of somebody who loves Android (to the extent of being almost fanboy-ish). Yeah, you'll almost always have more features and better customization on Android phones. But, when it comes to speed, fluidity, and consistency, iOS has always been far ahead of Android. Their software has always been more optimized, their OEM support has always been more reliable, and their apps have always been more polished. Those are just facts. Google used the Pixel variants to try to mimic the iPhone experience because they already know that. tim242 All of that is bullshit. You should visit Apple sites for the constant issues that plague iOS. Apple releases so many .0x versions trying to fix issues, and constantly causing more. The grass isn't greener. Knowledgeborn Allah Have you seen the Android experience? Google does the exact same thing, they're just labeled differently... Why do you think they have "security patches" every month? Instead of .0x version updates, they just have monthly labels of security patch levels. tim242 Google does not release anywhere near as many updates. Security patches are just that...security patches. My S7 has not received an update that has broken anything. Security patches certainly don't cause issues. Apple still can't get BT working properly...after all these years. Knowledgeborn Allah Tell that to my Pixel XL, which constantly disconnects and reconnects to my car's Bluetooth every few minutes ever since the December security patch... Google releases an update every single month. Apple updates their devices pretty frequently, but more than once a month? Not even close. If you install the beta versions, then yes, you may get updates nearly every week sometimes. But when it comes to general public releases? They're probably about once a month, just like Google, if that often. Sir_Brizz iOS used to be ahead in speed, fluidity, and consistency a few years ago. Ever since Jobs died they have consistently delivered a worse experience to the point today where I would say they are typically pretty equal to and sometimes worse than Android. Knowledgeborn Allah Maybe when it comes to certain things... But let's be honest here. Objectively speaking, LAST year's iPhone 6s is faster than all of the Android phones of 2016. That's just reality. iOS 10 is more fluid and consistent than Nougat, which is the newest version of Android, which, by the way, almost nobody even has except Pixel and Nexus owners. Those are facts. I'm far from being an Apple fanboy, but I have to acknowledge the facts in this matter. I'm not saying that iOS is "better" than Android, but I do think it's more consistent and fluid, and their devices are definitely faster. Sir_Brizz No, it's really not. I agree that the raw performance of the device is objectively better. But in practice... It's not. The 6S+ on iOS10 has noticeable UI lag and the transition animations are extremely slow. Apps take a very long time to come up. Part of this is just design decisions that Apple has made and that's fine. They are good devices. But they are nowhere near as fluid as they used to be. It's very noticeable. Personally I find Android since Marshmallow to be a much nicer and smoother experience. That doesn't mean the raw processing power is better. Android simply isn't as aggressive at neutering things as iOS is. Knowledgeborn Allah I can't contest that. I've never owned a 6s Plus, so I don't know. I do have the 7 Plus, though, and I can honestly say that it's better than any Android phone I've ever owned, including the Pixel XL. I like the Android experience, but, ever since the Nexus 6P, I haven't even done as much as unlock my bootloader. The customization factor doesn't hold me over anymore. I am tied into Google's ecosystem pretty heavily, but I have pretty much all the Google apps on iOS, and they seem to run better on iOS than they do on Android. It's almost like having the best of both worlds. Sir_Brizz My wife has a 7+. When it gets iOS 11 it will have noticeable UI lag. It has happened to each of the last two generations of devices. They are just too aggressive at power saving. I haven't done custom ROMs since I bought my N5, but there are still many things I prefer on Android over iOS. The primary thing is notifications. Android notifications are in a whole other universe compared to the garbage that is iPhone notifications. I could name lots of other things but they one by itself keeps me on Android. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ LAST year's iPhone 6s is faster than all of the Android phones of 2016. LMAO Not by a long shot, chief. Again, my wife had the 6s+ and it was AWFUL and laggy. She traded to the iP7+ and it is a punitive, strange otherworldly nighmare in several ways, but faster than the 6s. Neither come close to the IRL performance and UX of the Pixel XL. tim242 Sans Samsung? Bahaha says the person using a SHITTY LG. GO HOME. Falcon Im on the s7 beta 4. Not a single reboot since the first beta. So much for the most optimized phone ! PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The best phone ever made. The XL is just stunning in ever way (and knocks iP7+'s dick in the dirt) escept bottom-fire speakers. But they are pretty loud nonetheless. Knowledgeborn Allah You really want to compare the Pixel to the iPhone 7 Plus after an article like this? Seriously? Lol! 🤦🏾‍♂️ PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I compare them every day. My wife got her iP7+ two days after I got my XL and the Pixel is vastly superior in every facet excpet for teh botom speaker. Knowledgeborn Allah OK, it's clear that you're being a troll. Lol! Have a good day, man... 😂 BROKEN iPhone 7+ is much better then the PixSuck PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ krApple eye-fone good fone! Me wike cool silhouette dance 'mercials! Knowledgeborn Allah 🤦🏾‍♂️ You're part of a dying breed, bud. I don't know if anybody told you, but blind fanboys and blanket "brand haters" are way out of style. You should probably keep up with the times. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ lol! PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I do what makes me happy. Could not care less what's in "style" or what other people do. I'm a black wolf-dog, not a sheep. Lawrence The iPhone 7 is faster at loading anything and keeping apps opened. tim242 The iPhone 7 Plus has its own issues. Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... But I'm talking about NEW issues. The iPhone doesn't have new issues like this popping up every week. From camera lens flare, to problems with Google Assistant, to random reboots, to speaker issues, to this. 😳 How long has the phone been out? New issues shouldn't be popping up this frequently. Navin Govindani These issues are just being faced by a small number of users, very unfair to make a comparison based on them keeping in mind that iOS 10, even on the latest bunch of iPhones has a whole variety of stupid bugs like not being able to answer a call because of the unresponsiveness or having issues in the dialer and these are widespread, I can assure you that because a lot of people in my family have the new iPhones Brad Andrews The issues are incredibly minor too. When I first saw the whole issues blowing up earlier this week about the speakers I thought oh wow this must be a major problem. Then after reading realised that it just sounds like the speakers are being allowed to be slightly overdriven for their capabilities and knocking 1-2 bars off the volume depending on the video fixes it. Then I was just like, really? This has been blown way out of proportion. Sounds like if Google had just limited the max volume to slightly less the 'issue' would never have appeared in the first place. MicroNix Don't forget bluetooth. Nickname303 And so do you Dim Tim tiger Was that a joke? abc Nah, just typical fanboy stupidity. You don't really expect someone who loves a phone so much that he would name his avatar after it to be objective, do you? Marco and except bluetooth issues (with both car and stuttering audio on headphones), camera lens flare, signal dropping, issues with the speaker... I'm just collecting random bugs and defects I've read on the internet. Certainly not worth 900$+. Long live OnePlus. iPhone 7 Plus has it's own defects, most of them software because iOS is fr from perfect, but I've encountered only glitches here and there. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I've never had any of those issues. Zsolt V Surprise. Maybe you are lying? PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ lol. No, my XL continues to be a sheer joy to own since October 20th. Scott Harris Had it happen several times a couple weeks ago on my 6P. Hadn't received an OS update in a while on the Android Beta program but I unenrolled and set the device up as new and haven't had problems since then. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I got mine October 22nd and it's been impeccable every second of every day. RenatoFontesTapia Google can't make anything right =( Nexus 5x lag, Nexus 6p turning off before the battery runs out, and now this u_u raazman So then put Apple and Samsung in that same group. drcaveman My wife's iPhone dies at 30% my note 7 was returned for fear of spontaneous detination all phones have problems it's how the manufacturer deals with the issue that makes the difference in this case, Samsung immediately issued a recall, Apple told my wife the recall for iPhones only applied to the S+ model, and it appears Google's been on the quick to mend many issues, although I don't think they ever fully got the 5X perfect they did try though. Google is working on a fix for the 6P as it's likely software related TheByteSmasher Nexus 6P also freezing on 7.1.1... Often on chrome ☹️ MJ Life360's family locator? I had to look that one up... How creepy! An app to GPS the entire family. Yes, just uninstall... Orlando aka Pixel XL Some Pixel owners do nothing but try to find problems, I never had one thing wrong with my phone since day one. I feel like people just keep trying to dog out the phone because of how much it cost and salty Nexus owners. I've been Nexus since Samsung Nexus, either move on with Pixel or go buy OnePlus 3t... tim242 It's so easy to just randomly find speaker issues, connection problems, and freezes. Some people LIKE YOU just want to live in denial. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ No denial needed if they don't exist. I have had zero issues that you mention or otherwise. Mine has been flawless literally 24/7 since Oct. 22nd. It's the best phone on the planet, pound-forpound. Knowledgeborn Allah It's funny how you say it's the "best phone on the planet"... Have you owned every single phone on the planet in order to compare it with all of them? Just wondering, because that's a pretty bold statement. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ I've owned the best flagships from LG, Sammy, Moto and Huawei - they all have nice features here and there, but are crap UX or crap something else. My wife owns the iP7+ and it's a nightmare. So, no, don't need to own every phone onthe planet to make that declaration, but I know which ones are premium and they all blow chunks compared to my XL. Sir_Brizz The iPhone of Android. No compromise device. Knowledgeborn Allah Not quite... Nathan J Well, it compromised by leaving off the memory card slot. It compromised by leaving off the IR blaster. They definitely compromised by using HTC after the HTC 10 bootloop fiasco. Calling the Pixel the iPhone of Android isn't giving the iPhone enough credit. Though I don't come to AP looking for iPhone to get the credit it's due. Quite the opposite. But I've seen three Android users/iPhone haters go to iPhone in the last year (myself first among them) and be quite happy. Some people find an OEM and stick with them. I want to try them all. Apple is different but the different perspective is refreshing. Android the OS is better, sure, but iOS isn't that bad if you just want to do basic smartphone stuff. Facebook, Spotify, Subway Surfers... any phone's gonna be good enough. You wanna test for Cyanogen or one of the other custom firmware teams? Yeah you're gonna need Android... for the rest of us, it doesn't matter. Sir_Brizz /s? Nathan J No. I don't think you understand what a compromise is. The best of Android should have those things. Otherwise it's just a compromise. Sir_Brizz I meant my post. :p maverick7526 Nexus phones haven't had a SD card in a long time, and I don't believe they had an IR blaster ever. If your want those things get a Samsung. Google have given up on SD cards as they are slower and usually cause more issues with the phone. Nathan J Still compromises. For the record, only the first one (Nexus One) had an SD card. You're right about both reasons they don't have them. Still consumer hostile. And the LG G5, I believe has the IR blaster, not the S7. Has Samsung ever had an IR blaster? I don't think they have. HTC had them before the 10. This year they passed on them and LG picked it up. Really cool feature. But not really essential. Jen Interesting. I had installed Life360 a long while ago (Nexus 5X? 2013 Moto X?), but even at that time, it was just WAY too resource intensive and my phone was much happier after uninstalling. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something *very* poorly designed about that particular app that wreaks havoc. And, perhaps the folks who don't have Life360 installed are using a similarly poorly designed app instead? IVBela *Yawns* What was the price again? I heard somebody talking about premium quality and shit. *crickets* YaKillaCJ Lol I passed on the Pixel because their isn't anything "premium" about it. It takes more than metal and glass. Bring something new to the table, raise the bar and warrant the $800+. Instead it doesn't even match the competition, yet want praise for "doing the basics right". Yet it fairs the same as a Nexus. I want the Pixel to succeed because it can set the record straight about what "Real Android" is and not OEMs bloated, laggy, unupdated crap forced on the general public. But I personally wouldn't use the Pixel even if it was a gift without any strings attached. Ok mini rant over. Michael Hannigan Totally premium. Michael Hannigan Yes you would. YaKillaCJ No I wouldn't. The only redeeming quality is stock Android comes pre-installed. I can do that myself as every device I have is rooted and the bootloader unlocked. All my devices run just as fast in real time because they run custom optimized software. No physical nav buttons is a huge downside for me. Not even the benefit of front facing speakers as compensation. Another issue is as if right now, no Xposed which is a must for me. If I had this phone, it would literally sit in the drawer. I still use my LG-G3 because although it lacks physical nav buttons, it has an IR Blaster and Wireless charging and perfect as a remote to control everything connected (or non-connected) in my home. Michael Hannigan Yes you would. Michael Hannigan Xposed sucks. Buggiest piece of garbage out there. Cat Astrophy >No physical nav buttons is a huge downside for me. Then you don't know what phone quality is because buttons break down. A screen won't and software can be easily fixed. YaKillaCJ Seriously this your logic. Why use air inflated rubber tires because the thread and rubber wear down. That said, I have never seen broken Navigation Buttons on a device outside an iPhone or Android with a broken screen in which they lost the button. Even still if I break or want to just disable the buttons, I can use On Screen Buttons. It has nothing to do with premium, if anything, its the opposite. Which is why several OEMs give the option to switch between Onscreen or Physical plus their order. Nee Austin Honestly it's surprised me by being way better than expected. I once thought as you, but have been proven wrong. The phone is actually delightful overall. (Except for the speaker location which is certifiably idiotic. I'd fire the Google manager who signed off on that.) YaKillaCJ U may not get what I mean tho. Sure it works, that's it's point in keeping it simple. Everything out has works the way it's meant to by not trying to do too much. That however doesn't warrant a $800+ price. Standing out and innovation does. That said right now I already have the "just works" experience. My phone been off the charger from 6am - 6pm and @ 75% with 3 hours SOT. 35min call, 2 hours of music (via Bluetooth and with Viper4Android), always connected to my Moto360 (1st Gen) and up time of 73 hours. The only reason I rebooted is too update an Xposed Module because I can count on my hand how many "force closed" I've had. navjack You want it to succeed but you won't buy it? YaKillaCJ For me, its lacking in several ways. However for others, it's likely the best option. Much how Android is way ahead and better than iOS. It's just that iOS devices can be a better option for some. JohnyNoLegs Do I want the best Android phone right now, if yes get the pixel. If I am poor and don't want the best, get anything else. Seriously it's not that hard to understand. No phone had everything. breon The Pixel starts at $649, which is the same price as an unlocked iPhone 7 and $50 cheaper than a Galaxy S7. YaKillaCJ The version worth getting starts at $869 (+$99 for 2 year protection). No SDcard means the 128GB is required. ggggg I also heard people talking about a premium quality phone called Galaxy Note7. It cost over $800. And finally there were… some problems. Dennis Ulijn ... and people got their money back. I dislike Samsung and you might think about them the way you do, but they solved it the best way possible. Brad Andrews Yeah, Beacause it was a hazard to people's lives. If it was a buggy app on the phone that caused it to lag sometimes, then there wouldn't have been a response from Samsung. It's only because they knew they could be up for millions and millions of dollars worth of lawsuits. MicroNix Minutes of freezing isn't lag, that's a problem. A rather big problem. Let's not sugar coat this as "lag". ggggg Not false… Michael Hannigan Yeah. Every company that gets a complaint about a product should immediately withdraw that product from the market and take a billion dollar loss. One size fits all solution. You solved it. 2kool4skool Nah, Note 7 costs 0$ cause people got their money back. This ugly-overhyped-problem-infested so called pixel on the other hand... Michael Hannigan They haven't had a chance to give everyone's money back. Maybe they will. Who knows? Michael Hannigan Best phone ever made so far. abc Why bother commenting? Google fanboys are very predictable. abc Don't you dare complain that a phone that is supposedly worth the premium price because of its "great software" has multiple issues with its software. Also, other phones have issues. So don't pick on our chosen one. Sincerely, Google fanboys FuckenJoe Not experiencing this. I don't have life 360 installed though. Nathan J Been telling you guys about HTC for a few months now... hate to say I told you so but.... told you so. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ This is about Google, not HTC. HTC was the ODM on this device, that's it. And they did a superb job at that. Ted Tabaka I literally just had this happen 20 minutes ago when I was trying to post a video on Facebook! shamatuu figure it out Google. Jordan L My Pixel XL has been pretty damned great! I did have a strange about 5 second freeze today. First time. Looking for 7.1.2 jhnsmth Life360 never installed, haven't had any issues yet on my Pixel XL Phil Kulak Yeah, getting it on my phone too. I'm not removing Life360 though. vladashram A nasty issue on the Pixel and Pixel XL lately is broken dual system images. The myriad of issues causes with the version of Android running randomly changing with reboots for some people is terrible. Check out out here on the official Google Product Forums. https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/phone-by-google/DtvS_XxvBh8;context-place=forum/phone-by-google From what I pieced together, this affects both phones from the Google Play Store and Verizon, but the issue only appeared to people who were on either Verizon in the US or Rogers in Canada(So Far anyway) when they received the OTA which triggers the issue. ItsRamiL This probably has nothing to do with the article but I feel like I need to say it so here goes. I've always liked Nexus and I've always liked the pure Android experience, so naturally i like the Pixel line. Whenever I bough Nexus devices, I've always thought of them as cheap developer devices, so I kinda expected *small* problems here and there. Lately, though, I feel myself moving away from Google's offerings. I have a Nexus 5X and I've already had it replaced multiple times because of the bootloop problem (here's to hoping this one doesn't.) Google support is quick to replace it and I like that, but I bought a phone to use it, not send it in "every month" for it to be replaced. I thought if this one bootloops and I do end up getting the refund many people report they are giving out now, i'd buy a 6P, but lately all these problems with the battery are swaying me against that. So, naturally, I thought of the Pixel. A premium price, so must be a premium phone. No more issues like Nexus devices. Now all I see is camera problems, *terrible* speaker problems, and now random freezes by certain apps. It's hard for me to see myself buying one, even though i'd really like to. Google really needs to step up their game in hardware if they want to keep customers, or stay with what they do best, search and software. Now here's the part where the comments might start flooding in. This year is the first year I have ever even considered an iPhone. Sure, they have problems too, but never usually as wide spread as these, and most of the time, Apple fixes these problems. But, Apple delivered a compelling phone this year, the only iPhone in a long time that captured my eye (Only looking at the 7Plus). If i were to get another phone, unfortunately the iPhone would be on my list of choices. (That's all I'm saying about the iPhone matter, if you wanna ask anything else i'd be happy to answer.) Sure you could say "oh there's plenty of Android phones out there just pick one be together not the same yadayada.apk." But for me it's almost a 'Google or bust' kinda deal. There's just something about that stockish experience. "Broski just use a custom rom." I don't have time for those, I wish I did, but not anymore. I want a phone that works, that has the least worries, and has a stock experience. Galaxy's; never liked them except the SPens on the Notes (And the Note7 is dead so...) LG; I don't even know about them anymore. Motorola; A lost cause now. HTC; they died and I never liked their phones anyways. ASUS; lol. Huawei; The skins on their phones are jokes. OnePlus; They left a sour taste in my mouth once and I still can't wash it off. (Recommend me more brands please.) I'm in a divided state with Android OEM's. I love Android as an OS, never felt like I could leave it, but Google and other OEM's need to step up. No more games. They've fallen into this pit of "they'll buy it anyways so it doesn't matter" and i'd like to see the phones we used to know and love. The ones we created memories with. That's my $20. Felt like I needed to say that around other Android lovers, and what better place than the wonderful community of Android police. Hopefully I'm not the only person in the world who feels like this. If I am, well then I'm the center of the universe and OEM's need to do as I say. :) Feel free the criticize, ask questions, downvote, or ignore this comment. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ http://zxq9.com/dodcac/F13-32/tldrpowell2.jpg ItsRamiL Not really. I just didn't feel like opening a Google doc and typing and this comment box was closest so... lol My Dixie Wrecked I think you might be more at home at a cabin in the words so you can work your manifesto. Cakefish Sony maybe? ItsRamiL I've always liked their phones, but lately they've been slacking. Im eager to see what they bring to the table next year though. maverick7526 I'd have to agree. Having purchased a Nexus phone every year since the galaxy nexus I feel the same way. The pixel with all these issues, 7.1.1 basically bricking your 6P if you try to use it in the cold, this is all unacceptable. I find it hard to even consider Google as a phone manufacturer now. I would consider an iPhone. I just want a phone to work. I don't feel like putting this ROM here, swapping kernels etc. I just want a phone to work. If the pixel was priced nexus-like it wouldn't be that bad, however imagine getting this premium phone and dealing with a $900+ phone with poor camera lens alignment, speaker quality issues, and now software issues?! It's not worth the time, and most average users will dump this phone after this experience. As much as I hate Samsung and Apple I will probably get one of their phones next, or if Xiaomi decides to bring the Mi Mix to the US I'm in. It's been fun with nexii phone, however you can only beta test something for so long before you get fed up with it. Google needs better QC, and the next pixel should come out Jan 2018. Really take the time and put out a decent product, not a rushed one. ItsRamiL "you can only beta test something for so long before you get fed up with it." I like that but let me add something more. For me, another reason i liked Nexus is because i also loved beta testing Android and seeing new things. Android has matured greatly over the years and now if feels refined. Android, itself, just kinda works now. Today, though, i feel like the tables have turned. Instead of beta testing software (which broken things can be fixed with simple keystrokes,) it feels like we are beta testing the hardware (something that can't be fixed as easily.) Emil I replaced Nexus 5x with iPhone 7 three months ago. It's not acceptable to buy Pixel Phone with It's issues for the price you could buy iPhone which just works. That's makes me angry and I decide to leave Android and stick with iOS. The migration is not so bad after one week you will feel like you have iPhone for years. Don't panic about missing "Back" button It's not the problem. mattcoz Yeah, I've had some weird freezes every once in a while. If I try to press the recents button when ut is frozen, it will try to split into multi window mode. Adam Mitchell Interesting to see my screen shot used in an article. Maleko Not a good Christmas for Google... 6P shutdowns, Pixel freezes... It's the cold season :D mike shwilly Yesterday my Pixel turned off by itself and started bootlooping. Holding the power button helped. brolivar Mine freezes when watching YouTube videos. TomCos Every Nexus phone I ever owned does this Robert Andersson And people complain about EMUI. A skin that never freezes, is always snappy and is a battery champ. ggggg And is fucking ugly. Robert Andersson No, it's not. Care to comment on the outstanding battery life, the really fast processor and that it never freezes or reboots? AdamH Same with MIUI. Patrick Smithopolis How do you know it never freezes? I've never heard of EMUI being snappy or a battery champ. Robert Andersson I own a Huawei Mate 8, I know what it's like. Other users report the same. Never ever read any gate-stories about Huawei/EMUI (at least not the past 2 years). No touch disease, no bend-gate, no reboots, no nothing. Patrick Smithopolis I can make the same case. I've never experienced any software freezes so therefore the Pixel never freezes. Also, where do you complain if there are software issues for EMUI? Robert Andersson You can not make the same case. This and other similar articles (and user comments) prove the Pixel has widespread issues. EMUI has had some problems displaying notifications, but that's about it. Patrick Smithopolis This is not a widespread issue; 10s of users are complaining about it. And AP tends to focus on the Pixel issues because a large percentage of their readers have the phone and there's a forum for complaints. On the other hand EMUI is largely ignored because most of us here don't use it and there's no established place to complain about any software issue. Adam "On the other hand EMUI is largely ignored because most of us here don't use it and there's no established place to complain about any software issue." what? xda has a whole section for Huawei and Honor phones. They even did a partner ship with Honor with the Honor Hub. http://forum.xda-developers.com/honor-hub/ Anon the Honor 8, even with EMUI, performs faster than the Pixel. easily 5hrs SOT. lasts the whole day with more to spare Kwetsima Maluleke Lol ggggg Is that funny? Kwetsima Maluleke It's just ironic how these software issues happen so often with the Nexus line and now the Pixel. Almost makes you wonder what the point of these phones are. Patrick Smithopolis They're for people who want a close to stock experience, updates straight from Google and want to be the first to experience new versions of Android. Also, no phone is immune from software issues but in the case of Nexus/Pixel phones if a enough people complain about a particular issue Google will look into it. If there's a solution they will issue an update to the software. Robert Andersson The stock freeze experience.) 😉 Kwetsima Maluleke Of course no phone is without issue. You'd just expect the phones that represent stock Android not to have more software issues than LG or Samsung devices for example. givitumibeybi this made me happy. lomsha #petty lol SomeGuy112 Is there going to be a article every time "some" people have a issue with their Pixel? Bet I could find "some" people that have issues with every "premium" phone in existence on XDA and other various forums. I understand why articles about Pixel issues get much coverage though, it's a controversial phone in the Android community. Since so many "Android enthusiasts" are pissed the Pixel costs so much, mad about it's "plain" design and how it's not priced like a Nexus but yet still gets praised in reviews, lots of them want to see it fail. Making articles about every issue "some" Pixel owners have is perfect clickbait matreal for the bitter "Android enthusiasts" that want Google to return to making cheap Nexus devices, which also happen to be the main user base that visit hardcore Android websites like this. You know you're userbase well, Bravo! AsterMK Actually this site's user base has more Pixel fanboys than Pixel haters and it's not even close. VAVAMk_2 Nexus 6P user waiting happily with my phone for a much improved Pixel 2. Only gripe is 7.1.1 hurt battery on 6P. derp_cookies 7.1.1 actually fixed a lot of GPS and Bluetooth issues I was having. No noticeable battery issues either. VAVAMk_2 Battery has been worse for me on 7.1.1. abazigal Now you know how iPhone users feel. 😉 Knowledgeborn Allah Very true... 😏 abc Funny how the Pixel fanboys had no trouble with hundreds of positive Pixel articles that were published earlier. Đức Thành I partially agree: the reactions to this article are a bit overdramatic, but you know, fanboys will be fanboys and extremists who demand everything to be perfect and complain like it's the end of the world with every little problem (admittedly this particular case is a bit more than a little problem, but it's nothing like carrying an explosive Note 7 around waiting for it to blow up in people's faces) will be extremists. In my opinion Android Police is just doing their job, like they have always been doing by reporting problems like these. This is a specialized tech blog for enthusiasts, so there's no point if they don't report about things like these. I think they try their best to do their job and they do it well, but there is little they can do when it comes to the audience's reactions; so perhaps we should not place the blame on them. (This is beside the point, but maybe sometimes some of the audience are part of the problem; maybe sometimes we are part of the problem; and I think it'll benefit us all more if we could stop and reflect on ourselves first before we criticize anyone else.) navjack Oh totally. An enthusiast audience is part of the problem. Especially if said user base has only gotten top of the line phones and never lived with budget. Andrew My Nexus 6 does this regularly since 7.0 upgrade. Falcon The most optimized phone Lel ! Maff Mace Life360 were made aware of the issue and fixed it with an update a week later, don't think it's fair to finger them now when they fixed it a few weeks ago. I chatted to Google about the issue through the support built in to the Pixel, but because I bought through Carphone Warehouse (who they linked to as a place to buy from) they weren't interested in supporting me. Sir_Brizz Their support is so many circles of hell ahead of Apple and Samsung. They need to fix this if they actually want to be able to compete. Lawrence ZzzzZzz it is not freezing it is lagging. Chris Sanner I think it's software. This has been happening on my 6p since the official 7.1.1 update AtiRage The typical Nexus-like behavior. Good job Google! Mastermind Android in a nutshell. Premium price, mediocre software performance. lomsha Oh really Luxferro All of Google's products are beta, which is why they should be cheap. Bruce Wayne When are Android phones never experiencing some sort of freeze or bug? It's almost like a daily behavior at this point. Gabe Maier Please bring more attention to this , problem also affects stock Nexus (Nexus 5). It's something to do with the memory cache as clearing it offers temporary relief. I had to delete Facebook and Instagram to have a semi-functional phone. Pixel support just blames third party apps. Lawstorant Pixel was rushed and now it shows. I hope Google will step up their game because my Nexus 6 is waiting for a good successor. derp_cookies Man, has shit hit the fan for Pixel lately or what? Glad I didn't buy one... my 6P is doing fine. Nick Schiwy just sayin' http://www.androidpolice.com/2016/12/20/some-nexus-6ps-have-developed-a-battery-early-shutoff-problem-and-its-becoming-a-safety-issue/ my Pixel is doing fine too :) derp_cookies Not surprising to see at least 1 article about every phone with some problem. The 6P isn't as headline-catching as the Note 7 or Pixel though ;) makapav Yes, I'm facing these freezes as well. I thought they were app related but the last one caused a reboot. Darren Whats that google tap in the screen shot? b0b Wake me up when battery explodes. Rod I'm mildly interested in that wallpaper. Polarbehr What is the wallpaper in the main picture. Mikel Pr Life360 was causing me issues too about a month or two ago (nexus 6P tho) K77bkny It wouldn't be Google without its usual beta bullshit... krudl3rx I cannot for the life of me get my Amazon Drive to properly show all my files. Tried deleting cache and data, reinstall, etc. and still only a very few files will show, along with a bunch of empty files. *sigh* Michael Hannigan Come on. Let's be serious. We all know it's one shitty app causing the problem. MikeOxlong This makes me laugh. While I like the pixel software changes/updates, the hardware is way too bleh to warrant it's pricing structure. On top of that I have the full software experience of the pixel rubbing on my n6p without hiccups, and it actually runs ever so slightly better/smoother than the pixel XL I've compared it with. Lol google. SAM What do they say? Buttery smooth.. ? In Fla High priced junk is still junk. Jason B I'm not a fan of the Pixel. Hardware-wise, you know, the one thing you CAN'T change, it's a total disappointment like it was slapped together at the last minute (after finding out Huawei backed out, it might be somewhat true). The blue version is just shockingly ugly. I hope the next one knocks it out of the park, but considering Google's ADHD, it might end up worse than before. I expect the best from Google, and this isn't it. Ramon This has happened on my Nexus 6P yesterday. Don't have that app installed either. Have a video of it. likurges pixel owners aka google beta testers Hemang Bhavasar Google is giving worst service... They lost faith. I am having a lost of different problem like, having signal 📶 noise, 🔥 problems when signals fluctuating etc. But Google is not taking any responsibility. Shame on Google. thereasoner My Pixel has been fantastic, no complaints with the exception of my trucks audio system randomly switching over to the Pixel on its own while I'm listening to talk radio. Not sure if the trucks system or the Pixel is to blame for that. Overall I think the Pixels have been well received. The issues being reported are isolated, quite minor and fixable when compared to the problems from iPhones currently and over the years. Nee Austin I've only ran into the audio bug at full volume when I ran those very specific videos. In other words who cares? It's good someone ran across a bug and identified it, but some perspective would be helpful. I know.. Impossible when 'a user' had a lock up on a *gasp* pixel by *gasp* Google. So let's return to stories about exploits of millions of Russian phones running pirated games. el hi this will be fixed in the next update el hi Refi notice:http://treegreat.com/RLI=1-UI=1-OI=11166-II=2612120-IDE=380568-MID=1067-FID=79236 el hi one best android phones in 2016 navjack From a Moto g 1st gen on republic wireless to the pixel on fi I have to say that this phone is premium. No issues with it, I can actually multi task without apps closing in the background. I use the multi user function in the OS a ton. The CPU benchmarks quite fast and in real world it performs perfectly. Hadi Satrio With that price tag, one would expect Google to already gave up its habit of beta-testing products on the fly. 🤷 Sid I haven't faced any problems with my Pixel. Been using it since October end and its still flying. My wife loves mine over her iphone7. Definitely an happy user, will get Pixel 3 breon I hate to jump on the 'me too' bandwagon, but I've been having this issue since updating to 7.1.1. I get random freeze by getting directions with Google Maps, watching a video on YouTube, swiping between home screens. Rebooting doesn't seem to help. In fact it seems to freeze more frequently after a boot. I've reset the phone with no luck. I'm at the point now where I only have 3 non-Google apps on the phone. I'm going to start adding more over time to see if it was a rogue app. Even if it is an app misbehaving, the Android OS shouldn't allow it to hijack and freeze the entire phone, it should kill the app. Whatever happened to the ol' force close screen? HeyRadar Still glad I went with the Moto Z instead. Same hardware with no muss, no fuss, and way cheaper. dcdttu Just a friendly update: I've uninstalled Life360 for 2 weeks not and it's not locked up / rebooted once. This is on 2 different Pixels, btw. It's totally Life360 doing it to me. Mike J I purchased my Pixel because I read the reviews and wanted a phone that was reliable. I use it for work, I rely on my phone to make money. What I got was disappointment. After about 4 weeks the phone would randomly shut down, sometimes I would get calls and I couldn't hear the other person. Then one day it just became unusable. No sound during a call but I could see the call was connected. Hard reset didn't work, and I was working with a google tech support person without any luck. I had to get a replacement sent to me. Now I'm a few months into my replacement pixel and I'm still not satisfied. I never had these reliability issues with my Samsung S5. I've had this phone tell me my phone app isn't responding, I woke up one morning late because the alarm didn't go off. It was hooked to a charger like usual at night and just shut down. The power on button didn't start it and I had to use the hard reset to get it going. Lots of times it just freezes for a while. I must restart this phone about every other day to keep it running correctly. When I play back voicemail, the playback is choppy and it kind of jumps back a second or two during the message so it sounds like stuttering. Hard to explain but very annoying. I use a bluetooth earpiece because I drive and work while talking on the phone. sometimes when I make a call it will drop my bluetooth device after dialing the number and I have to pay attention and make sure i'm still connected in case I need to grab the phone and talk directly into it so I don't make the person I'm calling wonder and wait why I'm not talking to them. I only load the minimum apps I need because I'm afraid I'll load something that will interfere with the phone. I search once in a while for others that may have similar issues but I have trouble finding anything bad online about the phone. How is it such a great phone has given me so many problems and I'm on my second one???

Tech Industry by Dara Kerr May 19, 2017 3:31 PM PDT @darakerr Anthony Levandowski speaks to the press during last September's launch of Uber's self-driving cars. Angelo Merendino/Getty Images Uber appears to be distancing itself from Anthony Levandowski, its star self-driving car engineer, who's at the center of a lawsuit filed against the company by Waymo. In the suit, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet, accuses Levandowski of stealing 14,000 "highly confidential" files on driverless car technology. In a strongly worded letter to Levandowski, Uber's head of legal, Salle Yoo, said he needs to return any stolen files or testify under oath that he never took them. And if he doesn't agree, Uber may fire him. "If you fail to comply in a material manner," Yoo wrote in the letter, written Monday but made public late Thursday, "then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment." Yoo emphasizes in the letter that Uber is required to take these steps to comply with a court order in the lawsuit. The legal battle pits two of Silicon Valley's most-watched companies against each other. Between the two, Uber has more to lose. Google has built a massive search business and has its hands in everything from online ad sales to Wi-Fi to social media. Uber, on the other hand, has a more limited business model. It's built a ride-hailing empire, but it's betting on self-driving cars to be the future of its company. While Waymo's suit focuses on the actions of Levandowski, the case is against Uber. Waymo alleges that Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal designs for its self-driving car tech. Levandowski used to work at Google but quit in January 2016 to form his own self-driving truck startup, called Otto. Uber bought Otto last August for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car program. Uber has called Waymo's claims "baseless" and argues that its technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. Complicating matters is the fact that Levandowski has pleaded the Fifth. The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects individuals against self-incrimination. This means he's been able to refuse to answer questions about the alleged file theft or turn over his personal laptop. Related stories Waymo v. Uber brawl sees 'suspicious' acts, 'pilfered files' Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Uber says it's not 'hiding anything' in Waymo case Uber doesn't dispute that Levandowski downloaded the 14,000 files (though it claims none of those documents entered its servers). Federal Judge William Alsup, who's presiding over the case, agrees with Waymo that something "highly suspicious" happened. Alsup issued a ruling Monday ordering Uber to return any purloined documents to Waymo by May 31. He also formerly barred Levandowski from working on Uber's lidar, which is the laser technology used in self-driving cars that Levandowski helped pioneer at Google. "While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court's order requires us to make these demands of you," Yoo wrote in her letter.

The researchers used “fancy machine learning” to eliminate human biases and come up with a scientific way to determine criminality by examining facial features, University of Washington professor Carl Bergstrom told his class in Mary Gates Hall one day last month. “What do you guys think?” Bergstrom asked. In unison, more than 100 students responded out loud: “Bulls—!” Exactly. Biology professor Bergstrom and Information School professor Jevin West are co-teaching a seminar this quarter that’s all about BS — or, precisely, “Calling BS in the Age of Big Data.” The 10-week seminar class has achieved the academic version of a chart-topping pop single: At the UW, it reached its 160-student capacity shortly after registration opened this spring. Its reach across the globe is even more impressive. Colleges in Canada, France, Portugal, England and Australia have contacted the professors about teaching a version of the course this fall. A partial list: Carnegie Mellon University, Hofstra College, Iowa State University, Stanford University, Columbia University, UCLA, Oxford University (England), Universite de Nantes (France), Murdoch University (Australia), University of Guelph (Canada) and Instituto Piaget (Portugal). Currently, a Catholic high-school teacher in Minnesota and a tech college in Copenhagen are teaching the course, and the University of Alaska Anchorage will teach it this fall. The course syllabus is freely available, as are YouTube videos of the lectures. West and Bergstrom are especially enthusiastic about helping high school teachers use the BS course materials to develop classes. “Ultimately, that’s very important to us, because this is material that shouldn’t wait until your senior year of college,” West said. The professors attracted widespread attention by using a profanity in the title of the course, but the interest is real. So far, the first video of their class lecture has been viewed more than 12,000 times. Calling BS is not a class about fake news, and it’s not a political science course. Rather, the professors want students to develop a skeptical eye about big data and its limitations, particularly in the sciences. They’re teaching how to recognize results that are just too good to be true. In their fifth lecture, Bergstrom and West explored why Google’s much-vaunted ability to predict a flu outbreak turned out to be, well, BS. They picked apart the Chinese criminality project. They examined the mystery of why — with the exception of Sept. 11 — the 11th day of the month is referenced less frequently in books and literature than almost any other day of the month, at least as measured in a Google book-scanning project.(Think you know the answer? Read to the end.) One of their main themes: If the data collected for use in an analysis isn’t solid, the result won’t be, either. “Garbage in, garbage out,” West told the class. In the case of the algorithm that claimed to predict criminality, the Chinese researchers used pictures of incarcerated and innocent people to create a mathematical formula to identify people in each category. But, as Bergstrom noted, the non-criminals were wearing faint smiles; the criminals had subtle frowns etched into their faces. “I have this hypothesis that this is a smile detector,” he told the class. As for Google Flu Trends — Google’s instantaneous map of influenza hot spots, created using the geographic locations of searches for flu-like symptoms — the company appeared to be predicting outbreaks as much as two weeks faster than the Centers for Disease Control, which relied on confirmed reports of influenza from doctors and medical centers. “When I read this article, I remember taking it to my class and saying, ‘Big data really is amazing,'” West said. “Big data is changing the world.” But Google Flu Trends soon became the poster child of big-data hubris and overreach, West said. As time ticked along, researchers realized that the tracker was overestimating flu cases most of the time, and in one case, overestimated it by more than 50 percent. “In fact, what they found is that if you just took a simple model, like tracking the temperature, it would do a better job” of predicting flu outbreaks, West said. The two professors bring a sense of humor to their lectures. “We’re making it fun — making it entertaining, theatrical, to make it less intimidating,” West said. Because the class is made up of students from 40 different majors, the material is short on technical detail and long on developing a common-sense BS detector. Next fall, Calling BS will be offered as a three-credit course at the UW, and the professors hope to include guest speakers — climatologists and doctors, for example – along with videos from experts across campus who can talk about what BS looks like in their fields. “I want to tell them meaningful stories in the class, that they’ll tell people after dinner,” Bergstrom said. “These are the conversations we want to start.” They’re also making available a sanitized version of their materials (which uses the word “bull” instead of BS) that could be used in middle or high school. And they’re hopeful that a new law Gov. Jay Inslee signed last month, which encourages schools to teach media literacy, will draw teachers to their site. As for why the 11th day of the month is so infrequently referenced in scanned texts: Google’s algorithm confused the number 11 with other look-alike characters – capital Is, lowercase ls, even the letter n — and often failed to recognize the number in the books it scanned.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock Android O’s most exciting new feature is a total game-changer Chris Smith @chris_writes May 19th, 2017 at 6:11 PM Share Tweet Google shared more details about its next major Android release during its opening keynote at Google I/O 2017. There are many user-facing features that Android fans will appreciate, but also several under-the-hood changes that should make Android even better in the coming years. One of them was actually unveiled a few days before Google’s developer event kicked off, and Google only mentioned it briefly during the event. But Project Treble is an amazing trick, at least in theory, that could finally fix one of Google’s most annoying Android problems. In the process, the feature might make the Google Pixel even better than it already is. Don't Miss: The best new features in Android O have nothing to do with Android O Project Treble doesn’t sound too exciting, and some Android users might not even care about it. But it’s the one thing Google should have developed years ago to fix Android fragmentation. What Google wants to do with Android going forward is to separate the underlying Android operating system from the ‘Vendor interface’ that contains all the low-level software and drivers. This code modularity would allow Google to issue Android updates much faster to more devices, not just Nexus and Pixel phones. Of all the current phones that are going to be updated to Android O after Google releases the new operating system, only the Pixel will take advantage of Project Treble. What that actually means is that Google might update the phone even after the mandatory two-year period for software updates expires. Image Source: Google The news came at Google I/O, Android Police reports, where Google’s VP of engineering for Android confirmed that current Pixel models will work with Project Treble. This also means that some of the hottest Android phones currently available in stores, including the Galaxy S8, will not get Project Treble support. The Pixel series is the only exception, which means that Google is fixing fragmentation, but the fix only applies to devices that run at least Android O or newer out of the box (other than the Pixel). That said, you shouldn’t get too excited about your Pixel getting updates well beyond the two-year mark. Just because Google can do it doesn’t mean it will. Also, it’s likely that in two years time, you’ll want to replace the Pixel with something newer since typically only savvy Android fans buy Pixels.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

USA TODAY Jessica Guynn , USA TODAY , KPNX 7:09 PM. MST May 19, 2017 Google CEO Sundar Pichai at Google I/O (Photo: Google) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. — Google's mission is to steer people to the information they need in their daily lives. One crucial area the Internet giant says could use some work: Jobs. So Google is launching a new initiative, Google for Jobs, that includes a feature in search that collects and organizes millions of job postings from all over the web to make them easier for job seekers to find. In coming weeks, a Google search for a cashier job in Des Moines or a software engineering gig in Boise will pop up job openings at the top of search results. With Google for Jobs, job hunters will be able to explore the listings across experience and wage levels by industry, category and location, refining these searches to find full or part-time roles or accessibility to public transportation. Google is determined to crack the code on matching available jobs with the right candidates, CEO Sundar Pichai said during his keynote address Wednesday at Google's annual I/O conference for software developers here. "The challenge of connecting job seekers to better information on job availability is like many search challenges we’ve solved in the past," he said. Pichai says he hopes Google's new job search function will surface new opportunities for job seekers who often don't know there's a job opening "right next door." A Google for Jobs search for open barista positions. (Photo: Google) Google is the latest Silicon Valley company to announce an effort to boost American jobs after President Donald Trump's call to put America first. The aggressive push into jobs could help Google attract even more employment-related advertising. Already, it's expected to pull in three-quarters of search ad spending in the U.S. this year, according to research firm eMarketer. It's also another example of the consumer-centric company's dive into the corporate sector as it hunts for new revenue sources beyond advertising. Anytime an 800-pound gorilla like Google enters a market, it sends shudders through the established players in the targeted industry. Google's leap into travel search was a game changer for the travel booking industry. In job search, the heavyweight is Indeed, which says it's the largest job search engine, with more than 20 million job postings and 200 million unique visitors a month. "We are happy to see that 13 years after Indeed launched, Google has woken up to the fact that searching for jobs is one of the most important searches in anyone’s life,"  Indeed President Chris Hyams told USA TODAY. Other job-search companies — such as Monster and CareerBuilder — are partnering with Google, an unusual amount of cooperation from its competitors. Google scours the web, pulling from a broad cross-section of job listings, including from Glassdoor, Facebook, LinkedIn and ZipRecruiter. The aim is to "increase the efficiency of job matching," said Nick Zakrasek, a product manager for Google search, who gave USA TODAY a first look at the new search results job seekers will soon see. Job seekers who find a listing via Google search are then taken to the company or job-search site listing, where they can apply. Google for Jobs could prove useful to Americans whose economic anxiety is growing despite low unemployment rates, as more jobs are being displaced by technological advances, increased automation and spreading globalization. Google is very much a part of those advances: It's charting an artificial intelligence-powered future that promises to radically transform how people earn a living in the years ahead. "Google’s always looking at new things it can do with the skill set it has, and particularly ways it can get deeper into search and deeper into enterprises," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst with Jackdaw Research. "Jobs is a good fit for both of those, where it can provide a custom or deep search function for job listings on the consumer side and also offer businesses a system to hire workers on the enterprise side." For employers, identifying the right candidates can be daunting, with nearly half of U.S. companies saying they face challenges in filling open positions. On the employer front with Google for Jobs, Google is selling artificial intelligence and search technology to companies to make make it easier for them to find qualified recruits on their websites and job boards, Pichai says. In November, Google launched a piece of that technology — Clouds Jobs API, which employers access through Google Cloud. The pilot program with FedEx, Johnson & Johnson, Health South and CareerBuilder is being expanded to include more than 30 employers, job boards and staffing agencies, he said. "It’s still early days, but we've seen promising results," Pichai said. For example, since using the Cloud Jobs API, Johnson & Johnson has found that 18% of job seekers are more likely to apply for a job on the company's career site, he said.

Facebook says it launched its own jobs feature to ease the strain of job searches on its nearly 2 billion users. "This partnership with Google helps us accomplish that goal," Facebook product manager Gaurav Dosi said in a statement. Google for Jobs is good for the American economy and "has the potential to radically improve discovery of the millions of jobs on LinkedIn," Dan Shapero, vice president of careers and talent at LinkedIn, said in a statement.

A search for teaching jobs on Google for Jobs. (Photo: Google) Frustrations  For many job seekers, applying for jobs online can feel like tossing a resume into a fathomless digital abyss. Google says millions of people each day start their hunt for jobs on its search engine. But finding the right job can be a lot trickier than Googling the next movie times. Job posts are notoriously hard for search engines to classify because of the wide range of keywords used to describe job functions and inconsistency across industries and organizations in job titles. And many people have very specific requirements for the job they are seeking, such as location, accessibility to public transit and special skills. "It's something we see in the search logs. We see signs of our users being frustrated and being stressed while they're doing job seeking queries," he said. How it works For example, when conducting a search for sales jobs in Raleigh, North Carolina, openings will soon begin to appear at the top of results. A job seeker can narrow the search by applying filters, such as jobs posted in the last three days, entry level versus management roles, full-time roles versus part-time, and roles in a particular industry such as retail. Once a job seeker spots something promising, they can click through to the website where the listing is hosted and apply there. The goal for Google is to provide a comprehensive set of job postings that include blue-collar and white-collar positions, Zakrasek said. Google will also be able to point job seekers to jobs that have typically been much harder to search for and classify such as retail and service jobs. He recently received a thank you note from the brother of a Google engineer who found a job using the feature while it was being tested. "This guy had done computer repair, which means opening a computer box and fiddling with the wiring. It's kind of a dying job in this day and age and he had had trouble finding work," says Zakrasek. With Google for Jobs,  "he was able to find a position he hadn't seen anywhere else."

There were many new features announced that will enhance our day-to-day life, while (hopefully) making the lives of developers a bit easier, and improving our mobile devices ten-fold. To close out the show, Google has decided to share a list of all of the announcements that were made during the Keynote and various sessions that took place. We went through the list and cherry-picked some of the highlights, so without further adieu, here’s what Google I/O 2017 brought everyone. Google Assistant and Google Home Soon, with Google Lens—a new way for computers to “see”—you’ll be able to learn more about and take action on the things around you, while you’re in a conversation with your Assistant. We’ve brought your Google Assistant to iPhones. Call me maybe? With new hands-free calling on Google Home, you’ll be able to make calls with the Assistant to landlines and mobile numbers in U.S. and Canada for free. You can now type to your Google Assistant on eligible Android phones and iPhones. For developers, we’re bringing Actions on Google to the Assistant on phones—on both Android and iOS. Soon you’ll find conversation apps for the Assistant that help you do things like shopping for clothes or ordering food from a lengthy menu. AI, ML, and Cloud With the addition of Smart Reply to Gmail on Android and iOS, we’re using machine learning to make responding to emails easier for more than a billion Gmail users. With Google.ai, we’re pulling all our AI initiatives together to put more powerful computing tools and research in the hands of researchers, developers and companies. We’ve already seen promising research in the fields of pathology and DNA research. We must go deeper. AutoML uses neural nets to design neural nets, potentially cutting down the time-intensive process of setting up an AI system, and helping non-experts build AI for their particular needs. We introduced a new Google Cloud Platform service called Google Cloud IoT Core, which makes it easy for Google Cloud customers to gain business insights through secure device connections to our rich data and analytics tools. Google Photos We first launched Google Photos two years ago, and now it has more than 500 million monthly users. Soon Google Photos will give you sharing suggestions by selecting the right photos, and suggesting who you should send them to based on who was in them. Shared libraries will let you effortlessly share photos with a specific person. You can share your full photo library, or photos of certain people or from a certain date forward. Google Lens is coming to Photos later this year, so you’ll be able to look back on your photos to learn more or take action—like find more information about a painting from a photo you took in a museum. Android and Google Play We reached 2 billion monthly active devices on Android! Android O, coming later this year, is getting improvements to “vitals” like battery life and performance, and bringing more fluid experiences to your smaller screen, from improved notifications to autofill. Smart text selection in Android O improves copy and paste to recognize entities on the screen—like a complete address—so you can easily select text with a double tap, and even bring up an app like Maps to help navigate you there. We previewed a new initiative aimed at getting computing into the hands of more people on entry-level Android devices. Internally called Android Go, it’s designed to be relevant for people who have limited data connectivity and speak multiple languages. Android Auto is now supported by 300 car models, and Android Auto users have grown 10x since last year. Android Instant Apps are now open to all developers, so anyone can build and publish apps that can be run without requiring installation. Virtual and Augmented Reality More Daydream-ready phones are coming soon, including the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+, LG’s next flagship phone, and devices from Motorola and ASUS. We’re expanding Daydream to support standalone VR headsets, which don’t require a phone or PC. HTC VIVE and Lenovo are both working on devices, based on a Qualcomm reference design. The next smartphone with Tango technology will be the ASUS ZenFone AR, available this summer. We previewed Euphrates, the latest release of Daydream, which will let you capture what you’re seeing and cast your virtual world right onto the screen in your living room, coming later this year. We’re releasing an experimental build of Chromium with an augmented reality API, to help bring AR to the web YouTube Soon you’ll be able to watch and control 360-degree YouTube videos and live streams on your TV, and use your game controller or remote to pan around an immersive experience. Super Chat lets fans interact directly with YouTube creators during live streams by purchasing highlighted chat messages that stay pinned to the top of the chat window. We previewed a developer integration that showed how the Super Chat API can be used to trigger actions in the real world—such as turning the lights on and off in a creator’s apartment. A new feature in the YouTube VR app will soon let people watch and discuss videos together. Developer-Focused Updates With a new Google Payment API, developers can enable easy in-app or online payments for customers who already have credit and debit cards stored on Google properties. We’re bringing phone number authentication to Firebase, working closely with the Fabric Digits team, so your users can sign in to your apps with their phone numbers. We’re expanding Firebase Hosting to integrate with Cloud Functions, letting you can do things like send a notification when a user signs up or automatically create thumbnails when an image is uploaded to Cloud Storage. AdMob is also now integrated with Google Analytics for Firebase, giving developers a complete picture of ads revenue, mediation revenue and in-app purchase revenue in one place. Developers interested in testing the cutting edge of our products can now sign up for a Firebase Alpha program. That’s all folks.

It’s an annual event where the giant shows off the best they’ve got cooking. And throughout the show, one theme has been clear — Google loves AI and wants you on board. Google made its billions by being the people’s search engine. While it was far from the first, more robust algorithms and software helped the company build an empire. Now it’s looking to take the next step and replicate past success, this time, by mastering AI. Machine learning, cloud computing, etc. are the way of the future. They can already best humans in all kinds of tasks, and the exponential speed of development shows no signs of letting up. A good chunk of that progress can be attributed to Google’s TensorFlow software — one of the most advanced AI tools available. It’s so useful; it’s practically ubiquitous. “There’s hardly a way around TensorFlow these days,” Samim Winiger, head of machine learning design studio Samim.io, told The Verge. “I use a lot of open source learning libraries, but there’s been a major shift to TensorFlow.” The software works wonders. It’s fast, scalable, and effective, plus it integrates into Google’s own cloud services so that you can easily take advantage of the tech giant’s server farms for storage or computing power. And the company has an array of specialized chips that mimic neural networks and work well with the kind of parallelized software that AI and machine learning use. Everyone, of course, is at least working on AI. Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook, all have their own tools and services and software, but Google’s ease of use, and willingness to buy up third party competitors and integrate those systems and techniques into their own have allowed them to subsume just about everyone else in the game. And that mean’s the search giant is leap-frogging just about everyone else. The Android Now personal assistant now has two billion monthly users — a significant chunk of the planet’s internet users. Plus, Google has no qualms about launching their services on rival platforms. We may not have heard too much from the Big G in a while, but it’s clear the company’s been hard at work fighting the next major battle for tech dominance years before everyone else.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

The Google Home app now features customizable user-defined shortcuts for Assistant Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/17 2:03pm PDTMay 17, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 65 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News One of the draws of having a personal assistant is being able to control various things through it. Alexa is popular partially for this reason and Google Home/Assistant has been slowly catching up since its launch. Just a few weeks ago, our very own Cody noticed that Google was implementing direct support for IFTTT in the Google app for user-defined actions. Well, this has finally appeared in the Home app in a "Shortcuts" menu in the Assistant section. These customizable user-defined shortcuts are very basic and anyone familiar with IFTTT will feel right at home (heh). The trigger is the "Ok Google, [blank]" phrase that you define, which activates a service like opening Google Play Music or sending a specific text to a certain contact. The best part? Not having to use the IFTTT website to manage your applets.   If you haven't taken up Tasker/AutoVoice/Assistant yet, this is a good way to get started. I am not sure if this is a server-side switch or an app update (I only noticed it this afternoon), but it's super cool nonetheless.

Interesting! But no IFTTT account required I guess, because I created a Todoist shortcut and didn't see any applets added to my IFTTT account on the web. Plus, invoking the shortcut just opens up the Todoist chat interface within the Assistant app, where it takes me through the normal workflow. Jordan Palmer Same. bozzykid Are we sure it is actually using IFTTT? Perhaps they just used ifttt in the UI elements since it is copying their features. XerBlade Considering all this is really doing is remapping Assistant commands to custom phrases (so it can't be used to do anything Assistant can't already do natively, plus you can't give it any variable phrases), I'm pretty sure this has absolutely nothing to do with IFTTT. Seriously, this does one thing and one thing only. You say one custom phrase, and it remaps it to a different phrase and acts as if you said that. tu3218 I just tried this and I don't get it. I selected the voice triggers but I don't see anywhere to actually select the service and the devices that I want to activate based on my command. What am I missing? Alex S it's literally just sending the command directly to assistant, just like if you said it outloud. It's just a way to shorten the command. tu3218 Hmm okay. I tried one and it worked. I see there's an option to turn up the TV. But it said I hadn't linked my Harmony account yet. I went to add devices but don't see Harmony. Seems like we're making progress. bozzykid Harmony is already available at least in the US. tu3218 Nothing here on my end. I am in the US. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac7833390bcfeeef1844da6dbc20fc821f9a520d1b90b7b52c870faa3fcf10d.jpg bozzykid You are looking in the wrong place. Its under Assistant Apps. It has been available for months. create812 "It's just a way to shorten the command." This is the real take away here. Alex S A few things: A) It's SUPER specific and only recognizes the EXACT phrase you say. For example if you put "Good night" but assistant picks it up as "goodnight" it won't work. B) You can map multiple key phrases to one action but you cannot match multiple actions to one (or more) key phrases. Not sure why? This actually kind of sucks, because there's really no point to using shortcuts if you can't have multiple actions in one key phrase. Otherwise, why not just ask Google Assistant what you want directly? C) Is the menu broken for anyone else? If I switch to a different app then switch back to the Google Home at it duplicates the examples so the list gets twice as long, then three times, etc. Weird! bozzykid It also only recognizes commands formatted properly. If I have "Ask harmony..." it fails but if I input it as "Ask Harmony..." it works fine. Alex S yea that doesn't bug me as much as some of the other stuff like not being able to do two commands at once. don't really see what the point of this is right now? it's cool you can make commands shorter, though. bozzykid It is great for Harmony because saying "Hey Google, Ask Harmony to turn up the volume" is a bit ridiculous. At least I might actually use my Home for Harmony commands now. Amandafpotter Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Midnitte "The trigger is the "Ok Google, [blank]" phrase that you define, which activates a service like opening Google Play Music or sending a specific text to a certain contact. The best part? Not having to use the IFTTT website to manage your applets." When are they going to add the reverse? I want to be able to trigger the command "Hey Google, catch me up" remotely from something like dismissing my alarm. :/ Any other solution is either too convoluted, clunky, or unreliable. Austin Spangrud Biggest issue that I have is the response back from Google assistant. I have my garage door setup so when I state open garage door, assistant responds with ok opening garage door. But since my garage door is set up as a switch it says turning off garage door. I just want a custom response back. Dammit Google!! Ifttt will let me do it! Jason Creating a custom response is so much fun especially when showing off your little toy to your friends. Alfonso Surroca Sounds like IFTTT is still superior to Shortcuts, since you're able to write custom OK Google responses. "Turning off garage door" sounds annoying. Michael Rodgers I'm a bit confused. These settings are in Assistant, but they're only to be used in Google Home? iantrich No, any instance of Google Assistant. Google Home just happens to be the app that has such settings Chronocento Does this work with third party actions? Like, can you bind "OK Google, ask AutoVoice [something]" to "Ok Google, do [something]"? iantrich Yes. One of their examples is for the Harmony 3rd party action João Dias Yes, actually! :) Check here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_lPWf-KR9M Chronocento Uao, a reply from João himself! :D Thanks for your great work, I love your AutoApps!!! create812 Anyone else notice how this year's I/O roll outs have gone much smoother and quicker than years past? I'm running Android O beta with little fuss, and have access to features as I hear about them (including these Assistant shortcuts). These are good times. Jerry Palmer How do I share shortcuts and home devices with other users? I have a bunch of shortcuts set up for Harmony. However, my wife is unable to activate them with her voice because we have multiple users setup and none of the shortcuts or home control devices show up in the Home app or Google Assistant for her. Tj Hariharan Google needs to powerup their voice commands, they can so easily make it more powerful than IFTTT - by offering up a way to one one-to-many or many-to-one voice commands and some automations as well. Heck home automation could be built into android and assistant. (things like location and time of day etc). As it stands IFTTT still can't do "if i'm home AND it's after sunset turn my lights on".

Podcasts & Newsletter Service Teaching German Teaching German DW im Unterricht Unterrichtsreihen Deutschlehrer-Info Germany World Business Science Environment Culture Sports TOP STORIES News How Google envisions the future of journalism From the prospect of innovation to the challenges of the industry, Google has offered an optimistic prognosis for journalism. DW caught up with Google's head of publishing and news in Europe to discuss the details. With the proliferation of new technologies threatening to upend journalism as we know it, news outlets have concerned themselves with how to reinvent their existence online. DW caught up with Gerrit Rabenstein, who heads Google's strategic partnerships, publishing and news in Europe, at the International Press Institute's World Congress to discuss how technology can help shape the future of journalism in a positive way. Deutsche Welle: How do you envision the future of journalism? I see so many new initiatives at the grassroots level that are extremely colorful and very innovative, and sometimes trying to go deep and far. I'm extremely optimistic we will find new ways. Those ways will look different than the ways we do news business today, the ways legacy players do today. But I'm sure that from this new wave of journalistic makers, new ideas will emerge. How do you envision Google's role in facilitating this future for journalism? We are participating with small and big startups, institutions and academics within the Digital News Initiative in a discussion about the future of journalism. We are engaging there in a discussion about new business models, about new ways of distributing content. In the discussion with the news industry, we are one player among others. Journalists play a role, publishers play a role, tech companies play a role. We'd love to see more tech companies engaging in this discussion, because I honestly and seriously only believe that we can solve the problems facing the industry if we come together and think from our different perspectives on this hard nut to crack: What does sustainable journalism look like in the future? Google Head of Strategic Relations Gerrit Rabenstein What are the challenges to bringing about this future Google is helping to build? The challenge for the news ecosystem is that the changes taking place in the industry are happening so incredibly fast. We went from print to digital, from digital to mobile. Tomorrow, the topic will be machine learning. So you have to build your news production company a new engine while its still running. The challenges don't get smaller. The challenges remain, or even increase or accelerate. In this complex world for news, there is no single silver bullet. The answer will be addressed very precisely for one player, and each player has to find the answer that fits for him or her. Concerning so-called "fake news," which many in the industry have seen as an existential threat, how does Google tackle this problem? We work on the topic of false news or misinformation at various ends. Internally, we updated our guidelines and made them much more strict. We launched something called the "fact check" label, which is open source software that a publisher can add to an article, a fact-checked article, and we can better surface that to an asked question. We also updated our rater guidelines so that the folks who have a second look at the quality of search results can better understand what would be a good search result for a certain query. At the same time, we are also working with external partners. We are partners of the First Draft coalition of 2015, which is an open forum to engage in the verification of content. We worked with the First Draft organization and many publications during the French presidential election, and now we're working with them on the German parliamentary election. We also engage with the topic of misinformation at the Digital News Initiative fund. We fund 25 projects that were established in 2015 and 2016, way before it became a major topic of public interest. We support those projects that tackle misinformation and hate speech from their different perspectives. So we tackle it both internally and externally. If you could say one thing to journalists, what would you say? Don't ask "why," ask "why not. " We all have to open up our minds to the possibilities and chances that are out there. I'm not saying there aren't challenges. I'm completely aware that it's very difficult, but we can overcome them if we ask: "Why don't we try this?" Let's give it a try. Gerret Rabenstein is the Head of Strategic Partnerships, News and Publishing at Google. He supports Google's partners in Germany, Austria and Switzerland as part of the newly founded Digital News Initiative.

Naturally, with Google I/O taking place after this big “leak”, there was bound to be some type of response by Google and it came from Google’s VP of engineering for Android, Dave Burke. During yesterday’s Android Fireside Chat, Burke was asked “how does Fuchsia relate to Android”, leaving a lot of us sitting on the edge of our seats. However, the answer was what you would expect from someone speaking on behalf of Google. Here’s his answer in full: How do you spell Fuchsia? Fuchsia is an early stage experimental project. We, you know, we actually have lots of cool early projects at Google. I think what’s interesting here is its open source, so people can see it and comment on it. Like lots of early stage projects it’s gonna probably pivot and morph. There’s some really smart people on it, people we’ve worked with who are great. and so, kind of exciting to see what happens. But it’s definitely a diff– sort of independent project to Android. and yeah, that’s basically it. In summary, it’s another open-source Google side project that will likely never see the light of day. Or Burke could have just been trying to throw everyone off the scent of something bigger in the works. It’s also important to note that Fuchsia has been in the works for the better part of 6 months, but a working APK gave everyone some excitement, but don’t get your hopes up. Either way, this is the best non-answer that you’re going to get for now. So let us know in the comments what you actually think Fuchsia could be morphed into, whether it be for our mobile devices or something else.

Tech Industry by Dara Kerr May 19, 2017 3:31 PM PDT @darakerr Anthony Levandowski speaks to the press during last September's launch of Uber's self-driving cars. Angelo Merendino/Getty Images Uber appears to be distancing itself from Anthony Levandowski, its star self-driving car engineer, who's at the center of a lawsuit filed against the company by Waymo. In the suit, Waymo, the self-driving car unit of Google parent company Alphabet, accuses Levandowski of stealing 14,000 "highly confidential" files on driverless car technology. In a strongly worded letter to Levandowski, Uber's head of legal, Salle Yoo, said he needs to return any stolen files or testify under oath that he never took them. And if he doesn't agree, Uber may fire him. "If you fail to comply in a material manner," Yoo wrote in the letter, written Monday but made public late Thursday, "then Uber will take adverse employment action against you, which may include termination of your employment." Yoo emphasizes in the letter that Uber is required to take these steps to comply with a court order in the lawsuit. The legal battle pits two of Silicon Valley's most-watched companies against each other. Between the two, Uber has more to lose. Google has built a massive search business and has its hands in everything from online ad sales to Wi-Fi to social media. Uber, on the other hand, has a more limited business model. It's built a ride-hailing empire, but it's betting on self-driving cars to be the future of its company. While Waymo's suit focuses on the actions of Levandowski, the case is against Uber. Waymo alleges that Uber colluded with Levandowski to steal designs for its self-driving car tech. Levandowski used to work at Google but quit in January 2016 to form his own self-driving truck startup, called Otto. Uber bought Otto last August for $680 million and named Levandowski head of its self-driving car program. Uber has called Waymo's claims "baseless" and argues that its technology is "fundamentally different" from Waymo's. Complicating matters is the fact that Levandowski has pleaded the Fifth. The US Constitution's Fifth Amendment protects individuals against self-incrimination. This means he's been able to refuse to answer questions about the alleged file theft or turn over his personal laptop. Related stories Waymo v. Uber brawl sees 'suspicious' acts, 'pilfered files' Waymo vs. Uber lawsuit: 10 things you need to know Uber says it's not 'hiding anything' in Waymo case Uber doesn't dispute that Levandowski downloaded the 14,000 files (though it claims none of those documents entered its servers). Federal Judge William Alsup, who's presiding over the case, agrees with Waymo that something "highly suspicious" happened. Alsup issued a ruling Monday ordering Uber to return any purloined documents to Waymo by May 31. He also formerly barred Levandowski from working on Uber's lidar, which is the laser technology used in self-driving cars that Levandowski helped pioneer at Google. "While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court's order requires us to make these demands of you," Yoo wrote in her letter. "We insist that you do everything in your power to assist us in complying with the order." Neither Waymo nor a lawyer representing Levandowski responded to a request for comment.

How Google plans to tackle power consumption even more aggressively in Android Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 5:29pm PDTMay 18, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 98 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares169 Android OS Development Google News Videos Yesterday at I/O Google had an interesting talk called Background Check and Other Insights into the Android Operating System Framework. It's a long name, but really it's about improving battery life in Android. It went on at great length as to how, exactly, they plan on doing that, and it's quite worth a watch. We have the video here, but if you don't have the half-hour to check it out, then you are welcome to read below. The central methodology Google is using to try to improve things is the idea of visibility. When something is running in the background and doing a ton of stuff like calling your location at quick intervals, it results in battery drain. So now Google wants to change how things happen in the background, by ensuring that free-running background services aren't sucking your battery dry. Background apps will be pushed out of memory when they leave the foreground, and requests for things like location or WiFi happening in the background will only occasionally see new information from Android. Applications that would otherwise receive broadcasts also might not wake up unless they are given an explicit call to do so in the broadcast, although there are some exceptions. Apps can still get around this by being foregrounded in some way, but now that will be something visible that the user is aware of. This focus on visibility for apps will also mean developers will have to make decisions about what is really better to the user. If doing an ongoing notification as a means of bypassing the stuff above would confuse a user, is that really the right thing for them to do in that case? Other tools can be used to schedule your tasks ahead of time or to wait for events like the job intent service that developers can use in both pre and post-O environments. Jobs and alarms also allow the OS to defer. So, if something happens that would trigger a bunch of other apps to wake up, like a new picture being taken, that can be passed to those apps one at a time after a delay. That way the user doesn't suddenly have a ton of performance issues and drain out of nowhere. Basically, Google wants to solve some of the problems with battery life by defining bad behaviors for developers, like persistent background services or accidental leaks to the background of typically foregrounded activities, and make it clear that things have to be done the right way going forward or their stuff won't work. But it's also giving them new tools and choices for how to best accomplish the things they need to do. The new features in the Play Console and in Android Studio should also help developers be aware of when they are making these mistakes so that they can be fixed. It's a matter of visibility for the developers as well as visibility for the users. To paraphrase Steve Balmer: Visibility, visibility, visibility. A significant user-facing change of this visibility mindset is a new battery menu in O, with a focus on actionable interaction. Instead of just seeing stuff like Screen and Google Play Services next to a number that they won't understand, now users will be given ways of interacting with that data if they don't like it, and can better see how they are using applications without needing to do a bunch of mental calculations. So, when a user has a problem with their expectations of battery performance and goes looking to see what might be causing it, they are more likely to find what caused it, understand what it means, and take action about it. All of these changes are is in pursuit of Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life. Right now the tools in software aren't all there, but these are steps that can take us in that direction.

Good feature to take from iOS Knowledgeborn Allah This does seem similar to what Apple implemented in iOS, but I'm curious about how this will impact RAM management. If it reduces the cache file too much, it'll just close the application completely, and you'll have to start over every time you want to use the app again. Apple somehow found a way around this problem, even in devices with less RAM, but I'm not too sure how Google will accomplish this. Even "doze" on my Pixel XL kills apps in the background all the time. This new thing sounds it could potentially make the problem worse. Justin Osborne Well I sure can tell a difference since upgrading, that's for sure. The new battery section makes me feel a lot better about how the battery is looking. But that's where it ends. Today, I got a full hour less out of my battery than normal. 2 hours vs 3-3.5 on the Pixel. That said, it's a beta, so I'm not complaining. It's definitely not the direction I want to go tho (nor are these new emoticons, sigh). marcusmarcus2 "Google's holy grail: multi-day battery life." I'm glad, but can we get a two pronged attack to address this. Yes, Google needs to keep improving the software side, but OEMs need to help out and quit making thinner phones. They are thin enough, give us more battery capacity. AbdulB1 actually they save quite a lot by putting small batteries in the phones instead of big ones. Krzysztof Jozwik I'm not sure you read OP's comment. Nothing was said about saving... AbdulB1 smaller capacity battery is much cheaper marcusmarcus2 My original comment was not about savings, cheapness, cost, etc. Jack Jennings You've said the same thing twice for no reason. Krzysztof Jozwik I wouldn't say "much" I'm no expert on the matter, but last I checked replacement batteries aren't that expensive, and I don't have the buying power of an oem AbdulB1 Most phones today dont have replacement batteries, they have unremovable ones. OEM or no OEM a 3000mAh battery will always be cheaper than 4000mAh one. marcusmarcus2 I can find batteries for my different Moto G phones that have "Non-User replaceable batteries" for nearly the same price as my LG phones that have user replaceable batteries online. Most likely the OEMs can get them for about the same as well so replaceable or not really does not matter. Either way, yes a 3000mAh battery will be cheaper than a 4000mAh one for OEMs, but probably not much at all, especially at the volume they would by at. I'm guessing they are choosing smaller batteries to make their phones thinner and not because it is slightly cheaper for them. Thinness is better to advertise to most consumers as most consumers are drawn to looks over functionality now a days. I still prefer function over looks for my devices. Krzysztof Jozwik And non replaceable will always be cheaper than replaceable. The point is, the batteries aren't the bulk of the cost. Geoff Johnson What the hell is your point? He never said anything about cost, he was just talking about stop making phones thinner for design and aesthetic reasons. james fuston The idea that smaller and thinner phones result in less battery life is a bit of a misnomer. For an example, I'd refer you to the iPhone SE. marcusmarcus2 I never said smaller and thinner. I just said thinner. They could make some of the phones the same height and width as the current one but make it a little thicker to give a thicker battery, and that would help with the battery life. james fuston Okay, but your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case. The power draw of the components is far more important than the physical size of the phone. marcusmarcus2 My general sentiment is ONLY in regards to thickness of the phone. My sentiment is not to width or height, which also make up the size of the phone. The width and height is usually determined more by the screen where thickness is more often do to battery. A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. But you seem to think the size of the battery does not make a difference, please correct me if I am wrong. Using your example of iPhone SE, if they would have made that a little thicker than it is now by making the battery larger, that would have made the battery life even longer than it already is. That is my point. james fuston > A larger screen (component) will draw more power than a smaller screen, I agree with you there. Let me give this one more shot. "your general sentiment is still that battery life is tied directly to physical size which, again stating my example of the iPhone SE, isn't the case" To break out the pieces, battery life is tied...to physical size...which, again...isn't the case. In other words, we do not agree. The iPhone SE is the exact same size as the iPhone 5S and it gets 30%+ better battery life purely through efficiency in components. To say high mAh results in long battery life is a misnomer that the G6 or V20 should be a clear reminder of. You also cannot equate physical size to battery capacity as energy density is not a universal measurement. marcusmarcus2 You are comparing different phones with different components. I agree with you that component efficiency has an effect on battery life. But... Let me give you one more shot. We will use your iPhone SE for this. If there were 2 versions of the SE. Both have the exact same components except one has a battery that is 1000 mAh larger than the other (thus making it slightly thicker), than the one with the larger battery would have more battery life, Thus the thicker one would have better battery life. That is what I am saying. I'm not comparing large phones to small phones. I'm saying if they had a larger battery in a phone with the exact same specs/components then the battery life would be better. That is all my point was. Do you not agree with that? EDIT: Yes, size of the battery may not increase with capacity due to density, but it usually will increase in size as it does increase in capacity, especially if it increases a lot. Geoff Johnson Again, you're talking about it being smaller. The iPhone SE gets good battery life because it has a 4" screen. The complaint is that phones are getting THINNER. Meaning that they still have 5.5-6" displays, but are thinner and translate to smaller batteries. james fuston Nope, not at all. The cell in the SE is about 50mAh bigger than the 5S (which is the exact same size). The 30%+ battery life improvement comes from more efficient components, not just their size. marcusmarcus2 Technically it is 2 dimensional train of thought. Also, if they increased it horizontally or vertically, then they would most likely have to increase the dimensions of the phone horizontally or vertically, thus changing the size of the screen or bezel. Increasing it thickness wise means they would not have to change the look of the of the front of the phone. Anywho, I'm only talking about thickness, not height, width, different components, different phones, not small phones or big phones. I'm talking just battery capacity, if all other components remain the same. Thickening the battery would add battery capacity without changing the over all look much at all. It could be any phone of your choosing. If adding a thicker/higher capacity battery to whatever 1 phone you want, that phone would have a longer battery life. Do you not agree with that logic? james fuston Thickness is commonly referred to as "depth" otherwise known as the Z-axis. That's one dimension. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8cba520372d511803190227fe949a5d698a79509804cb6ec7f8f2afbe25323c3.gif Sk0ly You can't compare between OSs. There is a reason Android uses more battery, it features true multitasking and doesn't drastically limit background processes like iOS. Looks like Google is going a bit to the Apple approach going forward as devs can't be counted on to write decent code. james fuston Seeing as we're talking about physical dimensions and hardware specifications and they're effect on power draw, you absolutely can compare between operating systems. Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system. Jason B "Processors aren't suddenly able to use more power than they're designed to use just because you've installed a different operating system." Just to jump in: sure, they won't use more than their design power, but they can be used very inefficiently depending on OS. All modern mobile SoCs have hardware clock and power gating, but if software isn't allowing the SoC to idle properly or needs to use more CPU/GPU cycles to complete tasks versus other OS, yes, you will use more power as the clocks+voltage jump around instead of going into SoC's proper sleep mode for former or will hold onto higher clocks longer for latter. Apple makes both its hardware and software, so if you think that has no net effect, well ... Sk0ly Except the OS's operate in a completely different manner. Androids advantage being background functionality and iOS advantage being battery life. JD The SE wasn't thinner. Ryne Hager Give me a OnePlus with 5000mAh and I would be so happy. someone755 Give me a 4.7" phone like the og Moto X and I would be so happy. Neither of us are going to be happy, Ryne. Drakenoid OG Moto X updated for current year would be perfect for me. Vlad I never broke a single headphone since I first had a smartphone in 2011 until I got a 5" phone. Since then, I need to buy new ones if I use one daily for more than 2 weeks, simply because sitting or walking up on stairs will break the cable thanks to the length of the phone. Upsides: 5" phone with 4100 mAh battery => amazing. And it's also thin as heck. Downsides: breaks headphones, bends, need to root for decent software (Xiaomi). Gimme back my 4.5" 720p screen, Motorola. Kristian Ivanov I highly agree on the thin phones part. Bought a Huawei P10 2 days ago, for me, that thing is unusable without a case to make it a bit fatter. Karly Johnston If they fix idle battery drain that doesn't become an issue. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying they should not fix battery drain. I'm saying if they fix battery drain AND add higher capacity battery (making phone a little thicker), they could increase battery life even more than just addressing one of them. So if fixing the battery drain adds another day and a thicker battery adds another day, you'd go from 1 day to 3 days instead of just 2 days from only fixing battery drain. Karly Johnston The battery life the current 625 phones are getting is where flagships need to be. That should be enough for anyone. marcusmarcus2 Everyone is not all the same. It may be enough for you. I'm saying, phones are beyond thin enough and could be thicker to increase battery life even more beyond what a 625 phone can do. Now, this is my opinion in regards to how I would like to use a phone. You are welcome to your own opinion. I'm not going to say what should be enough for anyone other than me. Karly Johnston The OEMs don't think that is what the vast majority of people need or want. Their target is a full day of battery life which is what most people are worried about. It isn't my opinion, it is the industry opinion of what the marketing priorities are. X-47B My phone has 4000 mAh battery, and it's 5.5-inch display. I easily get 2 days of battery even after heavy usage. Margaritas Ante Porcos Installed O on my 6p and battery still drains like a whore in a bukkake twelvesome. Google really can't do nothing at this point. Android is breaking to pieces. So many things needed to be fixed in O but instead Android's got even worse. That notification empty desert area of white grey nothingness kills me the most. Hate it really bad. The last Android I liked was 6th. catalysto Not sure what you're talking about. Battery life on my 6P with the new O is great. Maybe you have an aging battery? Margaritas Ante Porcos as long as your 6p works great, nothing else matters, right? Roy That's right. catalysto Just saying. My anecdotal evidence is as good as yours. And having poor battery life across multiple OS versions is a pretty strong indicator for a bad battery, don't ya think? In fact, I had the same problem with a previous 6P. iFeign Complain some more about your beta software Margaritas Ante Porcos It started with 7.1.2. Do you really need to be a btch when bad things happen to others? Roy For me everything goes smooth on my 6P on 7.1.2. so I need to complain that Android to good. The Wrath of Kahn If your 6P has shut down even once before reaching about 5% then you most likely have one of the defective batteries. I had to have mine replaced, but after that, it runs all day like a charm. ODP2 improved it, if anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos it was fine for a long time until I updated to 7.1.2. That update screwed the battery that was working superb all the time. DANA Try to do a factory reset, it fixes many problem for some user. Margaritas Ante Porcos It was one of the first things I did. Twice. Did not help. Paul_Werner Yeah you got to call Google (if you got yours from the Play Store). They've been replacing 6Ps with factory refurbished ones even out of warranty (source: it happened to me) Matthew Skalecki The update didn't screw up your battery. The battery was going to crap out on you regardless of which Android version you had. This happened to many people including me. Replacing the battery fixes the issue; reverting to a previous os does nothing. Zach Mauch Did you go through Google or a local shop? The Wrath of Kahn Unfortunately it was out of warranty, had a friend with the skills do it for me. JD I need more of this colorful imagery to describe simple everyday problems. mchalakov First off you are using a beta OS don't complain. Second thing is that battery drain comes mostly from the (bad)apps - if you watched the video or read the article you could understand. Third - I'm pretty sure you can go back to Marshmallow if you are so so so unhappy with Nougat or O. Jakst Really? Yesterday was my first day with Android O. I plugged my phone out at 7, and come home at midnight with 35 % battery left. I've never had that kind of battery life in my 6P before. So I've seen huge gains with this O preview. thereasoner The Android O beta I'm using is so slow to charge my Pixel today that it seems like that's what they tackled​....and not in a good way. iFeign Surprise, surprise, you're running BETA software. Smh. thereasoner Yeah I know and I'm sure it will get fixed between now and September. I'm just saying that the current difference in charge time is quite noticable at this point. AbdulB1 maybe they removed quick charge support in beta mattcoz Pixel never had quick charge. AbdulB1 hmm interesting. I thought it has qualcomm processor so it must have qc 3.0 too. Must be some proprietary stuff or qualcomm must be asking for more money to enable it. mattcoz Google is pushing the open USB-C power delivery standard. AbdulB1 Display screen eats up most of my battery. I can't see what google is doing will fix it somehow. We need different types of screens now. iFeign Uhh, it's as if you expect things to use NO battery at all. Infinite battery life! Of course using the screen, aka, using the phone, is going to be the largest proportionate power drain - no matter how fancy the screen tech. AbdulB1 battery tech has still not improved and nor did the screen tech. I can accept that the screen tech will remain same for a long time but as far as batteries are concerned they can be improved , made for longer number of recharge cycles but that hasn't caught up with the manufacturers yet. One thing which can be done is increasing the battery capacity but we all know this is not happening as phone manufactures think it will make phones bulky , add weight and in long term affect the sale of newer devices. Latheryin Multi day battery life will not happen until new battery tech comes around. With people needlessly having screen on times of 5+ hours there is no way to keep a battery charged for extended periods. Krzysztof Jozwik I average 2 hours of screen on time a day. Just because some use their phone 24/7 doesn't mean we all do. I have a job where I'm not on my phone, at home I have better screens to get info from. The phone is there when I need it. Your nonstop use case is not the norm. Latheryin As do I but that is not the norm. Might want to look at any forum about battery life and looking at screen on times. Most want and use 5+ hours. It's mainly the older generation like us that doesn't need it and are not on the device all the time. Krzysztof Jozwik Obviously the forums about battery life have people winning that they want 48 hours of screen on. That is not the norm. Sure, lots of people want that, most do not. Latheryin Most want more screen on time. Why do you think battery life is such an issue. disqusdeeznuts My Moto Z Play begs to differ. Motorola does it right with this phone. It has a good size battery (3510), an efficient processor, and runs smooth. It can be done, but for some reason, it just isn't a focus for a majority of manufacturers. Latheryin Well sure all the devices with that mid range chip and battery combo can get ok battery life. I could easily. Get 2 days out of my device and it only has a 3200 battery. It is not the oem. It's people. They need to spend less time look at their phone and more time living life. Which many are unprepared for. Cakefish I'm going the leaked Moto X4 continues that legacy onwards! Rod Ever heard of the Moto z Play, or Lenovo P2? Latheryin As already stated on that. The moto has a mid tear chip. As for the Lenovo, nope. Can't say I have, it's either not sold in my country or a mid low tier device that I wouldn't have noticed. Just looked. They both use the same mid tier chip. Also that does have a good battery. But that like the K1000 with a 10000 battery are the exception and seldom are they flagship quality. WarpspeedScp The Moto z does not have an SD 820 on it. Neither does the P2. It's very annoying that manufacturers can't give us something functional instead of eye-candy for once. Rod While it's not top of line sillicon, real world testes have proven that, for everyday tasks, there's virtually no difference between the S625 ans 821 WarpspeedScp Well, my phone has an SD 650, and dolphin emulator just about keeps up (wind waker and super smash Bros). On an 820, there would definitely be better results. Paul Troy I have a better idea. Get the hardware manufacturers to put a bigger battery in their devices. 💡 Taedirk If we could convince hardware manufacturers to do something useful, we wouldn't be on yet another revision to how Android updates the OS. Alex Yeah so this way the horrible wakelocks (that Android makes almost impossible to manage) will be less visible. Cakefish Why not both? Zach Mauch All I want to know is can they stop wakelocks. JD Same bullshit every year. I'll believe it when I see it. Unless Android O somehow allows me to download more mAh. Morten Ulv Are you trying to say Android battery life hasn't improved VASTLY over the years? JD Yep in fact it's regressed Morten Ulv I have no such issues. Better battery all across the board. JD What ever you're smoking pass that shit around Morten Ulv Your shit must be stronger than mine. browngeek I miss the days of my Xperia Z3 Lollipop and Stamina mode. Used to get 48 hours and 5-6 hours SOT. D13H4RD2L1V3 I hope this actually does something when the final build is out. I'm getting tired of hearing of every new battery improvement in a new version of Android only to have a wakelock pretty much make all of that moot. Dennis Ulijn I am on the Android O beta, and i must say that the information i get from it it really useful! I never could find the wakelocks because i'm not rooted, but now i can easily see what apps use up battery in the background. Awake meditation app was in use for 15 minutes (meditation) and active in the background for 1 hour (basically, ever since the meditation)! "Restrict background usage" to on, and we'll see what it brings tomorrow. PI this is interesting .... :) ,, Whats the current update Dennis Ulijn I'm in Europe so I just woke up. I'll let you know end of the day. Dennis Ulijn k. End of the day here. The apps (pocketcasts and aware) behaved nicely now. at 23%, which is not that great with 2 hours of screen on time and 32% and 5%of the battery used up by system and services respectively. (apps 32%, system 32%, services 5%, Cell standby 3%, idle 2%, bluetooth and wifi 0%) PI System 32% ,,, ???? Sabin Bajracharya Meanwhile Google's own apps will somehow be able to bypass this restriction :D Michael Sørensen Google's own location services, Now cards, Chrome, etc. eats the most battery for me - even worse with location history on. How about fixing that first...? WarpspeedScp Try Firefox! Also, turn location off as soon as you can. mlm5em But with O, you can now turn off Background activity on an app specific basis. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eaaaef5de863733535628a24f5b0d44f888ae3ff0cb89d1c8cffc0680083c526.png mattcoz Good to see there's an option to turn it off. Morten Ulv Very handy! IncCo Anything that improves the battery life is awesome John Monks I have concerns about this. There are some apps I *want* running in the background, but I don't want them filling up the notification shade. One example, Lightflow has to have a pointless notification in order to do the job I installed it to do. I know it's there, any consequences for my battery life are mine to live with. It would be OK if I could toggle a setting to permit a particular app to run a 'free running background service' silently but this is Google so I expect I'll have to put up with spam instead (and no, collapsed notifications are still notifications), or there will be a toggle that does nothing, like the 'ignore optimisation' setting that currently exists. Drakenoid There apparently is, check comments above, there's a screenshot. Cakefish It's about damn time. All hail Android O. AdamH So does it mean my phone will be useless? something_new Apple was right then Đức Thành I'm beginning to get excited again, even knowing that actually achieving this would take many years. Fidelator Allow us, the end user, to have absolute control over which apps can run in the background under certain conditions, I have disabled notifications on Facebook and Instagram yet they still have multiple persistent RAM hogging battery sucking services 100% of the time smeddy My next phone won't get a look-in without a 4000mah+ battery in it. Since Samsung dropped the removable battery, battery anxiety has crept back into my life. abc Multi-day battery life? Ha! I solved this over a decade ago. The key to long battery life is having an actual life. Have friends and family and an active social life. Don't be the loser who keeps fiddling with his phone every few mins, when everyone already knows you don't get any important messages. You'll be amazed how long your battery lasts when you aren't pulling out to jerk off on it every few mins. And for god's sake, at home, a cell phone should be no different than a landline. If you're watching videos or playing games on your 5" inch screen, you need to invest in a PC or console. Sk0ly Good for Google. Some apps, particularly Facebook and Facebook messenger run ALWAYS in the background, even when you haven't used the applications in days. In my opinion, this is just lazy coding and is likely due to Facebook's data mining. In comparison, Hangouts and Allo only run on demand. Android has always allowed developers freedom to responsibly code their apps to allow them to do more. This is recognition that this freedom has been abused and now developers have to be treated more similarly to how they are on iOS.

Although it is already quick and easy to trigger Assistant with your voice and ask a question, you couldn’t use it when in a quiet environment. Now that keyboard should be rolling out to all, which form of input do you prefer using? UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases We got our first hint that Google might be adding keyboard input to Assistant back in January after an APK teardown. Now that it is here, users can use it within Assistant by just tapping on the keyboard icon after launching the virtual assistant. There are pros and cons for each use case. The quickest way to activate Assistant is by using the “Ok, Google” phrase and then asking it a question. The downside of this is that you don’t always want to ask it a question out loud and then have it vocally respond. Using the keyboard fixes these issues, but the process can be much slower as there are several steps required before you can type in your query. So, do you prefer using keyboard input or voice input when communicating with Google Assistant? Or does your preference depend on the situation?

Companies pay Google so their adverts appear first on searches such as ‘how to beat cancer’. And experts say that many of the medical treatments sold by these advertisers would put patients at serious risk. Google auctions advertising space to firms selling bogus medicines so they can target users with life-threatening illnesses Experts say that many of the medical treatments sold by these advertisers would put patients at serious risk Others targeted include sufferers of HIV and mental-health problems. Firms that sell diet pills also pay the search engine so that their adverts are prominent when insecure girls type in the phrase: ‘Weight loss for teens.’ And money-lenders pay a premium to target needy Britons searching for ‘no credit check loans’. Google makes huge profits selling this advertising space based on these specific search terms used by desperate people. Last night campaigners accused Google of ‘mugging the most vulnerable members of our society, those who are clinging to life and desperate for hope’. It comes amid growing fury at Google’s links to vile content online. The technology giant has previously been found to profit from hate speech on its YouTube video site. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next GP and her nurse husband trafficked a Nigerian 'slave nanny'... Three event workers are injured after fire breaks out at... Share this article Share The Conservative manifesto pledges to crack down on social-media sites ‘to protect the vulnerable and give people confidence to use the internet without fear of abuse, criminality or exposure to horrific content’. Advertising space on the search engine is sold through auction, with companies bidding to appear top of search results – then paying Google each time their link is clicked on. A Mail reporter signed up as a potential advertiser with Google. He found that the site was looking for advertisers targeting Britons with ‘health conditions and concerns’, including cancer, depression, eating disorders, Aids and HIV, vision loss, dementia, diabetes, menopause and learning disabilities. Firms bid about £1.30 per click for their products or services to appear first under the search phrase: ‘How to beat cancer.’ This means the prominent adverts under these results included one for an Indian firm promising to ‘fight cancer with herbs’ – using supplements made from ginger, gooseberry and aloe vera. But experts believe the treatment could actually harm patients’ chances of beating the disease. Other alternative medicine companies bid about £2 per click for their adverts to appear on searches for ‘natural cures for cancer’. The advertisements that appeared for this promised cures without chemotherapy at clinics in Mexico and Germany. And Google also profits from searches by those suffering mental-health problems. Companies bid to pay the technology giant about 83p per click to have their adverts appear when Britons search for ‘anxiety relief’. This means the top results for this search on Google are adverts trying to sell herbal remedies. Experts say that the pills can be extremely dangerous as there is no proof that they work and so they could prevent or delay people with mental-health problems seeking proper medical help. Terms auctioned to unscrupulous weight-loss pill companies for about £1 per click include: ‘weight loss for teens’, ‘weight loss pills for teenage girl’, ‘safe weight loss pills’ and ‘quick weight loss pills’. Others who are targeted by the adverts include those worried about memory loss and older men with erectile dysfunction. Payday loan companies spend up to £6.85 per click to appear first when people in financial trouble search Google for ‘payday loan’, ‘quick loans’ and ‘payday loans no credit check’. Last night Conservative candidate for Totnes Dr Sarah Wollaston, an ex-GP and former chairman of the Commons health select committee, said: ‘Google should not duck responsibility for the content of adverts, especially those targeting vulnerable people with quack remedies.’ Companies bid to pay the technology giant about 83p per click to have their adverts appear when Britons search for ‘anxiety relief’ Pharmacist Sultan Dajani, who is also spokesman for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, added: ‘Information technology was meant to be a tool for empowering and enabling information but here it is being used to mug the most vulnerable members of our society, those who are clinging to life and desperate for hope. ‘Google has a moral duty to take a more professional, ethical and responsible approach. It must stop snake-oil salesmen benefiting and profiteering from others’ misery.’ Former minister Baroness Altmann, a finance campaigner, said: ‘It really does seem disappointing that a firm such as Google would want to profit from promoting such ruinously expensive loans to potentially vulnerable people, desperate to borrow money.’ Google has faced criticism for its links to dangerous content online. After the Westminster atrocity in March, the Mail revealed that jihadi guides to mounting a car terror attack could be found in seconds using the search engine. After being contacted by the Mail, Google removed alternative medicine adverts that we found which targeted people with cancer and HIV, women going through the menopause and teenagers looking for weight loss pills. It is reviewing payday loan adverts. But other adverts that were flagged by the Mail – including those targeting people with anxiety and memory loss – remained on Google, as they were not deemed to break company policies. Google says that it has strict rules for healthcare advertisers banning false claims and any advertisements found to have broken these policies are removed. The firm says it uses a third-party firm to monitor advert results and has banned adverts from payday loan firms that demand repayment within 60 days. A spokesman added: ‘We have a set of strict policies which govern what ads we allow on Google. ‘We do not allow ads that promote false or misleading health claims and quickly take action when we discover ads that break our policies.’   Share or comment on this article e-mail 9 shares Most watched News videos Outraged passenger films tram driver asleep on the job One crazy bird!

Swedish Prosecutors Drop Rape Investigation Of Julian Assange Based On A Technicality Gizmodo Movie Night: The 5 Best Movies Ever Google's Coolest Tech Is Getting Harder And Harder To See Michael Nunez May 20, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  artificial intelligence google google i/o google io 2017 machine learning tensorflow video feature Share Google always uses its annual I/O developer conference as a place to trot out some of its biggest and most exciting product updates. You'd be forgiven for feeling like this year was kind of a dud. There were no new gadgets, no new moonshot projects, and not even cool new swag like Google Cardboard headsets. The keynote was essentially just a boring two-hour lecture about small, incremental updates to existing products. Image: AP We're not alone in thinking so, either! Is it just me or is #GoogleIO less surprising then any year before, all incremental developments, no big leaps, almost boring — Erik Jonker (@ErikJonker) May 17, 2017 Google IO 2017 : the most boring keynote ever ! — Aurélien Guillard (@a_guillard) May 17, 2017 This year's keynote presentation was very out of character for the search giant. Google events in the past have typically included product launches like new Android devices, Chromebooks, Daydream VR, Google Home, and other things you could touch and see. But this year, Google seemed to be concentrating its efforts on refining those products with artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, and other improvements behind the scenes. Consider one of the most interesting announcements at the Google I/O keynote, Google Lens, which adds image recognition to existing apps like Assistant and Photos. It essentially lets you point your phone's camera at a flower, and it will tell you what type of plant it is, or you could point it at a restaurant, and on your screen you'd see reviews. The feature is illustrative of the AI technology that Google is currently building that isn't a standalone product. This is true of most of the impressive developments at Google. They aren't quite as visible as older products were. A great example is Google's new Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) that are processors made specifically for machine learning. The new TPUs debuted at the keynote presentation this week and were perhaps the most innovative thing Google announced — but they didn't quite capture the hype as older products because they're made for businesses and researchers, not everyday consumers. This, of course, doesn't mean that Google is out of good ideas. It's still one of the most sophisticated and valuable companies in the world. Google certainly isn't done making with hardware and new software — we're expecting a snazzy new Pixel phone with a curved screen later this year — but its decade-long run of launching products in flashy new categories like virtual reality and wearables is beginning to slow down. Now, the company is squarely focused on making its products better after rushing into several new markets. Take something like TensorFlow, one of Google's most important products launched in recent years that most people know nothing about. TensorFlow is an open-source software library for machine learning that Google uses for research and in its own products. It essentially makes it easier for developers to program AI systems. The importance of TensorFlow was cemented in October 2015 when Google announced it was using the system to power RankBrain, an artificial intelligence system built for its core search product. RankBrain was able to beat human experts in identifying the most relevant pages for search results, according to a Bloomberg report. Even though this breakthrough was momentous, it was not celebrated nearly as much as Google's flashier launches for products like Google Home and Daydream VR the following year. It's hard for Google to get consumers excited about announcements like this. There's nothing to hold up and show a crowd, and explaining how neural networks work in laymen's terms is difficult. This is the bleeding-edge of technology being created by some of the smartest minds in America. The only way to really excite consumers is to show them the result of having such artificial intelligence crawl their personal data. This week's keynote at Google I/O simply reiterated that it's hard to get people excited about incremental AI and cloud updates. Google CEO Sundar Pichai essentially acknowledged this in the beginning of his address when he stood in front of a large screen that said, "Mobile first to AI first." He set the tone for big reveals later in the presentation like Google Lens and major updates to Google Home. Both were a huge deal — and just because you can't see them, doesn't mean that they aren't really impressive. Comments Be the first to comment on this story!

Post-Pornhub, there's simply less demand -- for paid content, for new content. But if history has proven anything, it's that pornography finds a way.

The development raises the possibility that Uber may end up dumping Anthony Levandowski, whose expertise in robot-controlled cars is the main reason that the ride-hailing company bought Levandowski's startup for $680 million nine months ago. Until last month, Levandowski had been running Uber's self-driving car division. Although he no longer is doing that, he remains a vital part of Uber's effort to develop a fleet of robot cars so its service eventually will no longer have to rely on people to pick up passengers. Waymo, a self-driving car company started by Google, alleges Levandowski downloaded 14,000 documents containing its trade secrets before he founded the startup that he sold to Uber. Levandowski has asserted his rights under the Fifth Amendment since Waymo filed its lawsuit in February . But Uber is warning Levandowski that he may lose his job unless he waives those rights and reveals whether he took any Waymo documents. The San Francisco company made the threat in a May 15 letter that became public in a court filing late Thursday. Any admission by Levandowski that he possesses the Waymo documents could embroil him in even deeper legal trouble. That's because Waymo's allegations in the civil case have been referred to the U.S. Attorney's office in San Francisco for a potential criminal investigation under an unusual order issued last week by U.S. District Judge William Alsup. Uber had been standing by Levandowski's right use his Fifth Amendment protections until last week when Alsup issued another decision requiring the company to return any documents belonging to Waymo by May 31. Alsup wrote that "in complying with this order, Uber has no excuse under the Fifth Amendment to pull any punches as to Levandowski." Uber alluded to Alsup's stern language in its explaining its change of heart to Levandowski. "While we have respected your personal liberties, it is our view that the court's order requires us to make these demands of you," Uber's general counsel, Salle Yoo, wrote in the letter. Levandowski is fighting back by trying to persuade Alsup to revise his order to protect his Fifth Amendment rights. In a filing, Levandowski's attorneys argued that it's unconstitutional for a judge to strong-arm an employer into pressuring a worker to give up his Fifth Amendment rights to remain on the job. "It is an act by the judicial branch of our federal government compelling an individual to choose between preserving his livelihood and preserving his constitutional rights," Levandowski's lawyers wrote. Waymo's lawsuit already has handcuffed Levandowski. The case prompted Levandowski to temporarily step aside as Uber's top self-driving car executive and avoid working on anything related to lidar, an array of sensors that enables autonomous vehicles to navigate the roads. Alsup has ordered Uber to ensure its work on lidar remains off limits to Levandowski. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Google Lens, which uses image-recognition technology, was revealed this week by the internet firm’s CEO Sundar Pichai. “Google Lens is a set of vision-based computing capabilities that can understand what you’re looking at and help you take action based on that information,” said Mr Pichai. Users will be able to point their phone’s camera at a shop front or a heritage site and a Google Maps card will pop up on the screen, inviting them to learn more about the area they’re in. When your phone camera is pointed at a shopfront, for example, Google Lens will pull up the name of the store, its rating and other business information. It is understood that the when the technology is used via Google Assistant, your phone’s camera will be able to use the tool to translate languages. Other abilities include shopping suggestions. During a demonstration of the new technology, a phone camera was pointed at a concert venue. A pop-up then displayed on the screen showing upcoming gigs, where to buy tickets, and an option to add a date to your calendar. Google Lens will also allow people to join a wifi network by focusing their phone camera on the router’s log-in information. The tool is being described as having the ability to turn your camera into a “super-intelligent” search engine. No release date has been set but the company said the new tool will be available “in coming months”.

But it seems many other applications may be about to follow in its footsteps. As reported by Android Police, Google has made hiding a store app from rooted devices an official option for developers. Part of the Google Play Console updates announced at I/O 2017 includes the introduction of a device catalog section under the Release management setting. The section allows developers to specify which devices can view their app(s) on the Play Store based on certain criteria, such as performance indicators like RAM that’s under 1Gb and unsupported SoCs. But devices can also be excluded if they don’t pass SafetyNet tests or aren’t certified by Google; i.e. they’re rooted or are running custom ROMs. As is the case with the Netflix app, just because rooted users can’t see the apps in the Play Store doesn’t mean they won’t work on a device. The process is different from the full SafetyNet API implementation used with apps like Android Pay and Pokemon GO, which won’t run unless a phone passes an integrity test when the application launches. If you know what you’re doing and avoid dubious sites, you can always just install the APK from other sources. “SafetyNet Exclusions only restrict the availability of your app from the Play Store. Users can still install your app using the APK file directly,” writes Google. Nevertheless, the new developer feature is likely to annoy a lot of people.

Android O Developer Preview 2 gets a small bump to OPP2.170420.019, fixes Android Pay but isn't installing on many Nexus devices [Update] Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/18 6:32pm PDTMay 18, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 102 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares191 Android O Android OS Google News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Nexus Player Pixel Pixel XL Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory Android O's second developer preview was only released yesterday, but Google has already released an update for it. We're getting bombarded with tips from readers with Nexus and Pixel devices alike. This update reportedly somewhat fixes Android Pay, which did not open at all on yesterday's version. However, it appears that Nexus devices are having trouble updating. This OTA bumps the version number to OPP2.170420.019 and is weighing in at anywhere between 38.8 and 55.9MB, depending on which Google device you have. One tipster informed us that Pay is no longer throwing him an 'unsupported in this build' message and shows him a normal screen with his cards, but hasn't tested whether they're working or not. It appears that Pay has been fixed via a server-side update, which is why some people who have had trouble updating their Nexuses can now use the Pay app.   A rare, successful install on a Nexus 6P. While the update seems to be installing just fine on Pixel and Pixel XL devices, a majority of owners with Nexus devices appear to be having some trouble. From what we can tell, units of Nexus 5X and 6P smartphones, as well as the Nexus Player, are throwing errors and showing the dead Android logo in recovery. After a hard reboot, the devices are booting up fine, but they remain on yesterday's OPP2.170420.017 build. One user is claiming that Android Pay has begun working for his 6P, despite the install appearing to fail. However, there are users successfully updating their 6Ps to the 0.019 build. (update: It looks like those who flashed the O factory image are updating without issue, while those who took the OTA from Nougat are struggling. This is due to devices that updated from Nougat via OTA retaining the 7.1.2 build fingerprint. Flashing the factory image and then taking the OTA should get the update to work.) Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available. An official post in the Android Beta Program Google+ page states that the update will hit all devices currently enrolled in the preview within the next few hours, but given the installation failures that Nexus devices are seeing, it's likely to be halted. We'll update this post with more information when we get it. Update 1: 2017/05/20 9:18am PDT Google is now sending out a full OTA, measuring in at around 1GB, to Nexus devices that were unable to update due to the incremental flash fail. Additionally, 0.019 factory and OTA images are now available to download.

Leroy You have to enable the special permissions, under apps& notifications Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Where exactly? do you have a screenshot ? Tiuri Elvander If I go to Settings > Apps & Notifications > App Info, and select Gmail (because it's often shown to support dots in screenshots), Then I go to App notifications and Badge app icon is switched on, yet none appear. Is there a different setting somewhere that I've missed??? Ah, just saw another reply. It's pixel launcher only :( Laraib Zafar Khan Is the notification dot only for pixel launcher? Tr3ple Yes Daniel Grobe I have pixel launcher on my nexus 5x, the dots dont work for me.. nor does the picture in picture.

Julian Berger Yes I have it when playing Youtube videos in chrome maestro PL Installed fine on my 6P. Android Pay enabled OkieDokie This small OTA failed to install for me twice (Nexus 6P) 2 Men-E Thanks for the update on the update... My Nexus 6P and I await good news... vwnut13 Had to revert on my Nexus player, as the update broke Hulu. On second thought, wonder if it has anything to do with my unlocked bootloader... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Remember folks this software isn't ready for a daily driver yet. They say so themselves. Consider yourself lucky if your using it and they fix stuff like android pay. Also do not forget to unlock your bootloader if you are using the beta. If you do not unlock the bootloader and the beta on your phone goes south you can not use your computer to fix your phone and restore it. Period. The only fix is to send it in. You can re lock the bootloader after the final stable builds are released. Carson Saldanha Wow, thanks for that second part. Didn't think about that. 👍 Dn Bro I disagree with the bootloader thing. I think if they are sending out fixes to Android Pay, they actually want the bootloaders locked. Also, I would say that at the very least, make sure you go into deveopler settings and allow unlocking. That way, you can at least still unlock your phone if it won't boot. Matty032 Is that the USB Debugging option? Dn Bro No it's oem unlocking option https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e5b64da4b008176fb08c064f9e16566252aa48001e2ccb59231062d5af2a2dd4.png ZettabyteGamer I'm using it as my daily and while it has only been one day it has been pretty solid for me. It's in beta, I think it is ready for daily driver use for people who are okay with minor hiccups here and there. Martial Clausse I don't think it's ready yet. Lots of apps are crashing, including inbox and Google search... Joshua Lillis The only app that FC on me is Samsung pay, smooth sailing for me. Martial Clausse Out of curiosity, which device are you using ? And did you update through the OTA or flashed the factory image ? Joshua Lillis I have the pixel XL, I enrolled in the beta program and took two ota, one from nougat to o and then the .019 OTA. SomeGuy112 Seems pretty stable on my Pixel XL. The Pixel performance lead at Google said the Beta is pretty stable on Twitter recently but maybe that's only for the Pixel version. https://mobile.twitter.com/t_murray/status/864927591274127360 Martial Clausse After a day or two, all the crashes seem to have gone away automagically... It was bad, I couldn't read my emails and so on, but now everything works... So I'll keep this as a daily driver :) Laraib Zafar Khan Apple music is FC too BrandoHD This information isn't correct, you can flash official factory images with a locked bootloader ZettabyteGamer I hope you didn't mean to reply to me, because I never said anything about a bootloader. Joshua Lillis I think he meant to reply to Nexus 2 Men-E I don't use Android Pay, but I do notice the signal will drop for extensive periods of time on my Nexus 6P... Most stuff is running "okay", though... LALO Everything works fine on my Google Pixel. Surprisingly no apps have crashed since I updated. blackeyeX2 On my 6P, I have had more FC's and freezing than I did on the Alpha preview. boop Looks like it comes with the new Assistant features (or maybe I just got them at the same time). Dirge You got them the same time. It is a server side switch. . Carlos Rodríguez The OTA fails because the recovery has an old build fingerprint from 7.1.2, so the installer fails. You can try to install the OTA many times and it will fail. When you get the error, press Power + Volume Up to see the actual error, then you can safely reboot from there. The solution is to sideload the full DP2 OTA from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download-ota.html ) or the factory image from here (https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html ) and then you can install the small OTA. Cheers! Peter Good work sir. Thanks for the info. Richard Gao Thanks for letting us know. I've added this to the post. Mike Arnett Stupid question: the OTA on my phone to this was 55mb, but the OTA package is 1GB. Is this the full image, and will it wipe all my data? Carlos Rodríguez The full OTA shouldn't wipe the device, make a backup just in case. blackeyeX2 The 55mb one was an update to the full (1GB) released yesterday. bobfrealy Per Carlos R.'s suggestion, after having registered for beta, taking 017 ota, failing with E3001 error on 019 ota, I downloaded and sideloaded the 017 ota. now the 019 system update notification is nowhere to be found. any idea on how to get that back? just wait? meanwhile recover still shows 7.1.2, and Android Pay seems to be running fine. Carlos Rodríguez After some minutes the update should show up. Check for updates. It eventually appeared for me the 3 times it failed to install. bobfrealy yep, it showed back up. and still failed (that's why i mentioned my recovery version, most likely the issue). will likely have to do full image. better to have a full clean install, just a pain with much setup to do afterward. blackeyeX2 Google Pay. My update failed, but Android Pay is now working anyways. Zikaeroh This didn't work for me. After sideloading the update and trying to install the OTA, I get the same error. I'd simply flash just the recovery image from the factory image, but I'm not OEM unlocked. :( Carlos Rodríguez Indeed. The only solution is to unlock the bootloader and flash the DP2 recovery. I guess we're screwed until google does something. Paige Turner I'am freelancing using the web, performing basic jobs that requires from you personal pc or alternatively laptop and additionally internet service access and so I couldn't be more satisfied... 6 months have passed by when i started off this and also i profited up to now overall 36,000 dollars... Basically i profit almost $80/hourly and work for 3 to 4 h everyday.And superb point regarding this work is that you can actually decide when to work yourself as well as for how long and you are compensated at the end of each week.>>>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Flint_PS 017 OTA sideload doesn't work, I got the error again Fernando Pena So, I decided to start from scratch and flashed the factory image, following updating the .19 OTA. Everything went just fine and I was able to boot the device and restore my backup. Then I started to install/update my apps and noticed that Google App isn't updating, the app keeps refusing to update even downloading the latest APK from apkmirror. It's currently stuck at version 6.16 and this sucks because assistant is not working. Play store doesn't show any updates even if I apply for Google app beta. I don't know what to do, I would appreciate some help... blackeyeX2 The updated images ending 19 are not available yet, the ones posted are still 17. So OTA is only option for now. JC I was getting the same error. It never successfully installed on my nexus 5x. Dn Bro So I did the OTA yesterday on my Nexus 6P, got the Android Pay is unsupported, as was the case. Today, tried this update, it failed, but now when I open the android pay it shows my cards like normal. Not sure if they work, but there you go. Nate Hallett I'm still on the .017 build from yesterday on my Pixel XL, I took the beta OTA and have opened & used Android Pay without a problem. I don't understand why so many people don't have Android Pay enabled on yesterday's build, even with the N Preview they enabled Android Pay so why would it be different this time around? I'm currently waiting for the .019 OTA to finish installing, I'll update my comment with the results. nxtiak I'm on 017 on my XL and I just opened Android Pay and it said it's not enabled in this preview. Installing 019 now. lomsha It's only toward the end that pay was enabled on n previews, not from the start. Frisi Started installing on my Pixel XL. After step 1 was done, it restarted. Still on .017. Thing is, it started step 2 but it hangs here. Andeoid Pay now works, though. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/721d0f338ee7cfe4ff4a19f06d55c9318dd4fa5e7be02f24d9f4befb5eff7b14.png Frisi Well, it started moving after I posted this. I don't know what's causing it to take that long. daburghit It failed for me on a Nexus 5X but I can secondarily confirm that Android Pay works post-failure on the 17 build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c5c1a621e6af03a2092437d0a84552a7cb821509966e5f48c9bdb8ce2a19af5.png Anthony Castanza Android Pay started loading again for me *without* installing this update. It appears to be a server side fix and not directly related to this build. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca05de36f641e9afb90773dd4129e37cd5eee46791485bab34ec82e2c423f39.png Chris Thurber Same for me as well except on a 6P! JeffCO Just updated on the XL and Android Pay which was not working earlier now comes up. Haven't tried to use it. Bizziet I was hoping it fixed the now broken MMS issue in messages! Try to add a picture and the whole messages app freezes. Pixel XL on T-mobile. ZettabyteGamer Just updated my XL and when I go to add a new card to Android Pay I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device" So it isnt fixed for me atleast. Lucas Araujo It seems that the update has been pulled. My N5X had the same problem while applying the update and it is not showing in the updates anymore. My Android version still at *.017. Also, after update failure, my google photos app lost its icon and ir showing a generic Android Robot icon. bobfrealy My Photos app icon had this problem immediately after taking 017 ota. reboot; clear cache; etc, re-install app, nothing restored icon. :( doesn't matter now as i'm likely full 017 flashing. blackeyeX2 I disabled the app (which then uninstalled app to original version), then it updated and Icon is back to normal!! Just wiping the cache will not work. blackeyeX2 It's not pulled. It will show up again in your notifications in 30 min, or so. I've tried it a couple of times and each time it reappears after some time. JohnyNoLegs Quality google. Brian Sandoval Not sure if anyone had this issue after update on 6P? I have a hidden network for my wifi and device once updated will no longer connect to it. Ján “Johnny” Valentík This new build fixed for me Google Play Music inside Android Auto on my Pixel XL. In 0.17 I couldn't play any music nor the widget with controls would show... Mattsus The OTA update worked for me this morning(UK time), this is coming directly from an OTA update from Nougat to O Dev Preview 2, can confirm Android Pay now works. neon tiger Have you tried actually using it or just opening the app ? Mattsus I've tried both opening the app, adding new card details as old one expired yesterday, and using it against several terminals. Can confirm no issues thus far. Before update, opening the app wouldn't work but was able to pay using it no problem at all. Joshua Lillis I guess I'm lucky, took the beta OTA from 7.1.2, and now took the .019 OTA just fine. Couldn't flash a factory image if I wanted to, damn Verizon. mieszk3 Nexus 5X 019 OTA: https://android.googleapis.com/packages/ota-api/google_bullhead_bullhead/44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip Rowan I tried to install it today on my Nexus 6p and a error message came up. I thought it was about to start boot looping but it turned on minutes later to my releif Besnik Rrustemi It worked for me on my Nexus 6P. But maybe it is because i was on 7.1.2 and updated to DP2 the moment they announced it on live Google I/O (0.17 build) and after the first update the 0.19 installed without problem, So maybe the issue is updating directly from 7.1.2 to DP2 0.19 ? jon Hutchinson The update failed on my Nexus 6p. Though android pay began to work. Double edge sword though I'm glad my android pay is restored. I'm still on 0.17. Updated over OTA and even for a factory reset while on Android o. iftekhar bongo my nexus 5x showing error while installing upate... any solution? Leroy This latest build seems to cause problems with safetynet. Stock phones are registered as 'uncertified' in the play store and Android pay doesn't work because the devices are rooted, only they're not.. Small OTA received over the beta factory images on 5X.. Device is marked as uncertified now lol https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidPreviews/comments/6c0bsg/small_ota_received_over_the_beta_factory_images/ neon tiger Yeah my banking app won't let me use fingerprint login because of this. Leroy Yeah it's really annoying. Hopefully they can fix it on their end without. Would be a shame is we have to reflash 017 build or wait for next OTA to fix it. compuguy1088 Same here on the PixelXL. I'm sure they will update SafetyNet soon enough to fix this. wickets So, next question....when are they fixing PIP?? :) Ernie My Nexus 6p also got an error trying to update from . 17 to. 19 as well. Cache wipe didn't solve the problem either. Any other tricks? Alex Kruger I installed the update via OTA on my Pixel XL, now I can open Android Pay, but I can't add any cards because it thinks my bootloader is unlocked. It's not, I've done everything through the official OTA channel. nextelnutt I received the update and got the dead Android error. However, my build number did indicate .019, then 25 minutes ago, I noticed the update was available again for my 6P. So I downloaded and installed again and device restarted fine. As for Android Pay, I will try it when I am out shopping today. Robert Macdonald Play store now showing as uncertified, Android pay loads but says cannot be used. Otherwise it installed just fine on my pixel. Andreas Constantinides 6p here, got the issue. JoeInMO On my Pixel XL I get "Android Pay can't be used on this device." I'm not rooted or bootloader unlocked. I never had Pay set up before. Matty032 I have the same error. Maxime Labrecque-Raymond Got the issue and my DOTs dosen't work Nexus 6P blacleyeX2 The OTA Nexus 6P failed, but I can confirm that Android Pay is now working and I have used it for a transaction. Not sure how that worked, any ideas? Marty Got the error. 6P. blacleyeX2 The available images are only for the images ending 17 and not the new 19, so we can't side load yet. mieszk3 All of you with unlocked bootloader -> manually flash via fastboot: bootloader, boot, radio and recovery and then 019 OTA will work. (Probably only bootloader is necessary). Marty Firmware not available yet. mieszk3 Use 017 version, then sideload 019 OTA Marty "Factory image and OTA downloads are not yet available." mieszk3 Nexus 5X 017->019 OTA: https://disq.us/url?url=https%3A%2F%2Fandroid.googleapis.com%2Fpackages%2Fota-api%2Fgoogle_bullhead_bullhead%2F44bdd4f9967717bad5ef82a54c1dbf2c1ba92fa1.zip%3AgIXISwZNuhjf2FlMgjO4Va15Lr0&cuid=1370072 Firmwares: https://developer.android.com/preview/download.html Marty I was just contrasting what you said with what the article said. I'm not desperate to update my 6P. I don't use it anymore. Ultra Sage My nexus 5x worked fine for the first few hours. Then when this update came out, I tried installing it but my phone kept on crashing and restarting after every few minutes. It was not bootloop since I could receive calls, but if I opened anything else, then it would crash and restart. I finally managed to use terminal to unlock the boot loader and restore nougat factory image, since the OTA download would stall the screen, and it would restart. I was a beta tester for Nougat, but this was a bad experience. Kris Fannin Same issue with my Nexus 6P. Update fails. Just another data point for you and thanks for the information. ctk4949 I was about to switch back to my Pixel XL from my S8+. But when I tried connecting my Gear S3 watch, it wouldn't open the app. It force closes each time. :( Matt McNair After the update Android Pay will launch but I just tried to pay with it and I get a message stating that my Pixel XL isn't eligible. Had to pull out the ole wallet. StW I tried to apply this update twice on my Nexus 6P but each time the updated failed near the beginning of the install. However, yesterday Android Pay was not working (unsupported developer version message) but today, even though the install failed, Android Pay works. Cael Android Pay works on my Pixel XL after receiving this update. Ernie I think Google might have pulled the . 19 update for the Nexus 6p. I haven't gotten a notification for the update for almost 2 hours now. EnerJi I still have a notification pending on my Nexus 5X. I wonder if that means it's been fixed on the 5X? I've been holding off on trying it until I see some folks confirm that it works for people who OTAd from 7.1.2. Matty032 At first I got the root error with Android pay. But, I cleared cache and then restarted the phone. I was then able to complete the transaction. Works now. That's after Google Chat Support told me it wouldn't work with O. LOL Ian Kumlien 019 ota is up and will apply on a 017 Android O OTA (as in N -> O) phone via ADB sideload Guilherme Noronha Just got the update notification again after failing​ to install this morning. The version is the same, but now it's a 1047MB download. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9000c49c9403d0d934b43f20e78a43675548972a522f62b370ca9822f5b69643.png Guilherme Noronha Just installed the 1047MB OTA. It installed successfully and build number went up to .019 OkieDokie Awesome news. My 6P is downloading a much bigger .019 OTA as well, this time it is 1053.3 MB so hopefully this one works like it did for your 5X. satyendra karn It is working now. For my Nexus 6P, Installation​ size got changed from 55 mb to 1053.3 mb for build no .019. Dr Maario For me, the update cost 1053,3MB RobVdm I got the small update yesterday and it didn't install. Just now I received a bigger one (1GB). Hopefully this will fix it. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7aac1aa45ceac04c15cf1394c549307120b4151768e693d068d79f759450192e.png Domingos Ferreira Re appeared for my 6p but the size now if of 1053.3 MB Domingos Ferreira And installed correctly.. but was way too fast to be a 1gb update.. weird Follow Android Police 1.49M 470k 144k 116k Latest Deals 18 [Deal Alert] Here are 12 temporarily free and 6 on-sale apps for your post-I/O weekend 2017/05/19 12:59pm PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Samsung Gear 360 1st gen down to $168.55 on Amazon 2017/05/19 2:06am PDTMay 19, 2017 4 [Deal Alert] Get a UE ROLL 2 Bluetooth speaker in Sugarplum for just $45 ($55 off) on Amazon 2017/05/18 8:12pm PDTMay 18, 2017 1 [Deal Alert] Celebrate the start of Google I/O with 9 temporarily free and 10 on-sale apps, plus both 0.10 Apps of the Week 2017/05/17 9:09am PDTMay 17, 2017 10 [Deal Alert] Get $50 off the new HTC U11 with promo code 2017/05/17 3:40am PDTMay 17, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Source: Supplied The job, if you're up for it, comes with bleak warnings of ongoing exposure to child pornography, animal cruelty, beheadings, violent deaths and ubiquitous dick pics. Uniquely gruelling, the role of social media moderator is not for everyone. Tucked away and hidden far from the shiny sprawling campuses of the tech giants in Silicon Valley, there is relatively little known about the business of social media moderation. What is certain is that it is a rapidly growing industry. Imagery and videos the moderators handled was "designed to entertain the most twisted and sick minded people in the world", according to a 2017 lawsuit filed against Microsoft by two of its moderators. Source: Supplied The mission of the few companies operating in this sphere is to scrub the world's biggest social media sites and mobile apps of all the things Mark Zuckerberg and his tech billionaire pals don't want you to see on your morning commute. An army of employees, mostly located in India and Philippines work fastidiously 24/7 to put the stoppers on illicit, illegal and disturbing content. It is a secretive business of non-disclosure agreements and tightly controlled information over who is working for who. An estimated 150,000 people work as social media moderators - more than double Google's head count and dwarfing the ranks of Facebook almost nine times over. Ciaran Cassidy, an Irish filmmaker, wanted to know what that world looked like. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at Facebook's F8 Developer Conference during April, 2017. Source: AFP He was motivated to investigate after reading a 2014 expose in Wired. Inside that story, written by an undercover journalist, two moderators working in the Philippines are flippantly discussing beheading videos. It jarred, the way ISIL's shocking terror propaganda had become banal for hardworking, lowly paid people who are exposed to the worst the internet can throw up. Wanting in was one thing, getting in was another. Cassidy told nine.com.au his requests to the big multi-national operators located in Bangalore - companies like Infosys, Oracle – were either knocked back or flat out ignored. He kept trying and eventually got access. Foiwe Info Global Solutions, a smaller player, but one of the first companies to set up in the moderation market, invited Cassidy to their Bangalore base. "There are people in India, Indonesia, the Philippines who sit in a warehouse who have to sift through this very stressing material to make sure that we don't," Ciaran Cassidy, documentary maker, told nine.com.au. Source: Supplied A trainer at Foiwe explains to a room of new recruits what they can expect to see in their role of social media moderators. Source: Supplied On that first morning, Cassidy and Field of Vision co-director Adrian Chen, plonked themselves down near an empty desk in the company's training room. The computer monitor spewed up a stream of flagged content. "A lot of graphic material was popping up on the computer and I felt quite awkward sitting there," Cassidy told nine.com.au. "You could see some of the stuff that might be coming across their screens, like child abuse and porn. And you're wondering how that would affect you." It causes an extreme psychological impact, according to two US-based internet moderators who filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, their employer, in January of this this year. The pair said having to watch child abuse, bestiality and "inhumane and disgusting content" over and over caused Post-Traumatic Stress disorder. The imagery and videos the moderators were confronted with were "designed to entertain the most twisted and sick minded people in the world", the complaint outlined. Microsoft, the two workers said, had not adequately warned them about what the job entailed. The Seattle-based firm rejected the claims their "wellness program" designed to support its moderators was insufficient. Facebook's roughly 1.7 billion users upload around 350 million images every day, and a deluge of 85 million new photographs and videos hits Instagram daily. Source: Supplied. Facebook's roughly 1.7 billion users upload around 350 million images every day, and a deluge of 85 million new photographs and videos hits Instagram daily. Zuckerberg and the tech elite are sitting on multi-billion-dollar goldmines and they don't want the user experience or public perception derailed by illicit content. "Most giant internet tech companies have these images, and their brand is bright and optimistic," Cassidy said. "Their employees sit on beanbags and they bring people together. The existence of content moderation is the dark side of that, and I think it's one that maybe they wouldn't be that welcome about a light being shone on. "There are people in India, Indonesia, the Philippines who sit in a warehouse who have to sift through this very stressing material to make sure that we don't." Going completely against the flow of its competitors, Foiwe allowed Cassidy and Chen to put their cameras wherever they wanted, and speak to any employees they liked. Cassidy found Foiwe's transparency was refreshing, and at the same time disturbing. "They didn't try and control us," Cassidy said. "I wondered what was going on in these bigger, shadier places. What's going on at all the places that wouldn't speak to us or allow us in? There may be a lot more disturbing material that people have to view." Clocks dialed into world's different time zones hang on the wall at Foiwe. The Bangalore company has clients in the Americas, Russia, Europe, Asia and India. Source: Supplied Young, well-educated and smart, Bangalore-native Suman Howlader, the chief executive who founded Foiwe in 2010, was one of the pioneers in India's social moderation industry. He told nine.com.au how Fortune 500 IT companies (Oracle, Infosys, Congizant) had recently set up huge social content moderation divisions in Bangalore. Howlader would not tell nine.com.au who his specific US and European clients were, but he did reveal the sectors: social media, matchmaking and dating, e-commerce and media companies. Most of Howlader's employees are Hindus; Arranged marriages are still commonplace in India, and even dating outside of marriage can be a delicate cultural matter at many family dinner tables, he said. Anyone wanting to work at Foiwe must spend one week being slowly introduced to the worst of the West's internet behaviours. They will then spend six weeks training to become a social media moderator. Foiwe's moderators typically assess around 120 images per hour. Foiwe's content moderators will typically assess around 120 images per hour. Source: Supplied "We do not force the moderators to look at each and everything. It is up to the comfort level of each moderator," Howlader said. Regular counselling, especially during the six-week training program, is essential to retaining workers, according to Howlader. He admits the attrition rate can be high. "We tend to hire computer science engineers who at a certain point at time will have spent a lot of time on the internet, to already be exposed to this kind of content online. That is the key," he said. Watching a fatal Russian car accident on YouTube can significantly distress some people for as long as a month afterwards, Lauren Monds, a psychology researcher at Sydney University, told nine.com.au. A lack of proper support for content moderators to mentally and emotionally decompress can lead to PTSD, depression, substance abuse, she added.

Source: AFP Monds explained that, without a coherent narrative, such as in the role of content moderation, the impact of being exposed to haunting and shocking imagery is amplified. If someone watches a dog being beaten with a stick but doesn't later get to see that animal being rescued by people then the experience and lasting effect is markedly different, Monds said. "It's quite an extraordinary existence," documentary maker Cassidy said after observing the moderators in action over the course of one week. "What I find shocking almost in a weird way is it is a very normal office environment. They're all regular people that everybody can identify with. They have the same kind of jokes in the canteen. "It could have been an office environment that wouldn't have looked out of place in Dublin or Melbourne or anywhere in the world."

Josh Miller/CNET Drones by Joshua Goldman May 20, 2017 7:00 AM PDT @ByJoshG Over the past couple years there's been a steady stream of stories about unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), aka drones, being used for deliveries. There was the Domino's Pizza delivery in New Zealand, the 77 7-Eleven drops to customers in Reno, Nevada, and Google parent company Alphabet's Chipotle burrito shipments to Virginia Tech students, to name a few. Click for more stories. Aaron Robinson/CNET Though these deliveries were basically public tests used to gather data -- and attract attention -- for the companies behind them, I can't help but think using such amazing machines for personal deliveries is a little ridiculous. Along with that, there are so many hurdles -- from airspace congestion and regulations, to payload weight and flight-time limitations, to weather conditions -- that it's just not efficient or economical when, in general, a single car, van or truck can accomplish much more. For example, Amazon's Prime Air service, currently in beta testing in the UK, is limited to customers within several miles of a shipping facility for packages weighing less than five pounds (2.3 kg). Not only does this limit what can be delivered and to whom, it's not even possible in the US with current FAA restrictions, which includes keeping the drone in line of sight while flying -- defeating the purpose of aerial delivery. OK, so delivering pizza isn't the thing that makes drones really valuable and cool, but here's what is: quickly delivering emergency food, medicine and supplies in disaster zones, to rural and remote areas, up mountains or out in the ocean. Delivery drones that can get where trucks and pricey helicopters can't will become indispensable. They're not only going to save time and money, they'll save lives. Safety first UPS partners for drone deliveries in Rwanda Drones delivering vital medical supplies to Rwanda will take to the skies in July 2016. UPS has partnered with drone company Zipline to deliver blood and vaccines. by Lexy Savvides 2:32 Close Drag Autoplay: ON Autoplay: OFF Though not as attention-grabbing as burritos for college students, UPS and drone maker CyPhy Works staged a delivery from Beverly, Massachusetts to an island three miles off the Atlantic coast to deliver an inhaler to a child on the island. Likewise, delivery service Flirtey, the company behind the 7-Eleven deliveries, has also demonstrated how its drones can be used for ship-to-shore deliveries of life-saving aid to coastal regions. Land Rover's Project Hero combines a roof-mounted drone for disaster response with a new 2017 Discovery SUV and is currently being used by the Austrian Red Cross. Then there's Zipline, which is already making medical deliveries by drone to hospitals across Rwanda. Along with saving lives, commercial delivery drones are going to be able to keep things like utilities and manufacturing plants up and and running when systems need to be repaired or parts replaced. Instead of waiting days for a part to arrive, a delivery drone can be given a flight plan and sent on its way, all on its own. There are companies working on the commercial drone hurdles I mentioned earlier, too. On May 5, a Nevada UAV consortium set a record flying a fixed-wing drone nearly 100 miles for a package delivery using cellular connectivity. Similarly, Qualcomm has been running trials using 4G LTE networks to safely guide UAVs beyond visual line of sight and below 400 feet. What this will eventually mean is that deliveries will be more accurate and safer via a constant commercial mobile network connection between the operator and the drone, and those deliveries can happen at greater distances. And, NASA just announced new technology it developed for autonomous crash management to potentially help delivery drones land safely in highly populated areas should something go wrong. In the end, the technologies used in delivery drones are going to be the same regardless of their cargo. I guess I'm just hoping the next time you see a story about a drone delivering sunscreen, you sit back and think about how that same flying robot is capable of delivering so much more.

However once the update is downloading, there’s really nothing you do about it which can sometimes prove to be inconvenient. However in a report from Android Police, Google is making some changes to that and will actually allow users to pause system updates in the future. While it was initially thought to be an Android O feature, Google engineer Elliott Hughes posted on Google+ suggested that it is part of a change in the Play Store that was being tested internally before anyone really noticed, but presumably it should roll out on a wider basis with Android O. Hughes also clarifies that this feature won’t just be limited to huge system updates, but small files as well. However he states that this might not be so apparent since smaller files tend to download quicker, meaning that users probably won’t notice until it’s already been downloaded in which there would be no more point in pausing it. Either way it does sound like an immensely useful feature so if you do want the feature then keep an eye out for its availability in the near future. Filed in Cellphones.

Rematch of man vs machine in ancient game Dan Martin, Agence France-Presse Posted at May 21 2017 12:40 PM Share Save Facebook Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo will face the world's top-ranked Go player, China's 19-year-old Ke Jie, in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI . Ed Jones, AFP SHANGHAI - It's man vs machine this week as Google's artificial intelligence program AlphaGo faces the world's top-ranked Go player in a contest expected to end in another victory for rapid advances in AI. China's 19-year-old Ke Jie is given little chance in the three-game series beginning Tuesday in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen after AlphaGo stunned observers last year by trouncing South Korean grand master Lee Se-Dol four games to one. Lee's loss in Seoul marked the first time a computer program had beaten a top player in a full match in the 3,000-year-old Chinese board game, and has been hailed as a landmark event in the development of AI. AI has previously beaten humans in cerebral contests, starting with IBM's Deep Blue defeating chess grand master Garry Kasparov in 1997, but AlphaGo's win last year is considered the most significant win for AI yet. Go is considered perhaps the most complex game ever devised, with an incomputable number of move options that puts a premium on "intuition." Proponents had considered it a bastion in which human thought would remain superior, at least for the foreseeable future. AlphaGo's triumph fueled hopes of a brave new world in which AI is applied not only to driver-less cars or "smart homes", but to helping mankind figure out some of the most complex scientific, technical, and medical problems. "AlphaGo's successes hint at the possibility for general AI to be applied to a wide range of tasks and areas, to perhaps find solutions to problems that we as human experts may not have considered," Demis Hassabis, founder of London-based DeepMind, which developed AlphaGo, said ahead of this week's matches. AI's ultimate goal is to create "general" or multi-purpose, rather than "narrow," task-specific intelligence -- something resembling human reasoning and the ability to learn. SCI-FI NIGHTMARE  But for some, it conjures sci-fi images of a future in which machines "wake up" and enslave humanity. Physicist Stephen Hawking is a leading voice for caution, warning in 2015 that computers may outsmart humans, "potentially subduing us with weapons we cannot even understand." Ke faces AlphaGo on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Ke is a brash prodigy who went pro at 11 years old, has been world number one for more than two years, and has described himself as a "pretentious prick". After AlphaGo flattened Lee, Ke declared he would never lose to the machine. "Bring it on," he said on China's Twitter-like Weibo. But he has tempered his bravado since then. Ke was among many top Chinese players who were trounced in online contests in January by a mysterious adversary who reportedly won 60 straight victories. That opponent -- cheekily calling itself "The Master" -- was later revealed by DeepMind to have been an updated AlphaGo. "Even that was not AlphaGo's best performance," Gu Li, a past national champion, told Chinese state media last week. "It would be very hard for Ke to play against it, but then again, Ke has also been working extremely hard to change his methods in preparation. I hope he can play well." Go involves two players alternately laying black and white stones on a grid. The winner is the player who seals off the most territory. AlphaGo uses two sets of "deep neural networks" containing millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught -- having played millions of games against itself after initial programming.  Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Read More:  Google   AlphaGo   DeepMind   artificial intelligence   technology   /business/12/16/16/artificial-intelligence-creeps-into-daily-life /business/05/16/17/artificial-intelligence-to-give-humans-superpowers-says-ai-innovator /video/life/03/03/17/artificial-intelligence-in-ph-threat-or-tool LATEST NEWS MOST READ Maja rocks Araneta with 'Twerk it Like Miley' May 21, 2017 Pulis patay sa pamamaril sa piyesta May 21, 2017 JaDine, sizzling sa tub photo May 21, 2017 Retiradong heneral, bagong MMDA chairman May 21, 2017 Makati govt settles P900-M debt to BIR May 21, 2017 Magnitude 4.2 quake jolts Davao Oriental May 21, 2017 Kathryn, Liza, Janella, Julia sing 'Sit Still, Look Pretty' on 'ASAP' May 21, 2017 Mga batang inabuso, inilahok sa circus para makarekober May 21, 2017 Fajardo foresees 'good problem' as national team setter May 21, 2017 TPP trade deal members agree to seek way forward without US May 21, 2017 DOST, hinihikayat ang Pinoy scientists na bumalik ng bansa May 21, 2017 Komedyante, nabiktima ng akyat-bahay sa QC May 21, 2017 Finance chief eyes DBP as infra bank to support 'Dutertenomics' May 21, 2017 Bahagi ng Las Piñas, 12-oras na mawawalan ng tubig May 21, 2017 De Lima asks Senate to let her vote on 'crucial' bills May 21, 2017 Jessy Mendiola reacts to initial results of FHM 'sexiest' poll LOOK: James, Nadine in intimate tub photo Henry Sy's successor shares 5 rules to success Scottie Thompson gushes over Liza; girlfriend reacts Pippa Middleton, from bridesmaid now a bride LTFRB: Bawal ang rosaryo sa rearview mirror, signages sa windshield ng jeepney IN PHOTOS: The frontrunners on FHM's 'sexiest' list Away ng dalawang angkan, nauwi sa patayan Nadine leads FHM 'sexiest' poll; Jessy lags outside Top 10 'The Voice Teens': Lea, Sarah gush over young crooner After adopting girl without limbs, US couple's adopted Filipino son battles Big C 85-anyos na lalaki, napatay umano ng sariling anak LOOK: Bollywood's Aishwarya Rai shines in Michael Cinco gown NBA: James snubbed as MVP award finalist Pagbabawal sa rosaryo at abubot sa dashboard, windshield, binatikos BRAND NEWS 5 ways to stay fresh this summer Love me pretty VIRAL: 5 reasons why this "Sunday Ba Ngayon?" video made millions cry VIRAL: Tear-jerker shows a mother's unconditional love Want a romantic treat for mom this Mother’s Day?

Correa is currently in Lyft's Express Drive rental program, a partnership with GM which allows a weekly rental, available for up to eight weeks. Rider sharing companies, such as Uber and Lyft have launched rental, leases and financing deals to have more drivers, but critics say drivers are paying high and even predatory prices. (AP Photo/Tae-Gyun Kim) Uber drivers have been complaining that the gap between the fare a rider pays and what the driver receives is getting wider. After months of unsatisfying answers, Uber Technologies is providing an explanation: It’s charging some passengers more because it needs the extra cash. The change stems from a feature introduced last year called upfront pricing. By guaranteeing a certain fare before customers book, Uber said, it provides more transparency. But it continued paying drivers using the old model, a combination of mileage, time and multipliers based on geographic demand. The difference between those two calculations could be the future of Uber’s business. Daniel Graf, Uber’s head of product, said upfront pricing couldn’t be summed up in a simple formula. Uber applies machine-learning techniques to estimate how much groups of customers are willing to shell out for a ride, calculating riders’ propensity for paying a higher price for a particular route at a certain time of day, he said. For instance, someone traveling from a wealthy neighborhood to another tony spot might be asked to pay more than another person heading to a poorer part of town, even if demand, traffic and distance are the same. Uber calls this “route-based pricing.” Uber began on Friday communicating the changes to drivers. It will start reporting the price a passenger pays on each ride, though it will stop breaking out its percentage of the fare. It will also send an updated terms of service agreement reflecting the new fee system to drivers. Route-based pricing is now limited to 14 cities where Uber offers its carpooling service. Graf said Uber’s pricing techniques had grown incredibly sophisticated. He oversees a team called marketplace at headquarters in San Francisco that’s staffed with economists and statisticians. Graf, a former Google and Twitter executive, sees financial engineering as a competitive advantage, one way that Uber can stay ahead of Lyft and other ride-hailing operators. “Google search is very simple to do; it’s very complex what’s happening behind the scenes,” Graf said. “The same thing here. Taking a trip is easy. To make this all work in a whole market, and sustainable, is really, really hard.” In the process, pricing became something of a black box for passengers and another source of tension with drivers. Drivers accused Uber of cutting them out of income they were entitled to and misleading them about its plans. During the last year, Uber had attributed price discrepancies to the uncertainty around estimating fares, even as it was experimenting with techniques designed to exploit the imbalance between what customers were willing to pay and what drivers would take. The Rideshare Guy, a popular blog among drivers, conducted a study in New York City published in May, finding widespread disparities between rider fares and driver pay. Workers weren’t happy. “It is immoral and unethical behavior,” said Chris Estrada, who drives for Uber in Riverside, Calif. Uber has faced a torrent of scandals this year, including a trade secrets lawsuit, sexual harassment allegations, a brief boycott over its ties to the administration of President Donald Trump and a video showing the chief executive officer arguing with a driver over falling fares. Two of the longest-running criticisms of the seven-year-old company are ones that are sometimes at odds: It loses too much money, and it pays drivers too little. The company told Bloomberg in April that it lost $2.8 billion in 2016, excluding its China business. In the case of upfront pricing, Uber may move closer to resolving investors’ concerns about losses but could alienate drivers along the way. “You know our numbers,” Graf said. “We do want to run and operate a sustainable business.” Uber said it wasn’t hoarding the additional revenue generated from route-based pricing but was reinvesting much of it into increasing the number of trips, subsidizing UberPool usage and paying bonuses to drivers. Christian Perea, who writes for the Rideshare Guy, said drivers would appreciate the added transparency about how much passengers are paying. “That is a big deal,” he said. Public pay: Compare government and teacher salaries for St. Louis area Company headquarters that have moved from St. Louis Meet the best small businesses to work at in St. Louis How do they stack up? Compare pay of top St. Louis executives As Uber experiments with pricing models, complexity could introduce new problems. “Society is more willing to accept wealthy people paying higher fares,” said Chris Knittel, a business professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. “But if the repercussion of lower fares in lower-income places is longer wait times, that’s probably what they want to keep an eye on.” With such a dramatic change to pricing, it’s not just drivers Uber has to worry about upsetting. “They could really lose the trust of the riders,” said Glen Weyl, a senior researcher at Microsoft who is studying Uber with the company’s cooperation. Microsoft is an investor in Uber. “It’s a very dangerous moment for them, but there are good economic reasons to do it.” Uber is a company filled with over-optimizers who will continue to tinker with prices in hopes of finding equilibrium. “If things are not balanced, we create levers to motivate people to make it balanced again,” Graf said. “There’s choices, right? Always. There’s never, ‘I have to use Uber.’” Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business. Get twice-daily updates on what the St. Louis business community is talking about.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 21 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Follow these tips to widen your organic reach on Facebook This article was originally published on PR Daily in May 2016. If you want to make your head spin, Google „Facebook organic reach is dead.” It’s a one-way ticket to a world of irreconcilable opinions. „Abandon ship; organic reach is dead!” versus, „No, wait; Facebook is still a land of opportunity!” It’s more than a little difficult trying to figure out who’s right—especially because in a lot of ways, everyone is right (and everyone is wrong, too). Though there’s no arguing that Facebook has offered diminishing returns for businesses and marketers over the years, that’s a symptom of growth with any relatively young, increasingly competitive medium. That’s why I made the conscious decision to stop paying attention to both sides of the organic reach argument. Instead of allowing myself to be passive and feel helpless in the face of declining reach, I learned how to adapt to Facebook’s changes before they happen—and to refocus my strategy on statistics that affect my bottom line a lot more than reach ever did. Here’s how I shifted focus, and where you can start: Stay up to date on algorithm changes Facebook uses complex algorithms to determine how much organic reach to give your updates. If you pay attention, every now and then they’ll give you an inside peek at what they’re looking for. Facebook’s newsroom periodically shares news about upcoming algorithm changes, so savvy marketers can start adjusting their social media strategies ahead of time. Share the right kind of content, and Facebook might reward you with better reach. Post the wrong kind of content, and that reach could tank. For example, in autumn 2014, Facebook announced that it was going to start favoring link posts with images attached over photo posts with URLs in their captions. As of February 2015, link posts were getting as much as three times the organic reach of photo posts—and because I had adjusted my strategy months prior, I’d been reaping the benefits for a long time. If I hadn’t known, I might have been wasting my time and energy on posting the wrong types of content, as a lot of organizations were doing. Keep an eye out for Facebook’s announcements regarding algorithm changes, and you can stay ahead of the curve. RELATED: Join us at Facebook HQ for the Social Media and Storytelling Summit.] Watch your own data When are some of the best times to post on Facebook? Around noon? Just after dinner time? Weekdays, weekends? Actually, the best times to post on Facebook depend entirely on you and your audience; that’s not an answer you’ll find in a blog post. Instead of scouring the Web for tips about hot times to post, stay on your own Facebook page; that’s where all the answers are. Your page’s Insights tab will provide a wealth of information about your users, including the days and times when they’re online. You can also sort your posts according to which ones got the most engagement and which had the highest reach, so you can determine not just when you should post, but what you should post. I’ve found that these statistics exhibit some ebb and flow as my audience and its habits change over time, so I monitor them periodically and use my findings to continually refine and refocus my posting habits. Variables such as my ideal posting times and my most popular content aren’t always consistent, but by checking my statistics regularly, I can eliminate a considerable amount of guesswork and have an easier time posting when it counts the most. Ignore misleading statistics Statistic taken out of context can be dangerous, so think twice before listening to the wisdom of the crowd. Case in point: Most consumers say brand managers should post to Facebook just once or twice per day. Should you take their advice? Absolutely not. Consider that the average organic reach on Facebook is about 7 percent—a statistic that most consumers probably aren’t aware of. If you post only twice a day, you might be reaching about one-seventh of your followers at best. Facebook’s algorithms mean that most of your fans won’t see any given update you share. Depending on the types of updates you post, you could share 10 in a day and still reach only about half your fans. So although they might want to see only one or two posts from you in a single day, you would have to post significantly more frequently than once or twice to hit that mark. The solution I’ve implemented has been to save my social media updates and re-share them over time. This makes it easier to maintain a heavy posting schedule (posting as many as 20 updates per day, across different social media networks), and it ensures that every update gets multiple chances to find its audience. Why throw away a perfectly good Facebook update when 93 percent of your audience didn’t even see it? Keep these points in mind, and not only will you worry less about whether organic reach on Facebook is „dead,” but you’ll also watch your own organic reach improve over time.
