Google announces Family Link, a tool for creating and managing Google accounts for kids under 13 Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/15 9:55am PDTMar 15, 2017 123 Plus 1 on G+ 311 Share on Facebook 92 Share on Twitter Total Shares526 Google News Google has never allowed anyone under the age of 13 to have a Google account, and certainly no one would ever lie about their age on the internet. Right? Well, now you don't have to lie with the new Family Link app. Family Link (invite-only and US-only for now) lets you create a Google account for your under-13 offspring with advanced parental controls built-in. There are some caveats, but this seems like a tool many parents will be anxious to check out. Setting up a Family Link account for your kid can only be done through the Family Link app, which is also what you use to manage the account and monitor device activity. One major drawback is that your child needs to be using a Nougat phone, but you can use Family Link to tightly control that device. It includes screen time tracking, bedtime schedules, and app rating limits. When setting up an account, you will be asked to pay $0.30. This isn't a blatant cash grab by Google—the FTC requires verifiable parental consent when collecting personal information about kids, and credit card payments are the easiest approved method. You could "object" to collection after seeing the charge on your account. Family Link is only for kids under the age of 13, but you have options as soon as the child hits that age. Parents and kids can keep using Family Link if they like. However, Google will reach out and give the birthday boy or girl the option of transitioning to a regular Google account, over which their parents have no control. I imagine most will take Google up on that offer. I hear teenagers are rebellious. If you want to check out Family Link, request an invite from the landing page. There's also some additional legal info you can review if you're feeling a little skittish about feeding your child's data into the gaping maw of Google.

Wife and I were just discussing parental oversight on smartphones. This is the perfect time for this beta for me! Hope the invites come soon. Bill Stebbins The kid's device must be running Nougat 7.0? I'd suspect this is missing a huge population of kids using hand-me-down devices (including mine). Mike in KC Well just buy a new device, problem solved 😉.... Lol, yeah I immediately thought the same thing. dxdydz Now you guys have an excuse to upgrade sooner! Arturo Campos Yeah, that's simply ridiculous silver_arrow Probably some nougat tech that lets them do this. Also it's an issue now but wait 2-3 years and you're golden. RyanWhitwam It won't seem as ridiculous in a few months. Cheap Nougat phones will happen. Probably no way to make these features work on Marshmallow. Bill Stebbins Agreed. My youngest will turn 13 in a year, so it won't benefit me, and I agree they have to start somewhere. Hopefully they will have an amnesty program for us to "correct" our kid's existing accounts jlatimer11 I'm pretty much in the same boat. By the time they get phones that could use it they'll be 13 and 14. Kyle Or just find a hand me down phoine that will support a nougat ROM, if you are able to do that. Bill Stebbins Wanna take any bets on this not supporting rooted devices? Kyle I don't doubt there will be some shenanagins like that. But you would think that the G would be happy that their later OS's are being used, even if it is not on the latest flagships. JSo I thought this was going to be something that would link families together between devices. Like a way to share things easier between family members, connect to people that are close to you better and stuff like that. This is just a parental control app. Bradley Ruiz so all the games/progress already installed using my account on his device are gone after setting a new account :S SavageJeep They still have the Family Library ability if it works for you... https://play.google.com/store/family/create?hl=en F4LL0U7 Awesome, now my wife and I can officially start trying to get pregnant, with the knowledge that our child will be born with their own Google account! (Yes, that is important to me!) Tim Stevens Great...so than everyone knows how old the kids are using their "kids" account...nice for people who like little children...i dont even feel safe on my own account...they know everything about a person these days....i rather lie about their birthday and check my kids behaviour myself once in a while... Nougat is easy...install a rom. Vantius > Nougat is easy...install a rom. Not if you're a non-tech literate parent and just want a service to do that. iZi My kids are 101 and 104 years old... :p I hope I will be able to change their age when they turn 113! Iain Mabbott Great idea (apart from the whole US only and Nougat requirements!) MJ Why do kids under 13 need phones or Google accounts? INCOMING! archie27 my kids are issued a school account (g-suite) in 5th grade (age ~10). MJ OK? That's fine if the school uses Android tablets or Chromebooks in class. brekfest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4vkVHijdQk Google already answered the question years ago. codemonkey85 Honestly, no one at any age "needs" those things. :-P That said, my son had an email address the day after he was born. I've got a lot of ideas for how to structure family stuff using apps like Todoist and Google Calendar! MJ Cool... My kids (that will never exist) would have to show basic proficiently with the command line before their first tablet or Windows PC. :-) Vantius You sound like a heartless dick. MJ Yes, it's heartless to have your kids learn something. You are obviously from the gimme I am entitled generation. Your kids don't have a smartphones and they are 8 years old? Child abuse! codemonkey85 Haha, to each his own. I say embrace the future - my kids probably won't know devices existed without touch screens. MJ I have been embracing the future for almost 50 years now. I would think parents would want their kids to learn how tech works and just not play with it. codemonkey85 I thought you were okay until that last remark about food service. You can have an opinion without being a dick. MJ Dude, I am just stating a truth. The workplace is a global competition now. In China, kids are learning advanced math, coding, and how tech actually works before high school. Many educational institutions actually think just putting consumer devices like tablets in schools will some how make kids prepared for the future. Skills like typing, writing/penmanship, and being able to properly verbally communicate (stuff rarely talked about these days) is what is going to set the young people of the future apart from their peers NOT being on the latest social network. Hell, you know so many kids today don't know how to properly shake a hand? That's like the first step in gaining respect in a business situation. Learning how to do things manually or the "hard" way is always useful even if just do it once. I have been driving a automatic transmission since like 21 but I know how to drive a manual shift. I am sure you know why that may be a good idea. Rant over... codemonkey85 I don't disagree, but if you insult my children or my parenting of course I'm going to dismiss you. That being said, I'm a professional developer (mostly C#) and I very rarely need to use command-line tools, and there *are* still jobs that don't require advanced computer science. In any case I think my kids will figure it out, just like I did. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I agree. i think an old school flipphone AT MOST. Jax Spade Needed this when I got my son a phone... Now he just has a full account and everything already set up. They should have done something like this years ago. archie27 need this to work on chromebooks too Zach Mauch Honestly, we need Andromeda with google controlled updates so all devices are instantly on the same OS/version and compatible. Way too much fragmentation with Google. Steve Galbincea "Family Link is not available for your account at this time." Sigh. Hopefully one day Google will get things right. resource Getting this too. Any idea why some people are being told their account isn't eligible? Dn Bro I may have missed an edit in this article, but it does state in the article it is invite only...Just saying. Markus Eyrich U.S. only..pfff m-p{3} Might not be a technological issue, but a legal one. HotRodJohnson What if your child already has an account via Google Education? Does it allow a linkup to those accounts? David Hyman As well as migrating an existing email account to this. We have emails for both of our kids so we can send them emails like that Gmail commercial from years past. I would definitely like to get them onto this family link thing if possible codemonkey85 "One major drawback is that your child needs to be using a Nougat phone" ...Seriously? I thought Google was a services company. My two-year-old son is not getting a brand new Nougat phone so I can set up an email address for him for when he's older. Abhilash Bingi A used Nexus 5X isn't all that expensive? Adam Margeson A used Nexus 5 is even less. Abhilash Bingi It might be a bit too old and doesn't have Nougat officially. Adam Margeson Fair point. I occasionally forget that some people don't use custom ROMs. I've been using it since I heard about CM when I had my Dream (HTC G1), so it's something I always consider an option as a knee-jerk reaction. codemonkey85 I don't like custom ROMS. They tend to break things. codemonkey85 It's the principle though. Why do I need a hardware device to activate a web service? I just want the email. pfmiller If the account is for when he's older, why would he need the phone to use now? codemonkey85 I just like to be prepared. 😜 Christopher Bement Maybe you missed the part where it's in beta. And made by Google so don't expect much. And your child is 2. Tomáš Petrík When he reaches the age when it actually makes sense to have a phone, there will be plenty of cheap second-hand devices with that old Nougat version. Simps Damn. U.S Only, Google makes me wait for everything lol Zach Mauch This sounds like the start of something I have been very much wanting for a while. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Sounds great, but now they need a way to grand amnesty to those of us who had to give up and lie to get our kids accounts so we could get them on devices before this was available and let us update and import those. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ i dont think kids under 13 need phones. maybe the likes of a jitterbug?? i'm like half kidding Adam Margeson Do I seem like an old fart if I say that I don't think that children should have cell phones/tablets and the like except for safety situations such as being at school before the doors open or after they close or walking to/from there. I don't care if they play on consoles or computers, but I don't like the idea of sticking a child in front of any screen for extended periods of time. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ i dont really disagree with it. other are going to scoff at this but oh well. i dont think my kids needs a phone with all these apps/games on them. at this age, they need to be able to make a phone call or receive a phone call. Thats it. Hank No, I would never lie about my kids age to create Google account. :-) My kid has a Samsung tablet that should get Nougat in the not too distant future. I assume this would work on a tablet and not just a phone. Would be nice if I could hook the existing Google account up to it and fix the age rather than creating a new ID and losing the apps and content he's already purchased using gift cards. Matt Williams Funny that the device has to be running Nougat, but the phone in the example is the Nexus 5, which ended at Marshmallow. Darnell If you go through the invite process and select "No" when at the point about Nougat, then they will tell you to continue if you want. Then they ask if you plan to get your kid a device that will work and select "No" again, they will let you continue, with notification when the app is generally available for Non-Nougat devices. So everyone interested, should get in on the invite process. And if you don't qualify today, they will let you know when you do. I've got kids still rocking 2013 Nexus 7s. andrey3000 "Only in America". Donald Trump has to love Google's America First Beta Philosophy! :( Adam Margeson Anyone else notice that Google is still using a Nexus 5 silhouette for their screenshots? Leeav Amar When available I will test this on my Nexus 7 2013. It is running Lineage OS 14.1 (based on Nougat 7.1.1). Carson Saldanha Can you set this up for your child without them needing a phone? Fiorta Needs nougat? Really? How many kids under 13 have devices that run nougat? Hell, most adults don't even have it at this point... JG and certainly no one would ever lie about their age on the internet. Right? You've apparently never ran into a block like Are you at least 18? Yes, let me in No, get me out of here Not saying that I ever did either... ::Whistles:: sodsavage I would like to see them pull in Android Device Manager capabilities so you can track the device from this app. Would be nice to even include a route/map and timeline of destinations for the past X amount of hours/days. David Yes, but is there a way to convert an existing Google Account INTO a Child's account? grazapin Yeah, I created accounts for my kids so they would have unique IDs for Hangouts on the tablets they used regularly. Now that we've been using those accounts for a while I don't want to create new ones in Family Link, but if I could convert them I probably would. movemint just got my invite and wondering the same thing. Basic search in Google help has yielded no answers. jdrch LMFAO. Nice way to catch up, Google. Microsoft has had Family and child account functionality across the board for aeons now. ecnjnr "Google has never allowed anyone under the age of 13 to have a Google account" Actually, that's not true. Certain Verizon devices back in the Gingerbread era let you create a Google account on the setup screen without entering your age or agreeing that you were 13. https://www.verizonwireless.com/support/knowledge-base-105462/ I, uh, may have taken advantage of this. Iamsecond US only, and Nougat only? Someone please remind Google they are a massive international company with a huge user base that mostly does not have Nougat. AQ Useful bits from the FAQ you could update/clarify in the post: "Can Family Link manage “regular” Google accounts? No. Family Link can only manage Google accounts for kids under 13. These accounts can only be created via Family Link." Devices: "Parents can run Family Link on Android devices running KitKat (4.4) and higher. Family Link is not available for parents on iOS at this time. Kids can run Family Link on Android devices running Nougat (7.0) and higher, along with the following Marshmallow (6.1) devices: Alcatel Dawn Alcatel Fierce 4 Alcatel Pixi Unite LG K3 LG Stylo 2 Plus LG X Power Samsung Galaxy Luna Samsung Galaxy Tab A Sony Xperia X Family Link is not available for kids on iOS at this time." Anthrox They really need to Support the Nexus 7 (2013) with this program LibbysH8Me I wish the play store for add a tab for purchased apps.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile.

He and a few other individuals across the globe have come together under the aegis of Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID) in Paris to demand "protection of private integrity and societal value" on the Internet. "Twenty of us from all over the world have come together and we want big companies like Facebook and Google to take responsibility for their content," Pitroda said while addressing a gathering of Pune International Centre members and others at the College of Engineering here. He said unlike newspapers, big companies like Google and Facebook do not take responsibility for their content. "If newspapers publish incorrect information, they will apologise. On the other hand, Google and Facebook won't even remove the content. So, this has been bothering us for quite some time," he said. Pitroda said that there is concern over a lot of misinformation, gossip and vendetta on social media. "By design, people propagate misinformation because it gets them more hits," the technology veteran added. The man, who also served as advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said some people hire publicists to tweet on their behalf. "There is a difference between propaganda and information," said the man who is credited with laying the telecommunication roadmap for the country in the 1980s. He stressed the need for a new design to the world order in the Internet age and said India - because of its value system, family bonds and social cohesion - is best suited to build that design. "World can only be redesigned by Indians but we are not ready to take on a task like this because our house is not in order. Today, the world is waiting for India to take the lead. People want family values, love, compassion -- all of which India has and also it has costumes, colour, food, diversity. No other country has that kind of diversity. To hold a country with so much diversity without guns is one of India's greatest accomplishments," he added.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english?

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 44 Share on Facebook 40 Share on Twitter Total Shares103 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 51 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares123 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile.

Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone.

Currently, though, there seems to be an issue with the service, rendering it useless to affected users. Thankfully, though, a temporary fix is available. The best gifts for Android users Update: Android Police has been able to trace the cause of this issue back to a server-side test, as well as confirming the same cause for a Google Play bug that removes all content from the main screen. Since this is a server-side test, not all phones or accounts will be affected, but users who are will likely have to sit tight until Google resolves things. According to several users on a growing Reddit thread, multiple users on Twitter, as well as both myself and my colleague Abner Li, Google Now has been having some issues for the past few days. For reasons unknown, the service refuses the cards that give it its functionality, instead simply showing the message “failed to load cards,” regardless of the network connection. For me, the issue has only been appearing on my Pixel XL (Android 7.1.2), not my Galaxy S8 or my Huawei Mate 9. Looking at user reports on Reddit, Pixel and Nexus devices seem to be the most affected, with some other miscellaneous devices, including the Galaxy S8, seeing the same issue. It also isn’t happening solely in the US, with reports coming from multiple regions around the globe including the UK. Thankfully, though, one Reddit user has a working fix for the problem. Simply clearing the Google app’s data seems to eliminate the issue. To do this, simply go into Settings > Application Manager > Google App > Manage Space > Clear Google Search Data. Once you’ve done that, your cards should start working again.

Name: Subject: Message: People are using more apps now than ever before Newsby Joe Hindy6 hours ago 3 201 16 The rhetoric regarding apps hasn’t changed much over the years. Every year, people are using more and more for longer periods of time. As it turns out, 2016 wasn’t much different. According to a report by App Annie, people spent nearly one trillion hours in apps in 2016. That trend is looking to continue into 2017. Let’s take a look at the latest numbers and dive more into the topic. Related Articles:   App Annie: For the first time, Android app spending will ...March 30, 2017 The first graph shows that people used apps 25% more often in Q1 2016 than the previous quarter. App Annie hypothesizes that it’s because the smartphone user base has grown so substantially. More phones are coming out in more places that didn’t previously have smartphones. Thus, the conclusion isn’t that people are using apps more often. Rather, there are simply more people using apps than there were before. The graph above doesn’t seem like it adds up to almost one trillion hours. However, keep in mind that this graph is just for Android phones. As it turns out, virtually all of us have apps that we don’t normally use. On average, we only use between 1/3 and 1/2 of the apps we have installed on any given month (based on region). There are a variety of reasons why this could be. Many devices have pre-installed apps that people simply never use. Additionally, apps like file managers, background downloaders, and other productivity types may see infrequent use. For instance, many people use Google Docs, but how many have downloaded Slides and Sheets and then only occasionally use them? App Annie mentions the importance of retention as a measurement of success. After all, the most successful apps are the ones people actually use. In every region they measured, App Annie was unable to find a demographic that doesn’t use at least nine different apps per day. Most had over ten apps used per day. That seems like a lot. However, if you take into account that virtually everything you do in a phone requires an app, the numbers add up quickly. The report notes that the app types used every day vary widely as well. Thus, it’s not just communication and social media, but also productivity, tools, utilities, shopping, entertainment, and others. The conclusion is that we aren’t just using a bunch of apps every day, but rather that we’re using a bunch of different types every day. Based on the graph above, people use four different tools and four communication apps per month. App Annie posits that this is likely because of pre-installed apps that people actually do use. Google Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS, etc. It’s also worth mentioning that Cortana and Google Assistant fall under the tools category and they count as well. Android users play more games than iOS users do. However, iOS users use a larger variety of social media platforms than Android users. The important thing to note for this, though, is how many different varieties of apps that people use every month. On average, people in the United States spend one month out of every year using an app of some sort. That averages out to about two hours and 15 minutes per day. In fact, the amount of time spent per day has increased every year since 2015. Really, there isn’t a lot of additional analysis here. It’s another graph that shows that people are spending more time using their phones. App Annie’s research concluded that most people spent over 80% of their time not in the top app in their country. The top app in any given country is usually Facebook or WhatsApp. App Annie states that this means that other app developers have plenty of time. However, we feel like there is more to it than that. For instance, a person may check Facebook many times a day for a minute at a time. On the other hand, Google Maps may only be opened once for ten minutes for the daily commute. We would love to see a “per session” metric as well to see how often and how long people spend in an app every time they visit for a more complete view of peoples daily activity. App Annie did provide a graph to show the number of sessions per day and time per session. Most of this makes a lot of sense. Transportation had fewer sessions per day but more time per session. Likewise, finance had more sessions per day, but less time per session. After all, it doesn’t take but a few moments to check your bank balance. Social media is curiously absent from the graph. We imagine that’s because people use them for more sessions per day than this graph is set up to handle. Dating is a surprising case with both high sessions per day and minutes per session. The final image deals with gaming. Like apps, gaming has been on the rise for a few years. South Korea and Japan have the most gaming growth by a long shot. We’ve known that games were on the rise for years. Especially since they draw in so much more revenue than apps do. None of it is really surprising, but it’s nice to see a graph of it. Check out the best Android apps, ever!   15 best Android apps of 20176 days ago The big takeaway here is that the apps and games market on mobile has taken hold. It’s not a commentary on how many apps get downloaded. After all, reports show that those numbers are going down in developed markets. What it does say is that the apps that people have chosen to use are ones they now use instead of previous methods in the past. We use apps to check our bank accounts, talk to people, navigate, and be productive more now than we did last year or the year before. For now, there is nothing to indicate that those trends are changing anytime soon.

Some were aware of deleting the email right away. Others, not so lucky. This prompted Google to warn users about a Google Docs phishing scam that may pop up in your inbox. This email invited the user to look at a Google Doc with a link that phished for the user’s personal information. Google handled the incident quickly. The tech giant also disabled features that were created to steal your personal information, reports USA Today. The incident made people aware that Google Docs is not as safe as it may look. It will also the change the way people will use and collaborate with the free word-processing tool. It’s also important for you to make sure that you’re using Google Docs the right away. The Google Docs phishing scam included an email saying that the user is invited to “edit the following document.” The recipient sees a form generated by a company that claims to be from Google. Some of the users weren’t sure if the email was legitimate or not. When you click on the link, the hackers will get access to your Google account and all the information you have stored. [Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images] Here are some smart ways to use Google Docs. Google offers the option to include a “shareable link” at the top. Use that option instead of generating the typical Google form email. Copy the link, compose your email, and send it to your friends, explaining what’s in the link and why they should open it. The Google Docs phishing scam included no context or note. It also didn’t even include the official blue Google Docs logo. Enable Google’s two-factor authentication. This will protect you from potential hackers. Signing in twice will make it harder for hackers to access your account. Google’s two-step process starts by signing in with your password. The second step involves receiving a text message code or authorizing via your Google app on your smartphone. Google also has an Authenticator app for signing in. Here are some additional Google Docs security tips from BetterCloud. You can limit sharing options in your Google Apps Control Panel. You also have options to set the link to private, with the domain, within the domain with a link, anyone with the link, and public on the web. [Image by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images] You also want to make sure that your Gmail settings are safe as well. Google Docs is a great way to collaborate with your colleagues and coworkers via email. But it can pose some safety issues, as you can see. You don’t want to risk having your Gmail account compromised. Make sure you have a strong password. If you don’t, you may want to change it now or after reading this article. You also want to check your Gmail settings to ensure no one else has access to your emails. In addition, updating your web browser and reporting scams, spam, and phishing will keep your account safe and secure. While signing into your Google accounts is easy and quick, it’s just as important to sign out of them as well. Be careful whenever you’re using a network you don’t know, and learn more about setting up your home router and WiFi network securely. Lock your smartphone screen or device before you leave the house. Always keep your devices clean with anti-virus software and malware. Be sure to use safety measures when shopping online, especially on Google Shopping. Don’t use the same password that you use on your Google accounts. And, make sure to sign out of your account when you’re done with your online shopping. These are just some of the ways that you can take control of your Google Docs, Gmail, and other Google accounts.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english?

It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme."

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google exec says those famous last words about Windows 10 S -7 by Surur  @mspoweruser May 6, 2017 at 23:21 GMT8 hours ago Windows 10 S is the first Google-free Windows PC.  The PC will not let users install Google Chrome, won’t let users change the default search engine to Google, and of course, does not have any Google Apps in the store (largely due to Google and not Microsoft.) Google is however pretty sanguine regarding Microsoft’s new OS, saying those famous last words which usually precedes being steam-rollered by the competition. “I’m happy to see a validation of the approach we’ve taken,” said Prabhakar Raghavan, the Google vice-president responsible for G Suite — Google’s range of productivity apps like Docs and Pages. “What educational institutions have demanded is simplicity. It’s a real test tube for all of us, whether it’s Microsoft or any of us, right.” According to the latest stats, Google has grabbed 58% market share in the US education market, largely due to the low cost and easy manageability of Chromebooks and the browser-based curriculum which is somewhat unique to the USA. Microsoft has however taken pains to make sure their Windows 10 S PCs were in the same price range as Chromebooks, and have even made sure the Edge browser is compatible with Google’s Education apps. The battle for the hearts and minds of students is important if Microsoft is to have any role in the computing lives of the next generation in 5 to 10 years. Noted Google’s Raghavan: “Because kids do things in amazing ways where you or I would never expect. So here’s one of the things we’ve learned in a study of kids as we were developing all our tools for classrooms, right. We would put a Chromebook in front of a kid, they would whip out their phone and write their essay. We said ‘no no no, there’s a keyboard there, you can use it,’ and they still write the essay there. They said ‘we’ll use the keyboard to touch up the formatting, but it’ll be much faster here,’ right. This is something we consistently learned when we looked at pre-teens … these kids are really forerunners, the vanguards of human evolution, in some sense, and so it’s great to see that some of the approaches we’ve taken, but I think the world is going to keep evolving and it’s a scramble for us to keep up with what people are going to do.” With no mobile platform to speak of the success of Windows 10 S in schools is even more important for Microsoft. “The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants,” Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of education tech company Clever, told Reuters. “There’s so much investment into the space — it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.” Whether Microsoft has what it takes to convince educators to take up their platform remains to be seen, but it is probably a bad idea to bet against Microsoft in the semi-corporate environment of the education industry.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 104 Share on Twitter Total Shares577 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives.

John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 103 Plus 1 on G+ 370 Share on Facebook 104 Share on Twitter Total Shares577 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

Avoid adding to the problem by setting your mobile up for safe operation when you're on the road — here are some basic tips. Image: Google Setting up an iPhone If you're an iPhone user, Siri is your best friend as a driver. It lets you tell your phone what you need instead of having to peck at the screen with your fingers and take your eyes off the road while you're doing it. To get "hey Siri" to work at any time in any app on iOS devices, open Settings then tap Siri and toggle the Allow "Hey Siri" switch to on. On anything older than an iPhone 6s, the phone has to be plugged into a power supply before the voice shortcut is going to work, so you might need a car charger. Siri can come in handy in all kinds of ways while you're driving: "hey Siri, read out my messages" for example. You can make calls, send messages, get navigation directions and more besides — ask Siri "what can you do?" to see a full list (while you're parked). You should also think about whether you really need alerts to be on while you're driving. Before you set off, swipe up on the home screen to bring up the Control Center, and you can enable either aeroplane mode (no incoming alerts at all) or the Do Not Disturb mode (muted alerts). Head to the Do Not Disturb section in the iOS Settings app and you can allow calls from certain contacts to break through this wall of silence. There are a select number of third-party apps that can make your drive safer too. LifeSaver, for example, locks up the display while you're on the move and rewards you for resisting the temptation to tamper with it, and SafeDrive takes a similar gamified approach. Another option is AT&T DriveMode, which can limit outside communications, gives you one-touch access to key apps, and can even reply to your incoming texts for you. Setting up an Android phone The big tip for drivers using Google-powered handsets is to get Android Auto installed. The app is now available for any Android 5.0+ phone, no head unit required, and brings with it oversized widgets, simplified icons, a streamlined interface and a focus on voice control for all of the key interactions you need. There are smart touches throughout, like the option to send an "I'm driving at the moment" text reply at the push of a button, and support for launching the Android Auto interface automatically when certain Bluetooth devices (like your car stereo) are detected. It makes Android even more pro-active too, automatically showing navigation buttons for places you've recently looked up on Google Maps, while music and podcast apps (including Spotify and Google Play Music) get stripped-down, chunky interfaces as well. There are other tweaks you can apply, with or without Android Auto. For example, you can enable the "OK Google" voice command so it works at any time in any app. Choose Settings, Voice and then "OK Google" detection from the menu inside the Google app. Commands you can try while you're driving cover everything from "call Mum" to "directions to 1414 Colusa Avenue, Indooroopilly, Queensland". As on the iPhone, Android includes aeroplane mode and a Do Not Disturb function (under Sound in Settings), so you can choose to mute your handset or switch off connectivity altogether — remember that Google Maps can cache directions and maps in advance, so you can still find your way somewhere. Finally, there are third-party apps you can consider installing too. Drive Safe can respond to texts automatically, while SafeDrive blocks all of your phone's alerts until your speed drops back down under 16km-an-hour. Drivemode, like Android Auto, is based around a simplified, "no look" interface that you can operate using your voice or some basic on-screen swipes, and then there's OneTap, which aims to be a smart, personal driving assistant. Not only can it launch itself automatically when you start driving, it also logs all the notifications it's suppressed on your behalf, and can be configured to let alerts through from 'emergency' contacts.

Weather Your 4-day local weather forecast Sunday May 7, 2017 Life & Style Technology Larger / SmallerNight Mode VR app lets you see through the eyes of person with dementia Tim Biggs 22 Sep 2016, 2:35 p.m. A new virtual reality app that puts users in the position of a person living with dementia has been released for Google's Cardboard VR platform. VR app lets you see through the eyes of person with dementia Carers trying out EDIE at the Alzheimer's Australia launch event in Melbourne. Photo: Arsineh Houspian A screenshot from the EDIE VR app. Dr Ron Petersen from the Mayo Clinic in the US tries out the EDIE app at the launch event. Photo: Arsineh Houspian Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit A new virtual reality app that puts users in the position of a person living with dementia has been released for Google's Cardboard VR platform. Called EDIE (pronounced Eddy put standing for Educational Dementia Immersive Experience), the app was launched on Thursday by Alzheimer's Australia Vic, and is available free on Android and iPhone. Dr Tanya Petrovich, manager of business development at Alzheimer's Australia Vic, says the app was designed to build empathy and make people more aware of the issues faced by those living with Dementia. "The idea is you step into the shoes of a person named Edie, who's living at home with his wife, and who is living with dementia", Petrovich says. When Edie gets up in the middle of the night and has to go to the bathroom, players see the world through his eyes. Petrovich says that many people think of Alzheimer's as only affecting the memory, but that it actually has a much broader range of symptoms. With EDIE, the user will get an approximation of the changes in sensory perception that may be experienced by a person living with dementia. "Perception is a really big issue", Petrovich says. "For you and me a pattern is easy to distinguish, but for a person living with dementia a pattern can appear to be moving, or it could even appear to be an animal. It could appear to be cockroaches or ants". It might even appear that a larger animal or person is in the room, when in reality it's just a pattern on the wall, Petrovich said. She added that while this is known to happen to some people living with dementia, every person is different and symptoms vary. In addition to memory, dementia can affect mood, language, problem solving and the ability to plan, although a virtual reality platform presents an ideal way to explain its effect on perception. Petrovich says the free app is an example of the kind of tool Alzheimer's Australia uses when training carers. Later this year, a workshop called Enabling Edie will use the app as a training tool. Carers will experience the same scene featured in the public version but with a second scene that shows how, after his carer makes a few changes, the environment could become more supportive for Edie. EDIE can be used with any VR viewer compatible with Cardboard. A number of low-cost viewers can be purchased through Google, and Alzheimer's Australia Vic is selling its own EDIE branded viewer for $15. September is Dementia Awareness Month. Help and more information can be found at fightdementia.org.au/vic or by calling the National Dementia Helpline on 1800 100 500. Home carers and health professionals interested in signing up for the EDIE workshop can do so at vic.fightdementia.org.au/edie.

The majority of people don't venture past the first page of results and if a website is on the second page, it only receives 4.8 percent of search traffic. Having a well-developed and properly optimized business website is more important today for businesses that want to be found than it has ever been in the past. In an effort to help businesses that have lackluster search results, The Deep End Web Consulting is looking for participants for a new YouTube series "My Website Sucks." The series will focus on business owners who want free advice and help for their website. Those who volunteer will be featured on this 10 episode web series. "The new series we are creating will consist of ten individual episodes, with our expert team evaluating the current site a business uses," stated company representative Wes McDowell. "Once the current site has been assessed, we will provide quick and actionable advice related to how to improve the site and start making their business more money." Without a great ranking on the first page of Google SERPs, businesses can't expect to compete in today's market. Google has 64 percent of the market share for desktop users, with Microsoft coming in second at 21 percent and Yahoo at just 12.5 percent.

But What Can It Actually Do? Berkshire Hathaway 2017 Warren Buffett: Not Buying Google Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Biggest Mistake Jen Wieczner May 06, 2017 At the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting Saturday, CEO Warren Buffett made a startling admission. After surprising investors recently with his giant bet on Apple stock, the Oracle of Omaha—long averse to Silicon Valley companies—says he now wishes he'd bought more technology stocks when he had the chance. Apple (aapl) has been Buffett's greatest hit over the past year, boosting Berkshire's portfolio by about $2 billion in 2017 alone after the investor loaded up on more of the iPhone maker's stock. Now, Buffett is kicking himself for not taking advantage of the opportunity to buy stock in Google (googl) shortly after it went public more than a dozen years ago. The founders of the company now called Alphabet even came to see Buffett shortly after the tech company's IPO with an investment prospectus, but the legendary stock-picker passed. "I knew the guys," Buffett said at the Berkshire Hathaway (brk.a) meeting. "And so I had plenty of ways to ask questions or anything of the sort and educate myself, but I blew it." Buffett's business partner and Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman Charlie Munger regrets that decision even more. "If you asked me in retrospect what was our worst mistake in the tech field," that was it, Munger said at the meeting. "I think we were smart enough to figure out Google—those ads worked so much better in the early days than anything else—so I would say that we failed you there," Munger said. "We were smart enough to do it, and we didn’t do it." In fact, Berkshire's insurance subsidiary Geico was an early customer of Google, buying ads on the search engine for "$10 to $11 a click," so the investors had a front row seat seat to the business' growth, Buffett said. "Any time you're paying somebody $10 or $11 when somebody just punches a little thing where you’ve got no cost at all, that’s a good business," he added. "You’ve almost never seen a business like it."

But Buffett also noted a fundamental change in the market that has made him see tech differently, observing that the five most valuable American companies are now worth a whopping more than $2.5 trillion combined. Those five companies, in order of market value, are Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft (msft), Amazon (amzn) and Facebook (fb). "And if you take those five companies, essentially you could run them with no equity capital at all," Buffett said. "You literally don’t need any money to run the five companies that are collectively worth more than $2.5 trillion." "That is a different world than what existed in the past," he added, comparing the "capital-light" nature of Internet and cloud computing companies to the capital-intensive industrial and steel businesses that he invested in earlier in his career. "But this is so much better if you happen to be good at it." Given his views on the compelling case for those companies, a shareholder asked Buffett during the annual meeting's Q&A why Berkshire had never invested in Amazon. "I was too dumb to realize what was going to happen," Buffett responded, saying he "never even considered" buying Amazon stock, despite his great respect for the e-commerce company's founder, Jeff Bezos. "I admired Jeff but I did not think he’d succeed on the scale that he has," Buffett said, noting that Amazon's lucrative foray into the cloud services business never occurred to him a few years ago. "I really underestimated the brilliance of the execution." But for Berkshire's executives, the one that got away, so to speak, is really Alphabet. "I don’t feel any regret about missing out on the achievements of Amazon," Munger said. "Other things were easy, and I think we screwed up a little." When Buffett declined to comment on those screw-ups, Munger clarified: "I meant Google." In the future, though, Berkshire is likely to make more bets on tech, Munger hinted. "I think it’s a very good sign that you bought the Apple stock," Munger told Buffett. "It shows either one of two things: Either you’ve gone crazy or you're learning. I prefer the learning explanation." Customer ServiceSite MapPrivacy PolicyAdvertisingAd ChoicesTerms of UseYour California Privacy RightsCareers © 2017 Time Inc. All rights reserved.

Here’s all the vital info you need By Rob Waugh Event for The Mail on Sunday Published: 17:06 EDT, 6 May 2017 | Updated: 17:06 EDT, 6 May 2017 e-mail View comments Like eBooks, streaming music services are difficult to really love. There’s no equivalent to that delicious crackle of cellophane as you unwrap a gatefold, special-edition vinyl double disc. But, also like eBooks, I use streaming services because I’m a dyed-in-the-wool skinflint.  With streaming – playing music over the internet instead of buying a hard copy – there is no danger of building up a really splendid music collection only to find the format is declared ‘dead’, and no one makes the players any more. Yes, I’ll admit I am still pretty bitter about my extensive MiniDisc collection. But streaming isn’t going to disappear any time soon.  You can listen to Taylor Swift on Apple Music and Amazon Music (although not Spotify, due to people being able to use it free) The Rolling Stones (left) and Rihanna (right) Katy Perry (left) and Neil Young (right)  Beyonce in concert for the 'Formation: World Tour' at Qualcomm Stadium, San Diego Ed Sheeran is a popular artist for millions of streaming app users  The music industry saw a five per cent rise in profits in 2016, after years of shattering losses – and the rise has been driven by people streaming music. There are now 100 million paying users worldwide.  If you’re using a smartphone to listen to music, streaming apps are by far the easiest way to get music on your phone – and allow you to load up as many albums as you want without having to painstakingly transfer files from a PC.  Most artists who initially refused to stream their music – such as Bob Dylan – have now caved in, and you can even listen to Taylor Swift on Apple Music and Amazon Music (although not Spotify, due to people being able to use it free).  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next 'Ingeniously plotted and immaculately performed': The... Neeme Järvi and his Estonian National Symphony Orchestra... Share this article Share New family plans mean you can have up to six users on one account – so you no longer need to suffer the indignity of being kicked off your music when your children want to listen to Katy Perry. But how do you choose a streaming service?  At first glance they all seem identical, with millions of tracks that can be played either via your PC, mobile phone or tablet.  Even the pricing is similar, with free services offering music with occasional adverts in between the tracks, and paid-for subscriptions offering the chance to stream higher-quality tracks, with no ads, and download them to your device for listening offline. But there are crucial differences, with some streaming CD-quality music – and some not.  They also differ in how easy it is to find new music. Some recommend music based on your tastes – and even where you are, with Google’s Play offering playlists for ‘work’ and ‘home’. So which is best for you?   APPLE MUSIC  Price £9.99 per month (£14.99 for family of six)  Maximum sound quality 256kbps  Songs 40 million  Free version No  Best feature Great if you have lots of iTunes tracks Downside Not so great for non Apple users.   Apple’s service has evolved into a sophisticated, high-gloss app that, typically of Apple, is slickly designed and intuitive to use.  If you’ve got a sizeable collection of music bought from iTunes over the years, it’s great, as you can access those files from anywhere, as well as the 40 million tracks offered by Apple Music – and Apple uses your music tastes to recommend other songs you might like.  The software on desktop PCs is a little ugly, but it works well on iPhone (and even Android). GOOGLE PLAY MUSIC  Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six)  Maximum sound quality 320kbps  Songs 40 million  Free version No  Best feature Upload your own tracks Downside Big Brotherstyle snooping.   Google’s service is a polished juggernaut, topped up with slightly spooky features, such as ‘knowing’ when you’re at home, and recommending music to unwind to (it does this using your phone’s sensors and Google’s alarming store of data).  The colourful app is easy to use – and you can upload 50,000 of your own tracks to listen to anywhere. Just like in Google Search, there’s an ‘I’m Feeling Lucky’ button, which brings up a radio station based on your music taste .  SPOTIFY Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six) Maximum sound quality 320kbps Songs 30 million Free version Yes, with adverts Best feature Lots of ways to find new music Downside Fewer tracks than its rivals.     Spotify has been going for nine years, making it the grandfather of streaming music. It feels extremely polished and excels at recommending you new music, with daily updated playlists based on your previous listening, divided by genres you like.  If you’re on a family plan, each member gets their own daily mix. Initially, it’s irritating having a computer ‘DJ’ your music – but the system works well and you swiftly fall into listening to them.  DEEZER  Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six) Maximum sound quality 1,411 kbps (with Deezer Elite for Sonos users) Songs 43 million Free version Yes, with adverts Best feature Works well with Sonos hi-fis Downside Clunkier than Spotify.   Deezer does it all – with a freebie version, and also hi-fi-friendly hi-res files, although the catch is that you’ll need to own a Sonos sound system to take advantage of the high-quality ‘Deezer Elite’ service, as well as paying £14.99 a month for the privilege. Another cute extra is live sports commentary – including Premiership games – delivered via TalkSport. TIDAL Price £9.99 (£19.99 for Tidal Hi-Fi) Maximum sound quality 1,411 kbps Songs 47 million Free version No Best feature CD-quality sound Downside The top-end version is very expensive.   Tidal was relaunched with ridiculous fanfare by Jay-Z and a small army of his celebrity friends – but it’s actually less awful than that makes it sound. The big sell here is high-quality sound – CD-quality, or even above, with some albums available at similar sound quality to the ‘master’ recordings used in studios.  There’s also a pleasing emphasis on playlists created by humans – with compilations curated by musicians.   AMAZON MUSIC  Price £9.99 (£14.99 for family of six) Maximum sound quality 256kbps Songs 40 million Free version No Best feature Great with Echo Downside Fewer good recommendations.   Amazon’s music service is a great option if you’ve already climbed on board with Amazon Prime – or you own an Echo smart speaker. It’s £9.99 a month, £7.99 for Prime users, and £3.99 for Echo users.  Sound quality is great, and it works with voice control. It’s less clever at recommending music than Spotify and Google Play Music, though.         Share or comment on this article e-mail Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing.

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting.

Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US."

He and a few other individuals across the globe have come together under the aegis of Association for Accountability and Internet Democracy (AAID) in Paris to demand "protection of private integrity and societal value" on the Internet. "Twenty of us from all over the world have come together and we want big companies like Facebook and Google to take responsibility for their content," Pitroda said while addressing a gathering of Pune International Centre members and others at the College of Engineering here. He said unlike newspapers, big companies like Google and Facebook do not take responsibility for their content. "If newspapers publish incorrect information, they will apologise. On the other hand, Google and Facebook won't even remove the content. So, this has been bothering us for quite some time," he said. Pitroda said that there is concern over a lot of misinformation, gossip and vendetta on social media. "By design, people propagate misinformation because it gets them more hits," the technology veteran added. The man, who also served as advisor to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said some people hire publicists to tweet on their behalf. "There is a difference between propaganda and information," said the man who is credited with laying the telecommunication roadmap for the country in the 1980s. He stressed the need for a new design to the world order in the Internet age and said India - because of its value system, family bonds and social cohesion - is best suited to build that design. "World can only be redesigned by Indians but we are not ready to take on a task like this because our house is not in order. Today, the world is waiting for India to take the lead. People want family values, love, compassion -- all of which India has and also it has costumes, colour, food, diversity. No other country has that kind of diversity. To hold a country with so much diversity without guns is one of India's greatest accomplishments," he added.

Some folks don't have the entire Apple ecosystem. iPad is arguably one of the most popular tablets around (if not the most popular), but many iPad users don't use iPhone — they're on Android, and that's OK. I run Android, but I use an iPad for mobile gaming and reading digital comics. Syncing between the two platforms isn't inherent, but you can sync Reminders and lists with certain apps. That way the whole family can stay on the same page, no matter which operating system each person prefers. How to sync reminders and calendars between iPad and Android How to add events and reminders to Google Calendar for iPhone and iPad How to sync reminders and calendars between iPad and Android Use the Google Calendar app. It's absolutely the best way to sync reminders and calendars across both platforms. When you use Google Assistant on your Android phone, the reminder is automatically added to the Reminders calendar in Google Calendar. Even if you don't have Assistant, using Google Calendar for reminders is the perfect way to see all of your to-dos, whether they be simple, menial things or upcoming events. Download the Google Calendar app for iOS, sign in with your Google account, and boom – reminders and events are automatically synced. The unfortunate aspect of this process is the lack of support for Siri if you're going the other way. If you have an Android tablet and want to sync reminders from iPhone, you won't be able to sync your reminders from the Reminders app. You could sync over your Calendar app events by subscribing to your calendar's URL in Google Calendar, but that's not always best, since events can take up to 24 hours to show up in your Google Calendar. Apple does let you sync Reminders with other accounts, but your options are pretty much everything but Google (who'da thunk?!). If you want to sync reminders and calendars between iOS and Android, just use the Google Calendar app for everything. All you have to do is sign in and it's all there. You may have to mess with your sync settings, but that's about it. That's the price we pay for walking in both worlds. C'est la vie. There are other Android apps that help with syncing, but many are quite hit and miss and some of the more popular ones, like SmoothSync, haven't been updated in years. How to add events and reminders to Google Calendar How to add events and reminders to Google Calendar for iPhone and iPad Adding events and reminders to Google Calendar is pretty much the same as adding them to any other calendar app. Launch Google Calendar from your Home screen. Tap the switch next to an account if you already use Google accounts on your iPhone or iPad. Otherwise, tap Add a Google account and sign in. Tap Get Started. Google Calendar will load all existing events for that account. Tap the add button in the bottom right corner of your screen. It's the red + button. Tap Reminder or Event. Tap the green area below the X to enter a title and tap Done. Tap the date to scroll and change it. You can set the time as well or tap the switch to make it an all-day event. You can then add a location to your event or reminder, as well as notifications, and you can change its color, and add notes and attachments. Need something more intensive? If you think you need something a little more robust than Google Calendar, then you might want to check out some third-party apps, like: Evernote — Free, w/ IAPs — iOS, Android Microsoft OneNote — Free — iOS, Android Questions?

The VAIO Phone A handset uses the same hardware platform as the company’s VAIO Phone Biz launched last year, but uses Google's more popular operating system. VAIO is selling the Cortex-A53 based mid-range phone for less than $250, which is very low for a phone made of machined aluminum. VAIO, the former PC division of Sony and now an independent PC vendor from Japan, entered the smartphone market with its VAIO Phone Biz handset about a year ago targeting primarily business users. Since VAIO’s PCs run Windows 10, it was logical for the company to launch a Windows 10 Mobile-based handset supporting the Continuum technology and all the features that Microsoft’s platform has to offer. Apart from the OS, the key selling point of the VAIO Phone Biz was its aluminum unibody, which promised to be very durable. VAIO has never commented on just how well the Phone Biz has sold over its lifetime, but a year after the release of the product VAIO is re-launching it with Google Android. Just like VAIO’s first smartphone, the Phone A (VPA 0511 S) is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 system-on-chip (eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.50 GHz, Adreno 405 graphics core) and features a 5.5” FHD display. The handset comes equipped with 3 GB of LPDDR3 memory, 16 GB of NAND flash storage (and a microSD card slot for expansion), 13 MP rear and 5 MP front cameras, 802.11a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, a micro USB 2.0 connector, various sensors, a 2800 mAh battery, and so on. Just like its Windows 10-based brother, the new unit also supports two SIM cards (a nano SIM and a micro SIM) and is compatible with 3G/LTE bands 1, 3, 6, 8, 11, 19 and 21 with carrier aggregation (so, not suitable for the U.S.). Finally, the weight and thickness of the product remained the same as before: 8.3 mm and 167 grams. Despite the fact that the Snapdragon 617 is supported by Android 7, VAIO ships its Phone A with vanilla Android 6.0. It is unknown whether the company plans to update the OS eventually, but right now, the handset looks a bit outdated in terms of both hardware and software. Computers and phones supplied by VAIO are developed by the company’s engineers and are made by various contract manufacturers. Meanwhile, the final quality checks and assembly of the hardware is performed at the Nagano Technology Site (Azumino City, Nagano Prefecture), the former hub of Sony’s PC operations. Due to that and materials used, VAIO has a reason to claim that its products feature a higher quality than competing offerings from its rivals, which is especially true when it comes to inexpensive Android handsets. The VAIO Phone A is now available from the company’s online store exclusively in Japan; though like the Phone Biz, this phone is likely to show make its way to foreign third-party retailers as well. The company charges ¥26,784 ($237) per unit, which is uncommonly cheap for a smartphone featuring a durable, machined aluminum unibody, even taking the hardware and software into consideration. On the other hand, given the cutthroat competition on the Android market, a low price point is a way to drive sales. Sources: VAIO, K-Tai Watch.

POST A COMMENT 11 Comments View All Comments Death666Angel - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link Cortex A53 smartphones are becoming quite boring. Reply vladx - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link Well it's a low-end phone and I guess VAIO bets on its name selling well, otherwise there are better devices at this price point. Reply Lehti - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link This actually looks rather nice. I have to admit I came in thinking "Oh, awesome, they're trying to squeeze every bit of sales they can out of Sony's former brand", but at that price, it's hard to fault this phone. Reply Marlin1975 - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link $237 for a 617 based phone, that's to much. You can get a Moto G4 with a 617 for less. Or the Moto G5 Plus with the 625 for about the same price. Reply SquarePeg - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link The Moto G4 Plus is $174.99 at Best Buy and the G5 Plus is $229 everywhere. I put zero value on a metal shell on a budget smartphone. The money would have been better spent on upgrading to the SD 625. Reply sonicmerlin - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link Buying a phone with only Cortex A53 is basically dooming yourself to 2013 smartphone performance. Reply Diji1 - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link Yes, you'll be doomed as you run all your apps at the same speed as 2013 provided you don't play games. Completely and utterly doomed. Reply Glock24 - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link The SD617 is already old, and if I remember correctly, we prone to overheating. Besides that the design of the phone is boring, and for that price there are better alternatives. On a side note, I did not know Vaio was no longer a Sony brand. Never liked their laptops though. Reply eek2121 - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link The US cell phone market is in a very sad state of affairs. I wish we could see both high and mid-range offerings that work with all US carriers and don't have a ton of bloatware installed. Just stock android, a decent price (I don't mind paying $600-$800 for a device I'll use daily for the next 2-3 years), and decent specs. Right now you can't really find decent offerings in the US that work on all carriers. Just cheap pieces of crap that have bad cameras, abysmal displays, etc. Reply nwrigley - Saturday, May 06, 2017 - link Agreed. Really missing the Nexus branded phones for offering good phones at targeted price points with stock android. I don't feel like we're asking for too much.

Photo: Supplied Tweet Facebook of ╳ exit He was a highly paid tech whiz whose lanky frame earned him the nickname Stretch. But Adam Dowidar, a bright Randwick Boys High graduate who made $160,000 a year working on Google Maps, was leading a secret life. He was also a member of the now-defunct Sydney gang Brothers for Life and he lied to police to frustrate their investigation into a brazen daylight shooting. On Friday, District Court Judge Helen Syme sentenced the 28-year-old to a maximum of three years and six months in prison for a range of offences, including making a false statement to police to hinder the discovery of evidence. He was also sentenced for possessing a silver replica gun – a cigarette lighter that could not be fired – and a Taser-style "electronic prod-like device". Dowidar, dressed neatly in jeans and a navy jumper with his dark hair slicked back, waved to his older brother and grinned broadly as he was led from the dock in the Downing Centre District Court. His jail sentence was backdated to September last year and he will be eligible for parole in two years and one month, in October 2018. The court found Dowidar lent his luxury white Lexus to another man to drive the de facto leader of Brothers For Life, Mohammed Hamzy, to the Greenacre street where gang member Yehya Amoud was shot dead in October 2012. Judge Syme said Dowidar was at Hamzy's house on the day of the shooting but "declined to drive the car himself", possibly because he had already been caught driving while disqualified. Dowidar told police shortly after the shooting that his four-wheel-drive "wasn't being driven" on the day and it was "home all day". "This was clearly false and he knew it to be false," Judge Syme said. Months later, Dowidar reported the Lexus stolen and it was found burnt out. A witness told Dowidar's judge-alone trial the 4WD had to be destroyed as the gang was "concerned about it being bugged" by police after it was seized for forensic examination, Judge Syme said. In a scathing assessment, Judge Syme said Dowidar continued to "avoid responsibility" for his crimes and had "little respect" for the court or his own family. His "misguided loyalty to a violent person such as Mr Hamzy is not in his own or the community's best interests", she said. His lack of remorse or "acceptance of even the slightest responsibility" was "immature and self-defeating" and meant his prospects of rehabilitation in prison were "only hopeful". He had "not been offence-free" since the crimes and was caught driving while disqualified again in 2015. Judge Syme said while the replica pistol could not be fired it was "a good imitation, according to evidence before the court" and could be used to threaten people. She said corrective services should try to ensure Dowidar was "not housed with other Brothers for Life members" in jail. A jury found Hamzy guilty of manslaughter last year over the death of Mr Amoud. Judge Syme said there was "no sensible explanation" for Dowidar attending Hamzy's trial when he had been ordered not to associate with Brothers for Life members. Dowidar had already been sentenced for drug possession and driving while disqualified at the time of the shooting. Judge Syme said Dowidar had been "extended considerable leniency by the courts" in the past but had not taken advantage of it and was "not entitled to any leniency for this offence". At the time of his arrest in November 2013, Dowidar's solicitor cast his client as a boy from a middle-class Belmore home, with a clean criminal record save for a few driving offences. He had worked for Google through a contractor for five years, during which time the tech giant regularly topped the list of best places to work and had become known for its beanbag-filled meeting rooms, ping-pong tables and free cafeteria. His contract ended in May 2013. Judge Syme said his employment was "terminated at about the time his criminal offending escalated dramatically". At Dowidar's bail hearing following his November 2013 arrest, Magistrate Elaine Truscott remarked he appeared to be "living a double life". Dowidar was one of 10 senior Brothers For Life members arrested during simultaneous raids across Sydney aimed at breaking up the group and ending a spate of shootings across the city. Picked up with Dowidar was Hamzy, the leader of the group's Bankstown chapter, who was also known as also known as "Little Crazy" of "LC". Throughout Hamzy's three-week trial the jury gained a small insight into the world of the now-defunct but once incredibly violent Brothers for Life gang. The street gang operated outside the law, bound by loyalties to each other. But when the long-time friends fell out, or rivalries arose, there were ways to take the law into their own hands. Hamzy was sentenced last October to 11 and a half years behind bars with a non-parole period of eight and a half years. with Ava Benny-Morrison and Nick Ralston WHO WERE BROTHERS FOR LIFE The violent street gang "Brothers for Life" first came to the attention of the NSW police in 2008, when convicted murderer Bassam Hamzy was caught running a sophisticated drug supply network while in Lithgow jail. Hamzy, who had been in custody since March 1999 for a series of crimes including drug supply, murder and conspiracy to murder, was able to make 19,523 calls using a mobile phone hidden in his cell to direct the drug deals between Sydney and Melbourne. It was during this time that the BFL "banner" as police called it, began to appear. Most of those who associated themselves with it were direct relatives of Hamzy and police believe the name was intended as a "show of support" and "loyalty" to their imprisoned "brother". A violent, internal feud within the gang erupted in 2013 resulting in a string of tit-for-tat shootings between the group's Blacktown and Bankstown chapters. The head of Blacktown chapter was Farhad Qaumi, nicknamed "The Afghan", was appointed as the BFL's "general" in 2012 by Bassam Hamzy. Hamzy's cousin, Mohammed Hamzy who was known as Little Crazy or LC was the head of the Bankstown Chapter. The internal war resulted in two killings, 11 shootings, two knee-cappings and several bashings. Police moved in, laying more than 300 charges against 21 members and in November 2014 senior officers declared that Brothers For Life had been dismantled. Clarification: an earlier version of this story described Dowidar as a Google employee. He was in fact contracted to the software giant through a third party. The story Google to gangster: Adam Dowidar jailed over involvement in Brothers for Life killing first appeared on The Sydney Morning Herald.

Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating.

The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd.

Warren Buffett admits he missed the boat on investing in two of today's most successful tech companies: Google and Amazon. Both are among the largest companies in the world today. Buffett said he should have known early on that Google was going places. He remembered that Berkshire subsidiary Geico was paying $10 or $11 to Google every time someone clicked on an ad. He admitted to being amazed that the business was able to make additional money with no incremental cost. But he still didn't buy the stock. "I blew it," he lamented, while speaking to tens of thousands of shareholders who had congregated in Omaha for Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder on Saturday. Buffett admitted he had the intel to understand Google's potential for growth early on. Along with Berkshire vice chairman Charlie Munger, Buffett roundly praised Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. Munger called him "a different species." "We missed it entirely. We never owned a share of Amazon," Buffett said. Berkshire's two major tech holdings are Apple and IBM. Earlier this week, Buffett announced that Berkshire Hathaway had dumped about a third of its IBM stock. It's the company's largest shareholder. "I thought it would do much better," Buffett admitted on Saturday. But he held that Apple and IBM are two very different companies, with Apple maintaining a focus on consumer products. Apple, which Buffett scooped up last year, accounts for about 5.5% of Berkshire's portfolio. -- CNN's Poppy Harlow contributed reporting. TM & © 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

SECTIONS Home Market Companies Economy Tech Auto Mutual Funds Stocks Currency Opinions Todays Paper E-Paper Horoscope Photos Video Photo Story Home Industry Berkshire Hathaway AGM: Warren Buffett says one of his biggest mistake was not investing in Google Berkshire Hathaway AGM: Warren Buffett says one of his biggest mistake was not investing in Google Buffett has often said he avoided buying stocks of technology companies in the past because he didn't really understand how they were making money and whether they would be able to do so over the long term. By: FE Online | Updated: May 6, 2017 11:18 PM “Our biggest tech failure was missing Google. Walmart and Google were missed opportunities,” Warren Buffet said. (Image: Reuters) Warren Buffett, referred to as the “Oracle of Omaha”, has admitted that he made a mistake by not buying Google shares years ago when the technology company was earning $10 to $11 per advertising click from Geico, a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway’s consumer insurance company. Buffett made the admission in today’s annual shareholders’ meeting of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in Omaha, Nebraska. “Our biggest tech failure was missing Google. Walmart and Google were missed opportunities,” he said. Buffett has often said he avoided buying stocks of technology companies in the past because he did not really understand how they were making money and whether they would be able to do so over the long term. In the case of Google, however, Buffett said he could have figured out the company had a great advertising business because he was, in effect, contributing to its profits. In recent years, Buffett has ventured a bit into investing in technology companies with mixed results. You may also like to watch: On Thursday, Buffett had said that he sold about one-third of Berkshire Hathaway’s stake in IBM Corp. The IBM stock had touched $180 on 14 February 2017 and had reached a high of $182.78 during the intra-day trading on 16 February 2017. On Thursday, the stock closed at $159.05 on the New York Stock Exchange. Buffett owned about 81 million shares of IBM Corp. at the end of 2016 and sold about a third of them in the first and second quarters of 2017, CNBC reported. Berkshire also holds about 133 million shares of Apple Inc., but Buffett says he looks at Apple more as a consumer products company instead of a technology company. “We do view Apple and IBM differently, Apple more of consumer business, IBM has more to do with products. We got it wrong on IBM and will find out whether we are wrong on Apple,” Buffett said. No Comments.

Enough is enough. This week’s giant Google Docs phishing attack, which led to the compromise of millions of Gmail accounts, is a wake-up call that we need a solution to the hacking epidemic. And I think I have one. First, though, let’s recap what happened: A canny hacker sent an email saying a contact wanted them to view a Google Docs document. People who clicked on a “Open in Docs” link were then asked for access to their account. The whole thing looked pretty convincing, and a lot of people fell for it (ThreatPost has a full breakdown of all the details). And while Google quickly took steps to mitigate the attack, the hackers were able to access a large number of accounts. In the wake of this, it’s tempting to do one of two things: blame Google for allowing this to happen, or shake your head at those poor fools who didn’t know any better and clicked the link. Both responses are reasonable. As SwiftonSecurity notes, an oversight by Google helped the hacker make the scam look convincing. But at the same time, the attack was suspicious enough that those with a passing knowledge of phishing and computer security knew enough to stay away. But such finger pointing won’t do anything to avoid the next big phishing attack, which will no doubt be zipping around the Internet before long. Instead, the solution I propose is a life-skills style education campaign aimed at high school students, and then at everyone else. I asked my partner, who is an educator in a New York City school, if such a thing exists. To my surprise, she said no. Instead, computer education is aimed at those who already have a passion for computers (and would be the least likely to fall for a phishing scheme.) There is no computer safety course for the general student population. Nor, as far as I know, is there such a thing for colleges or entry level jobs. And this is my point. Just as schools help young people to read maps or make a budget or cook or sew, it’s time for them to explain the Internet’s architecture and where the dangers lie. A decade ago, it was enough to warn kids about creeps on Craigslist. These days, the threats are infinitely more subtle, and the time has come to train kids to avoid them. Hacking is now a public safety issue. We should respond accordingly. PS Good news: After publishing this, several people reached out to say there are some programs out there — including this one at Fordham University—which aims to teach middle school kids about online safety and privacy.

Berkeley last summer after a 40-year academic career in computer architecture. He's now a key part of the team behind a critical chip that Google uses for artificial intelligence processing. Without this chip, Google top execs estimated it would have had to double its data centers to support even a limited amount of voice processing. Ari Levy | @levynews 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES David Patterson, former professor at UC Berkeley A year ago the University of California at Berkeley hosted a retirement celebration for David Patterson, who was hanging it up after a 40-year academic career in computer architecture. Patterson encored the event last May with a personal 16-minute history, chronicling his days as a wrestler in high school and college and a math major at UCLA, followed by a job at Hughes Aircraft and four decades at Berkeley. From writing two books with Stanford University's John Hennessy to chairing the Computing Research Association, Patterson told the audience that a key to his success was doing "one big thing at a time." His next big thing could be enormous. Rather than hitting the beach after retirement, Patterson joined Google in July to work on an ambitious new chip that's designed to run at least 10 times faster than today's processors and is sophisticated enough to handle the intensive computations required for artificial intelligence. It's called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), and Patterson has emerged as one of the principal evangelists. He spoke to about 100 students and faculty members at the Berkeley campus on Wednesday, a few days shy of the anniversary of his retirement celebration. "Four years ago they had this worry and it went to the top of the corporation," said Patterson, 69, while sporting a T-shirt for Google Brain, the company's research group. The fear was that if every Android user had three minutes of conversation translated a day using Google's machine learning technology, "we'd have to double our data centers," he said. Source: Google Google’s tensor processing unit or TPU. Google parent Alphabet already spends $10 billion a year on capital expenses, largely tied to data center costs. And now it's addressing what it calls a "renaissance in machine learning." Deep neural networks, or computers that are modeled to learn and get smarter over time as data sets get bigger and more complicated, require big breakthroughs in hardware efficiency. Patterson, who gave the same talk at Stanford on Thursday, was among the lead authors on a report from Google last month on the TPU's performance. The report concluded that the TPU is running 15 to 30 times faster and 30 to 80 times more efficient than contemporary processors from Intel and Nvidia. The paper, written by 75 engineers, will be delivered next month at the International Symposium on Computer Architecture in Toronto. The report was Patterson's debut project at Google. Once a week he treks down to the Mountain View headquarters and twice a week he works at the company's office in San Francisco. He reports to Jeff Dean, an 18-year Google veteran and head of Google Brain. It's not Patterson's first Google gig — he worked there while on academic sabbatical from 2013 to 2014. This time, he joined the TPU project as a distinguished engineer, a year after the chips were first put to use in Google's data centers and just two months after his retirement party. Not really a retirement Patterson has never been one to sit idle. In 2013, while still teaching, he participated in a powerlifting competition — and set a new California state record for his age group. "Now that I think back, there was no evidence for the assumption that he was retiring except that it was called a retirement celebration," said Mark Hill, a PhD student of Patterson's in 1987, and one of the speakers at his party. Hill, who now chairs the computer sciences department at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said that in computer architecture Patterson is "on the short list of the great ones of the last half of the 20th century." He called the computer architecture book that Patterson wrote with Hennessy the field's most influential textbook of the last 25 years. Google says the TPU is being tested broadly across the company. It's used for every search query as well as for improving maps and navigation, and it was the technology used to power DeepMind's AlphaGo victory over Go legend Lee Sedol last year in Seoul. show chapters Chamath Palihapitiya: I spent 1½ years trying to find the people who made Google's AI chip    Thursday, 16 Mar 2017 | 10:39 AM ET | 00:38 But don't expect Google to compete in the semiconductor market against the likes of Intel and Nvidia. Outside developers who want the sort of performance that Google's processors can offer have to turn to the company's cloud computing service and products like TensorFlow, an open-source software library for machine learning workloads. "They're much better at building tools for themselves than for others," said Chris Nicholson, co-founder and CEO of deep learning start-up Skymind. "They've never really succeeded as a hardware company and I don't see them pursuing that strategy." At least one start-up may be trying to fill in the gaps where Google won't tread. Several engineers from the project have teamed up with investor Chamath Palihapitiya to form a mysterious start-up called Groq. It's still very early days for the TPU. Thus far, the processor has proven effective at what's called inference, or the second phase of deep learning. The first phase is training and — as far as we know — for that Google still counts on off-the-shelf processors. But Google is famous for keeping quiet about its most cutting-edge projects. During his speech at Berkeley, Patterson was asked what's next for his team. He didn't take the bait. Patterson said that one thing he's learned at Google is that, unlike in academia, he's not allowed to talk publicly about future products. "I can say that Google isn't resting," he said. "It seemed like it was a good experience. They didn't give up. Nobody got laid off."

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english?

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd.

Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US."

Amazon Fire TV Stick vs. Google Chromecast: Which Is the Best TV Streaming Device? May 6, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) In the world of media streaming on TV, Amazon Fire TV Stick is the latest entry with features beyond what Google Chromecast and Roku offer. Looking at today’s TV streaming devices will give you an idea of how the Fire TV Stick brings you wealth of digital content including TV shows and movies with a hassle-free operation. Both Chromecast and Fire TV Stick are there to fulfill the same purpose, both can give you 1080p display resolution, but the approach is very different. Nature of Work If you look at the Google Chromecast, you’ll find that it is more about the services Google brings for you on TV. If you can choose functionality while making a compromise with comfort, Chromecast is the device you need. It supports Android as well as iOS devices and streams media on your TV. You can also use the mirror display and can also cast offline and online content directly from PC. When it comes to solving the core purpose and adding much comfort to your TV experience, the Amazon Fire TV Stick brings the difference here and it appears to be taking over Chromecast. The device looks like an extended version of memory sticks, but comes with a Bluetooth remote. Additionally, you get storage option that enables users to store content (up to 1GB). Perhaps, when it comes to combining functionality with comfort, unlike Chromecast, you won’t have to keep your phone around. Fire TV Stick, your TV and remote are enough. Traditional TV Experience Google Chromecast will not disappoint you if you are fed up of multiple remotes lying near you. It doesn’t bring any standalone remote control and turns your smartphone into one. On the other hand, if you do not want to stick to your phone because those notifications distract you from watching your favorite movies, Amazon’s offering will make more sense to you. It is easier to use as compared to the Chromecast. Taking Control If you simply ask someone how much they can do with their Chromecast, you’ll find a scarcity of control. However Google has made sure that it enables your smartphone to play content on your TV when the device is connected, you can’t do anything other than this. But when you take Amazon Fire TV Stick features into account, you will realize that it really has an interface that makes it different and a solid Chromecast alternative. In the Fire TV Stick, you get a ‘Recent’ button so that you can easily start accessing content from where you left. But you won’t get this much freedom with Chromecast as the navigation takes place on connected device and there’s nothing you can do on the TV screen. The Google Chromecast imposes a weird limitation on users that they have to keep their Android, iOS device near even for the smallest things like switching channels or skipping content forward. Content Search If you already own a Google Home, you can easily add voice control to your Chromecast and can search content. But if you do not own the device and do not wish to buy it in future then it is better you forget voice control over the Chromecast. With a dedicated search tab, the Amazon Fire TV Stick, on the other hand, comes with a Bluetooth remote that supports Alexa voice search. Meaning that you can make voice search with Fire TV Stick without paying any additional cost. The only drawback here is that typing on remote to search content appears to be very smooth. But to enable users to perform a search from smartphones, Amazon has launched an app for both Android and iOS. Other Features If you prefer watching movies or TV shows on headphones, the Amazon Fire TV Stick supports Bluetooth and can be connected to your Bluetooth headset, so that you can watch, play and surf peacefully without disturbing anyone in the room. The Verdict Pitting the Google Chromecast and Amazon Fire TV Stick gives an idea that at the core of the functionalities, each of them fulfills the same needs. But Amazon has taken things a little further. Depending on the priorities, needs and the way you watch TV shows, movies buying any of them cannot be considered a bad deal.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english? LondonLeedsFan We don't even have podcasts on Play Music yet in the UK. Srujan Probably for those panicking over losing healthcare protection on their pre-existing conditions. ericshmerick We get it, you don't like him. Your post is wholly inaccurate by the way. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing. I must share with you a job wherein all of tools is actually alloted to you and also it is a relatively easy in addition to really easy work. Not necessary to build your personal website domains and many more., all will be presented to you 100% free. Visitors definitely will browse the landing page so you are going to get compensated for that. Its as simple as that. I'm getting big profits from home from this work exactly like $20000 every month and sometimes more and if you also actually want to get paid same as that then follow these particular not very difficult directions by looking at this homepage .... ➤➤➤http:[email protected] .. Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd. Paul Quinn I debated on that. I think I prefer the ominous nature of it. Reminds me of THE Borg. Nick Riviera It works terribly, like quite a few new services. Amit Interesting. No such issues for me.

Thanks for that info! Zsolt V How about checking first before spreading FUD? Paul Quinn The Google Home support page said at the time of publication and still at this moment, in red print at the top, "This is only available in the US." I had no reason to doubt such basic information. When we discover possible inaccuracies like this in a post, we act as quickly as possible to update the information.

The relatives assert that by allowing Daesh militants to spread propaganda freely on social media, the three companies provided "material support" to the group and enabled attacks such as the one in San Bernardino. "For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group Daesh with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of Daesh over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of Daesh shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google, and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases. 0 0 Families of San Bernardino shooting sue Facebook, Google, Twitter was posted in world of Geo TV - https://www.geo.tv on May 05, 2017 and was last updated on May 05, 2017.

More than 30,000 people were expected to attend the annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik) OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The Latest on Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting (all times local): 2:45 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says Wells Fargo made a huge error in failing to respond promptly to its sales practices scandal. Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday that the bank should have done more to correct the problem once it was discovered. Buffett says Wells Fargo didn't act promptly when it discovered the problem. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Buffett says he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. ___ 2:30 p.m. Warren Buffett continues looking for major acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett told shareholders Saturday that Berkshire could do a very large deal because it has more than $90 billion cash on hand. Buffett says he likes to keep at least $20 billion to $25 billion on hand for emergencies or any large insurance claims, but he's actively looking for a big deal. Currently, Buffett believes he can find a good use for Berkshire's cash, so the company doesn't pay dividends and rarely repurchases its stock. Buffett says the board would look at both options if it ever decided he could generate good returns by investing the money. ___ 1 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says one of the most-important skills his eventual successor will need is a talent for allocating all the cash Berkshire Hathaway's businesses generate. Buffett said at Saturday's annual meeting that it's crucial his successor have what he calls a "money mind." Buffett has no plans to leave his job as chairman and CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate he built through acquisitions over more than 50 years. The 86-year-old told his investors that the company's plan to replace him hasn't changed. Buffett says his successor will have to be able to wisely invest Berkshire's cash without making major mistakes. Currently, Berkshire has more than $90 billion in cash on hand. ___ 11:25 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway's insurance businesses will continue to thrive regardless of who's leading them. At Berkshire's shareholder meeting Saturday, Buffett was asked about the challenges of replacing Ajit Jain because Buffett has heaped praise on Jain for years. Buffett acknowledges some insurance deals might be impossible to replicate once Jain is gone, but says a lot of solid habits are institutionalized at Berkshire's insurance companies. Berkshire owns Geico and General Reinsurance as well as a number of specialized insurers that handle malpractice, worker's compensation and other businesses. For his own position as Berkshire's CEO and chairman, the 86-year-old Buffett says there's been no change in the plan to eventually replace him. ___ 11:10 a.m. It's hard to say exactly how much Berkshire Hathaway would benefit from a major tax cut. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett says the effect to a tax cut would vary across the more than 90 different businesses the conglomerate owns. For instance, at the regulated utilities Berkshire owns, any benefit from a tax cut will be passed on to customers through lower rates. In other businesses, it will depend on how much competitive pressure there is to lower prices after a tax cut. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. ___ 10:45 a.m. Investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that they probably should have recognized Google's brilliance and invested in it. But the top two executives at Berkshire had long ruled out technology companies because they believe it's too hard to predict which ones will prevail. So they missed out on Google even though they knew the business well because Berkshire's Geico insurance unit advertised with the search engine. Munger says in retrospect, he thinks he and Buffett were smart enough to figure out Google's prospects early on, but they didn't. In recent years, Buffett has ventured a bit into tech investing but with mixed results. He said Friday that Berkshire recently sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because the investment hasn't performed as well as he expected. Berkshire holds about 133 million Apple shares, but Buffett says he looks at that more as a consumer products company instead of a technology company. ___ 10 a.m. Investor Warren Buffett says he believes it works better to hold his employees to a high standard and expect them to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. Buffett says he always urges Berkshire Hathaway employees to protect the company's reputation above all and avoid questionable behavior. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. He believes that will help Berkshire avoid scandals like the one that hurt Wells Fargo last year. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Berkshire is known for its decentralized structure with fewer than 30 people at headquarters that allows the more than 90 companies it owns to largely run themselves. "We count very heavily on principles of behavior rather than loads of rules," Buffett said. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up!

Buffett says Berkshire will occasionally have problems because it has 367,000 employees. ___ 9:20 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett paid tribute to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Saturday. Bogle attended Berkshire's meeting Saturday after Buffett praised him in his annual letter to shareholders this year. Buffett has long recommended that most casual investors would be better off investing in index funds steadily over time instead of trying to pick individual stocks. Buffett says Bogle played a major role in creating the index funds that are common today, and that has helped millions of investors earn more because the fees are so cheap. Buffett, who is 86, said Bogle will celebrate his 88th birthday Monday. Buffett joked that if Bogle holds out for just a couple more years, he'll be old enough to qualify for an executive job at Berkshire. Buffett's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 93. ___ 7:10 a.m. When billionaire Warren Buffett toured the exhibit hall where Berkshire Hathaway companies are selling their products outside Berkshire's annual meeting, he was again surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. At Berkshire's annual meeting Saturday, Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd. While he wandered through the hall, Buffett told reporters that he continues to believe the economy is growing steadily at about 2 percent a year. And he told a recent college graduate to try to find career that makes use of her skills and appeals to her passions. Shareholder Elizabeth Varner said it was fun just listening to Buffett while walking near him in the crowd and trying to shoot pictures of the down-to-Earth billionaire. ___ 6:30 a.m. Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders filling an arena to listen to the billionaire investor at the company's annual meeting. The chance to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for more than five hours is again expected to attract more than 30,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday. Seventy-year-old Dave Mueller flew out from Denver, Colorado, for his fourth meeting because he loves hearing the 86-year-old Buffett and 93-year-old Munger talk. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. Shareholder Jerry Meyer said the exhibits are a neat way to learn about Berkshire and boost investor enthusiasm. ___ Online: Follow Josh Funk on Twitter at https://twitter.com/funkwrite Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: www.berkshirehathaway.com Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

As usual with upcoming flagships, not much is known about the upcoming successor. But here are its expected specs that will pose a challenge for the hottest Android right now, the Samsung Galaxy S8. Specs And Features That Should Be Upgraded To Be Competitive 1. Camera. Although the camera on the first Pixel was above average, Google still has much room for improvement. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 remains to be a strong challenger in the camera department, but the Pixel 2 may just have the advantage over the popular flagship: a dual-camera system. According to Value Walk, early renders of the Pixel 2 included dual cameras arranged vertically at the back with the fingerprint scanner right below it. Seeing that this kind of setup is expected in every mainstream flagship that is releasing this year, it won’t be a surprise if Google’s upcoming flagship adopts this feature from the iPhone 7 Plus. 2. Design. The Galaxy S8 may be the best-looking smartphone out there right now, and it would take a lot for others to beat that. The Samsung flagship has effectively ditched the physical home button to allow the curved display to take up the whole front side of the smartphone, making for a beautiful façade. Head-To-Head: Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Vs. Google Pixel XL https://t.co/02DOoCv5OB #S8Plus #galaxyS8 pic.twitter.com/ksBifMoGfl — CRNTestCenter (@CRNTestCenter) May 6, 2017 The path that Google should take here is obvious – the Pixel 2 should also remove the home button and thin out the bezels for a full-display front. While they’re at it, they should also change the dual-color rear design, ditch it completely or choose better colors. 3. Battery. CNET reported that the original Pixel ran continuous video playback for 13 hours – good enough but not enough to be competitive. The same battery draining test was performed on the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus, in which they lasted 16 and 18 hours respectively. If the Google Pixel 2 wants to challenge these devices, it better have upgraded battery and improved optimization to have a longer battery life. 4. Storage Options. Pixel customers only had two internal memory options: 32GB and 128GB. Both choices are enough for some, but considering that the S8 has expandable memory on top of a built-in 64GB storage, Google is losing here. Pixel 2 should be able to offer more memory, which might be a decisive factor for other customers. Google Pixel 2 Release Date Rumored To Be Real Soon We already know that the Google Pixel 2 is going to be great when it is released – whenever that is. Tech Times speculate that it might be nearer than initially thought. Even though the Pixel was released in October last year, its successor may be revealed as early as this month, specifically on the Google I/O event on May 17 to 19. This is primarily because a prototype of Pixel 2 Walleye has already been spotted, which the Inquisitr previously reported on. A Google engineer is already testing the Android O on the smaller device hinting that the search engine company is planning to release it soon. Google Pixel 2 “Walleye” prototype seems to be used for testing Android code already https://t.co/544LEBO2C5 pic.twitter.com/cSgyTgAnQx — android news (@galaxytop1) April 28, 2017 However, Walleye’s siblings haven’t been spotted yet. This could mean that the other Pixel 2 devices with bigger screens – codenamed Muskie and the other one allegedly Taimen – do not have prototypes yet. If so, Google Pixel 2 can be expected to be revealed much later this year. If it is an early bird as reports believe, we may see it as soon as August. But if the tech giant follows its schedule, the next flagship will be unveiled in October and then launched the next month. Let’s just hope that this time, Google fixes its shipment issues so that customers can actually buy one.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english?

I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request.

(AP Photo/Nati Harnik) OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — The Latest on Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting (all times local): 1 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says one of the most-important skills his eventual successor will need is a talent for allocating all the cash Berkshire Hathaway's businesses generate. Buffett said at Saturday's annual meeting that it's crucial his successor have what he calls a "money mind." Buffett has no plans to leave his job as chairman and CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate he built through acquisitions over more than 50 years. The 86-year-old told his investors that the company's plan to replace him hasn't changed. Buffett says his successor will have to be able to wisely invest Berkshire's cash without making major mistakes. Currently, Berkshire has more than $90 billion in cash on hand. ___ 11:25 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway's insurance businesses will continue to thrive regardless of who's leading them. At Berkshire's shareholder meeting Saturday, Buffett was asked about the challenges of replacing Ajit Jain because Buffett has heaped praise on Jain for years. Buffett acknowledges some insurance deals might be impossible to replicate once Jain is gone, but says a lot of solid habits are institutionalized at Berkshire's insurance companies. Berkshire owns Geico and General Reinsurance as well as a number of specialized insurers that handle malpractice, worker's compensation and other businesses. For his own position as Berkshire's CEO and chairman, the 86-year-old Buffett says there's been no change in the plan to eventually replace him. ___ 11:10 a.m. It's hard to say exactly how much Berkshire Hathaway would benefit from a major tax cut. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett says the effect to a tax cut would vary across the more than 90 different businesses the conglomerate owns. For instance, at the regulated utilities Berkshire owns, any benefit from a tax cut will be passed on to customers through lower rates. In other businesses, it will depend on how much competitive pressure there is to lower prices after a tax cut. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. ___ 10:45 a.m. Investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that they probably should have recognized Google's brilliance and invested in it. But the top two executives at Berkshire had long ruled out technology companies because they believe it's too hard to predict which ones will prevail. So they missed out on Google even though they knew the business well because Berkshire's Geico insurance unit advertised with the search engine. Munger says in retrospect, he thinks he and Buffett were smart enough to figure out Google's prospects early on, but they didn't. In recent years, Buffett has ventured a bit into tech investing but with mixed results. He said Friday that Berkshire recently sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because the investment hasn't performed as well as he expected. Berkshire holds about 133 million Apple shares, but Buffett says he looks at that more as a consumer products company instead of a technology company. ___ 10 a.m. Investor Warren Buffett says he believes it works better to hold his employees to a high standard and expect them to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. Buffett says he always urges Berkshire Hathaway employees to protect the company's reputation above all and avoid questionable behavior. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. He believes that will help Berkshire avoid scandals like the one that hurt Wells Fargo last year. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Berkshire is known for its decentralized structure with fewer than 30 people at headquarters that allows the more than 90 companies it owns to largely run themselves. "We count very heavily on principles of behavior rather than loads of rules," Buffett said. Buffett says Berkshire will occasionally have problems because it has 367,000 employees. ___ 9:20 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett paid tribute to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Saturday. Bogle attended Berkshire's meeting Saturday after Buffett praised him in his annual letter to shareholders this year. Get the Bottom Line from Nicklaus and Gallagher Who's hired? Check our People in Business See how much St. Louis CEOs were paid See how St. Louis stocks are faring Buffett has long recommended that most casual investors would be better off investing in index funds steadily over time instead of trying to pick individual stocks. Buffett says Bogle played a major role in creating the index funds that are common today, and that has helped millions of investors earn more because the fees are so cheap. Buffett, who is 86, said Bogle will celebrate his 88th birthday Monday. Buffett joked that if Bogle holds out for just a couple more years, he'll be old enough to qualify for an executive job at Berkshire. Buffett's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 93. ___ 7:10 a.m. When billionaire Warren Buffett toured the exhibit hall where Berkshire Hathaway companies are selling their products outside Berkshire's annual meeting, he was again surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. At Berkshire's annual meeting Saturday, Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd. While he wandered through the hall, Buffett told reporters that he continues to believe the economy is growing steadily at about 2 percent a year. And he told a recent college graduate to try to find career that makes use of her skills and appeals to her passions. Shareholder Elizabeth Varner said it was fun just listening to Buffett while walking near him in the crowd and trying to shoot pictures of the down-to-Earth billionaire. ___ 6:30 a.m. Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders filling an arena to listen to the billionaire investor at the company's annual meeting. The chance to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for more than five hours is again expected to attract more than 30,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday. Seventy-year-old Dave Mueller flew out from Denver, Colorado, for his fourth meeting because he loves hearing the 86-year-old Buffett and 93-year-old Munger talk. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. Shareholder Jerry Meyer said the exhibits are a neat way to learn about Berkshire and boost investor enthusiasm. ___ Online: Follow Josh Funk on Twitter at https://twitter.com/funkwrite Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: www.berkshirehathaway.com Business Briefing from St. Louis Post-Dispatch Make it your business.

But more importantly, this article will show how some ideas are true or not. Building a better SEO B.S. Detector will show you how to be more discerning of what you are told to believe and how to detect SEO B.S. when confronted with it. I believe it will make you a better search marketer. The Problem with Common Sense The problem with good ideas is that they are reasonable and make a lot sense. For thousands of years the idea that the world was flat was reasonable and made a lot of sense. That is an example of how relying on common sense and “good ideas” can lead to bad ideas. Correlation Does Not Imply Causation For example, several years ago someone observed that the top ranking sites across thousands of keyword phrases all had something in common: The top ranked sites had a strong social media presence, particularly in the form of Facebook Likes. The conclusion was reached that Facebook Likes must be a ranking factor. Makes sense but it was not true. There was an easy way to disprove that theory and that was by reviewing the latest information retrieval literature (patents and academic research). A review of that literature would have demonstrated that there was no research or patent on a successful system for using social media signals as a ranking factor. The Problem with Observation Another area to be aware of is the problem of observation. The perspective of the person viewing an event will change how they view that event. Remember the old fable about the blind men who were trying to describe an elephant? One blind man grabbed the trunk and concluded that an elephant is like a snake. Another blind man ran his hands across the legs and declared that an elephant is like a tree, and so on. The same thing happens in the SEO industry where people in different niches experience an algorithm change in different ways. What usually ends up happening is that the people with the loudest voices end up dictating what the rest of the industry believes happened and those with contrary experiences are ignored. This happened with the very first Phantom Update where the industry rushed to embrace the idea that Google was targeting sites with poor user experience while ignoring the insights provided by a HubPages blog post about the Phantom Update that noticed that the change did not affect their site the same way, that certain parts were affected more. Nobody asked why the so-called update would affect some pages more than others. It’s possible that the 2015 event that was called the Phantom Update was about more than the user experience and too many ads. @martinibuster very. core update == phantom ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ — Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) March 21, 2017 Consider the Perspective from Multiple Experiences It turns out that those updates were not actually algorithm updates. They were simply Google adjusting various parts of their existing algorithm. Nothing was added to the algorithm, it was simply an update to their core ranking algorithm. An actual update has traditionally been when Google added something new to the algorithm, typically to target a certain kind of spam or improve their ability to understand natural language and so on. Not All Updates Target Spam This is very important. Every time a change happens at Google, the SEO industry responds by declaring that Google “targeted” a certain kind of spam. Historically, and this is a fact, Google updates were just as likely to be an improvement in its ability to “target” high quality content as it was to “target” low quality content. But for some reason the SEO industry is obsessed with interpreting every update as targeting low quality. Consider a scenario in which Google rolled out an algorithm that improved its ability to understand content itself and how to connect that content to the user intent behind each search query. In that scenario low quality content that targeted keywords (but not a users intent) would naturally stop ranking and higher quality content that matched a searcher’s user intent would start ranking. This kind of change would affect a wide range of websites. Sites that were ranking because of their links would stop ranking if their content was not identified as an accurate answer to a search query. The same could happen to other sites that contained too many ads. The abundance of ads were not a factor, the inability to properly answer the query were the factor that kept that site from ranking. Similarly, for another site, the abundance of anchor text in links were not the factor that kept another site from ranking, it was the inability to properly answer the search query that was the answer. That’s the effect of an algorithm focusing on better understanding content, but not an algorithm that focuses on demoting poor quality sites or sites with excessive anchor text. That kind of core update would not be targeting low quality sites but the SEO industry would perceive it as doing that; and the SEO industry would have been wrong. I believe the SEO industry has been wrong about Phantom and this explanation is why: Not all algorithm changes target spam. Look for Validation of a Theory The hallmark of a shaky SEO strategy is the lack of links to patents or scientific research. Always check to see if a claim is backed up by a link to a patent or research because those links will prove that the hypothesis has a chance of being real. Any time an SEO Guru makes a claim about Google’s algorithm, look for a link to a patent. Photos of Google analytics, photos of check stubs and personal anecdotes do not count as much as solid proof that something is possible. I’m going to discuss some of these hare brained SEO strategies currently making the rounds to illustrate how this works. 1. LSI and SEO LSI (latent semantic indexing) was invented to help search engines distinguish between the multiple meanings of a word. That was over 20 years ago. LSI has little to zero relevance to how search engines rank websites today. Search engines today incorporate databases of information to understand concepts such as people, places and things and how those concepts relate to keywords. Search engines today can promote a site from the second page to the first page of the results page if the algorithm understands that it answers the question better than the core ranking algorithm does. LSI is training wheels for search engines.

Link to .Edu and .Gov Sites This is a strategy that many SEOs will go to their graves clinging onto. Linking out to authority sites was an idea based on the HITS algorithm, from around 1996 or 1999. Search for Hubs and Authorities + Kleinberg and you’ll find everything you need about it. That very ancient research is where the SEO strategy of linking out to authority sites started. Later on, SEOs adapted that hubs and authority strategy to Google even though there are no current patents or research to indicate that Google or any other search engine uses a hubs and authority technology from 1999 in its algorithm. It’s not relevant to how search engines rank websites today. So why do SEOs continue to promote this idea without linking to any patents or research? 3. Keywords in H1, H2, etc Keywords in headers are not relevant to how modern search engines work today. Google and Bing are not matching keywords on a web page to keywords in a search query. The SEO industry likes to have it both ways by talking about entities and natural language processing while still clinging to an idea about keyword pattern matching that’s straight from the 1990s. Don’t believe me? Search with Google and see how many of your keywords are in the web pages of the top 10 ranked web pages. Conclusion Those are three examples of common SEO strategies that are based on old and outdated algorithms. I demonstrated how to understand false SEO strategies.

Thanks to Android apps, the OS is only becoming more and more useful too. One of the hardest parts of Chrome OS, though, is picking a machine to run it on. So, let’s take a look at the best Chromebooks you can buy today… The best gifts for Android users NEW FOR MAY: Lenovo Flex 11 Lenovo is no stranger to Chrome OS and for 2017, it’s first notable release for 2017 is the Flex 11. This Chromebook, designed with education in mind, is designed to be affordable and offer an experience ready for Android apps, even though they won’t be enabled out of the box. The Flex 11 is powered by the quad-core MTK 8173C processor clocked at 2.1GHz paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The machine also offers an 11.6-inch 1366×768 IPS touchscreen which is on a 360-degree hinge. The Flex 11 also doesn’t skimp on ports, offering a USB-C port, a full-size USB 3.0 port, an HDMI port, and a full-size SD card slot. It also features improved drop resistance and limited water resistance. It also offers a 45 watt-hour battery that should be enough to power it through a full day. This machine is obviously targeted at education, but general consumers can also easily buy it from Lenovo’s website for $279. FROM EARLIER THIS YEAR: Samsung Chromebook Plus The headliner in the Chrome OS market today is the Samsung Chromebook Plus. Samsung’s latest machine is a premium device designed for Android apps that is one of the more well thought-out machines in recent memory. It offers a 12.3-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio that comes in at 2400×1600. It’s a very sharp display which looks stunning, and with a responsive touchscreen that can flip all the way around, it makes for a solid tablet replacement. Android apps are enabled out of the box on this one as well, meaning that users can easily use this machine both for tasks in Chrome and in their favorite apps. It also makes Samsung’s embedded stylus possible, with improved functionality through a couple of pre-loaded apps. The Chromebook Plus runs on top of a hexa-core ARM-based chipset developer in collaboration with Google. The OP1 chipset is well optimized for Chrome and Android apps, and it works pretty well on the Plus. Paired with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, it makes for a solid experience overall. Samsung has made the decision to go all-in on USB-C on the Chromebook Plus as well, leaving users with two USB-C ports for charging, data transfer, and output. It’s not ideal, but it’s also not a big deal on this sort of machine. Priced at $449, Samsung is certainly going for the higher end of the market, but after using it, I certainly feel it’s worth the asking price. You can pick up the Samsung Chromebook Plus from Amazon (where it’s commonly on sale), the Google Store, Best Buy, and various other retailers. ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA The other big release we’ve seen in 2017 has been the ASUS Chromebook Flip C302CA. This machine closely rivals the Chromebook Plus with a premium design, but takes a slightly different approach with the overall package. The C302CA offers Android apps (in the beta channel only for now) and was clearly designed with them in mind. The 12.5-inch 1080p touchscreen display is great for using apps, and the 16:9 aspect ratio feels natural when using media applications as well. It also offers an excellent backlit keyboard and all-day battery life, with charging support via the two USB-C ports, which are the only ports found on the machine. ASUS has packed this Chromebook with Intel’s Core m3 chipset, 64GB of storage, and 4GB of RAM. That Intel chipset makes the C302CA a great choice for those who need some extra power, and it works very well. Priced at $499, the C302CA isn’t necessarily for the first time Chromebook buyer, but it’s an excellent option that will become an even better value when Android apps make their way to the stable channel. Retailers such as Amazon, Newegg, and Best Buy offer it. HP Chromebook 13 Google’s Chromebook Pixel was easily the best of the best when it comes to Chromebooks, but it’s been long gone. For users who crave a similarly premium experience, the HP Chromebook 13 is an excellent option. It offers a striking design made from premium materials and a solid set of specifications. The Chromebook 13 runs on top of an Intel Pentium processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and has a 13.3-inch 3200×1800 IPS display. It also offers 11.5 hours of battery life and two USB-C ports along with full-size USB ports and a B&O enhanced headphone jack. The keyboard is also backlit. Pricing for the HP Chromebook 13 starts at about $500 from retailers such as HP itself, Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, and B&HPhoto. B&H, however, does offer the machine in a few other configurations, maxing out with an Intel Core m7 processor and 16GB of RAM for about $1,000. Acer Chromebook 14 Acer is one of the most popular Chromebook makers, and that’s why it has more than one option on this list. The first, though, is the Acer Chromebook 14. Offering up a metal build, Intel Celeron chipset, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, this is a pretty respectable offering from the company. This is certainly a Chrome OS-first experience, though, as the screen doesn’t flip around, nor does the machine feature a touchscreen for using Android apps (although it will still receive them, eventually). Priced at $299, the Chromebook 14 isn’t a bad deal. It lacks some of the newer perks of modern Chromebooks, like USB-C, but it’s definitely a good choice. It’s available in both silver and gold from retailers such as Amazon. You can learn more in our full review. Acer Chromebook N7 (C731) Education is the biggest market for Chrome OS, and hardware is constantly being released with that in mind. One of the more recent options has been the Acer Chromebook N7, launched back at CES 2017. This machine offers a lot for its $229 price tag, including an Intel Celeron chipset, 4GB of RAM, 16GB of storage, and an 11.6-inch IPS touchscreen HD display. Like many other Chromebooks with an education focus, the N7 offers improved durability with drop and water resistance. It unfortunately doesn’t feature USB-C, but does offer up two USB 3.0 ports, HDMI, a full-size SD card reader, and, of course, a headphone jack. The Acer Chromebook N7 is available for purchase from Amazon, Newegg, Walmart, and other retailers. Acer R11 If you’re looking to replace your aging Android tablet with a Chromebook, the Acer R11 is a solid option. It’s one of the few Chromebooks on the market today that features Android apps out of the box, and it’s a great showcase for the functionality thanks to the 360-degree hinge. Running on top of an Intel Celeron processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage, the R11 offers a great experience on Chrome OS. Its age causes it to lack thing like USB-C, but it features plenty of full-size USB ports, HDMI, and a full-size SD card slot to make up for that. At $279, it’s a solid machine to pick up. Acer Chromebook 15 If you’re looking for affordability above all else, it doesn’t get much better than the Acer Chromebook 15. Priced at just $199, this machine offers a huge 15.6-inch display (albeit a low-resolution one), a solid keyboard, wide array of ports, and suprisingly good performance. It packs an Intel Celeron chipset, 2GB of RAM, and 16GB of storage. It’s a bare bones machine for sure, but it gets the job done. It’s easy to find the 2016 model at Walmart, but if you’re looking for some extra power or a better display, other models are available for purchase on Amazon for an extra $50-$100.

More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the annual meeting, and participate in company-sponsored activities, though the main attraction is CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger's Q&A session on Saturday. Nati Harnik AP Photo Business May 06, 2017 3:08 PM The Latest: Berkshire shareholders reject 3 proposals The Associated Press LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Reddit Print Order Reprint of this Story OMAHA, Neb. The Latest on Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting (all times local): 4:50 p.m. Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have rejected three proposals that would have required the company to sell off stock investments linked to fossil fuels and disclose more information about its political contributions and methane emissions. Advocacy groups proposed the measures because they wanted Berkshire to change its practices. Buffett and Berkshire's board opposed all three shareholder measures Saturday. The board argued that both the proposed reports are unnecessary and selling off stocks tied to fossil fuels could hurt Berkshire's investment returns. With Buffett controlling about one-third of the vote, the measures faced an uphill battle. But the groups pushing the proposals had an opportunity to make their case before thousands of Berkshire shareholders. Climate scientist Mark Mann with Penn State University urged Buffett and Berkshire shareholders to take a stand against climate change. He said doing so could add to the company's legacy, but the proposal failed. ___ 4:20 p.m. Eighty-six-year-old Warren Buffett and 93-year-old Charlie Munger say they both try to continue learning and that shows up in the investments they've made for Berkshire Hathaway in recent years. Munger says Berkshire's purchase of 133 million shares of Apple stock shows Buffett is learning because for decades Buffett resisted investing in technology companies. Buffett says he came to realize that Apple behaves more like a consumer products company than a tech company, so he became comfortable investing in it. ___ 3:25 p.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says growing health care costs continue to be a drag on the performance of U.S. businesses, and he's not sure the reform package Republicans passed will do much to help that. Buffett said Saturday that health care costs have gone up incredibly, and are expected to continue increasing. The high cost of U.S. health care puts American businesses at a competitive disadvantage with other countries. Buffett says the one thing he's sure the Republican reforms will do is deliver a big tax cut to people like him with more than $250,000 income and significant investment income. ___ 2:45 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says Wells Fargo made a huge error in failing to respond promptly to its sales practices scandal. Buffett told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders Saturday that the bank should have done more to correct the problem once it was discovered. Buffett says Wells Fargo didn't act promptly when it discovered the problem. The bank said last fall that its employees opened up 2 million bank accounts without customer approval to meet unrealistic sales goals. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Buffett says he still believes in the long-term prospects of the bank even though Wells Fargo mishandled the scandal. ___ 2:30 p.m. Warren Buffett continues looking for major acquisitions for Berkshire Hathaway. Buffett told shareholders Saturday that Berkshire could do a very large deal because it has more than $90 billion cash on hand. Buffett says he likes to keep at least $20 billion to $25 billion on hand for emergencies or any large insurance claims, but he's actively looking for a big deal. Currently, Buffett believes he can find a good use for Berkshire's cash, so the company doesn't pay dividends and rarely repurchases its stock. Buffett says the board would look at both options if it ever decided he could generate good returns by investing the money. ___ 1 p.m. Investor Warren Buffett says one of the most-important skills his eventual successor will need is a talent for allocating all the cash Berkshire Hathaway's businesses generate. Buffett said at Saturday's annual meeting that it's crucial his successor have what he calls a "money mind." Buffett has no plans to leave his job as chairman and CEO of the Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate he built through acquisitions over more than 50 years. The 86-year-old told his investors that the company's plan to replace him hasn't changed. Buffett says his successor will have to be able to wisely invest Berkshire's cash without making major mistakes. Currently, Berkshire has more than $90 billion in cash on hand. ___ 11:25 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett says Berkshire Hathaway's insurance businesses will continue to thrive regardless of who's leading them. At Berkshire's shareholder meeting Saturday, Buffett was asked about the challenges of replacing Ajit Jain because Buffett has heaped praise on Jain for years. Buffett acknowledges some insurance deals might be impossible to replicate once Jain is gone, but says a lot of solid habits are institutionalized at Berkshire's insurance companies. Berkshire owns Geico and General Reinsurance as well as a number of specialized insurers that handle malpractice, worker's compensation and other businesses. For his own position as Berkshire's CEO and chairman, the 86-year-old Buffett says there's been no change in the plan to eventually replace him. ___ 11:10 a.m. It's hard to say exactly how much Berkshire Hathaway would benefit from a major tax cut. Berkshire CEO Warren Buffett says the effect to a tax cut would vary across the more than 90 different businesses the conglomerate owns. For instance, at the regulated utilities Berkshire owns, any benefit from a tax cut will be passed on to customers through lower rates. In other businesses, it will depend on how much competitive pressure there is to lower prices after a tax cut. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. ___ 10:45 a.m. Investors Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger told Berkshire Hathaway shareholders that they probably should have recognized Google's brilliance and invested in it. But the top two executives at Berkshire had long ruled out technology companies because they believe it's too hard to predict which ones will prevail. So they missed out on Google even though they knew the business well because Berkshire's Geico insurance unit advertised with the search engine. Munger says in retrospect, he thinks he and Buffett were smart enough to figure out Google's prospects early on, but they didn't. In recent years, Buffett has ventured a bit into tech investing but with mixed results. He said Friday that Berkshire recently sold off one-third of its 81 million IBM shares because the investment hasn't performed as well as he expected. Berkshire holds about 133 million Apple shares, but Buffett says he looks at that more as a consumer products company instead of a technology company. ___ 10 a.m. Investor Warren Buffett says he believes it works better to hold his employees to a high standard and expect them to do the right thing instead of imposing extensive rules. Buffett says he always urges Berkshire Hathaway employees to protect the company's reputation above all and avoid questionable behavior. Buffett made his comments during the company's annual meeting Saturday in Omaha, Nebraska. He believes that will help Berkshire avoid scandals like the one that hurt Wells Fargo last year. Berkshire is Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder. Berkshire is known for its decentralized structure with fewer than 30 people at headquarters that allows the more than 90 companies it owns to largely run themselves. "We count very heavily on principles of behavior rather than loads of rules," Buffett said. Buffett says Berkshire will occasionally have problems because it has 367,000 employees. ___ 9:20 a.m. Billionaire Warren Buffett paid tribute to Vanguard founder Jack Bogle at Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting Saturday. Bogle attended Berkshire's meeting Saturday after Buffett praised him in his annual letter to shareholders this year. Buffett has long recommended that most casual investors would be better off investing in index funds steadily over time instead of trying to pick individual stocks. Buffett says Bogle played a major role in creating the index funds that are common today, and that has helped millions of investors earn more because the fees are so cheap. Buffett, who is 86, said Bogle will celebrate his 88th birthday Monday. Buffett joked that if Bogle holds out for just a couple more years, he'll be old enough to qualify for an executive job at Berkshire. Buffett's Vice Chairman Charlie Munger is 93. ___ 7:10 a.m. When billionaire Warren Buffett toured the exhibit hall where Berkshire Hathaway companies are selling their products outside Berkshire's annual meeting, he was again surrounded by a pack of reporters, shareholders and security officers. At Berkshire's annual meeting Saturday, Buffett is the celebrity that everyone wants to get close to. While Buffett met Mr. Peanut at the Kraft Heinz booth, Miami Dolphins defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh wandered a few feet away without a crowd. While he wandered through the hall, Buffett told reporters that he continues to believe the economy is growing steadily at about 2 percent a year. And he told a recent college graduate to try to find career that makes use of her skills and appeals to her passions. Shareholder Elizabeth Varner said it was fun just listening to Buffett while walking near him in the crowd and trying to shoot pictures of the down-to-Earth billionaire. ___ 6:30 a.m. Listening to Warren Buffett never gets old to the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway shareholders filling an arena to listen to the billionaire investor at the company's annual meeting. The chance to hear Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger field questions for more than five hours is again expected to attract more than 30,000 people to Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday. Seventy-year-old Dave Mueller flew out from Denver, Colorado, for his fourth meeting because he loves hearing the 86-year-old Buffett and 93-year-old Munger talk. Dozens of companies Berkshire owns set up booths in an adjoining 200,000-square-foot exhibit hall to sell their products and take questions about their businesses. Shareholder Jerry Meyer said the exhibits are a neat way to learn about Berkshire and boost investor enthusiasm. ___ Online: Follow Josh Funk on Twitter at https://twitter.com/funkwrite Berkshire Hathaway Inc.: www.berkshirehathaway.com Talking Warren Buffett dolls are offered for sale at the Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting as shareholders visit and shop at company subsidiaries in Omaha, Neb., Friday, May 5, 2017.

Pre-order: Surface Laptop Smooth transition 5 tips to help Windows Mobile users switch to Android By Richard Devine Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 10:00 am EDT 340 Comments It might hurt a little, but if you're a Windows 10 Mobile user thinking of jumping ship to Android, we're here to help. One of Android's most redeeming features is how open it is. You're forced to have some Google involvement. But the truth is, you can make the switch and still be all about Microsoft if you want to. After all, why should you give up the services you love just because you change phone platforms? The sad truth is Windows 10 Mobile just isn't competing right now, and its future is unclear. Of course, we'd much prefer the opposite situation, but cold hard facts are impossible to ignore. If you're looking elsewhere and Android is where you're headed, we have some tips to make the transition as painless as possible. 1. Sign up for a Google account first The only absolute Google necessity you need on an Android phone is a Google Account. Without one, you can't sign in to the phone or download apps. So if you don't already have a Google Account, get one. It's easier to do on your PC than on a phone, so it's a good idea to do it in advance. You're not required to have a credit card on file to download apps or content from the Google Play Store, so you can literally just sign up for an account and use it to log into your phone. You don't even have to use the Gmail app or any other forward-facing Google services. If you want to buy apps without using a credit card, you'll need to pick up Google Play vouchers from a retailer and redeem the codes. Sign up for a Google Account 2. Microsoft it all up If you're going to be keeping all your Microsoft services and accounts intact (why wouldn't you?), you'll be happy to know Android is your friend. Whether you just want to use Outlook, Office or Skype, or go nuts and install Microsoft's own Android launcher and lockscreen, there's a ton of Microsoft apps in the Play Store. And they're mostly pretty darn good.You won't have to cancel Groove. You can still get the Xbox app. And your Outlook mail and calendars are safe. Better yet, Microsoft has a single app to help you find and download all of its other apps. Download Microsoft Apps from the Google Play Store 3. Move your contacts to Google While you may want to limit your Google involvement, if you're moving to an Android phone it's a good idea to sync your contacts to your Google Account. That way, it's all easier to manage, and if you ever need to go back to Windows (or over to an iPhone), it'll be simple to work with them. The easiest way to do this is to go into Outlook on the web and export your entire contacts database as a CSV file. Here's how: Log in to Outlook.com. Navigate to People. Click the manage dropdown. Select export contacts. Click export. All your Outlook contacts will be saved in a single file that you can import to your Google Account. This is another good reason to setup your Google Account before you get your new phone, because you'll be able to just sign in and your contacts will be there. Importing them into your Google Account is pretty straightforward. Go to contacts.google.com. Sign in with your Google Account. Click more. Click import and choose the CSV file you saved above. Any new contacts you add to your Android phone can be synced with all of your existing contacts in one place on your Google Account. So even if you're not using Gmail, it's worth doing. 4. Use Cortana Cortana can't do quite as much on Android as on Windows, but it's still pretty useful for more than just replacing the Google Assistant. On Android, you can use Cortana to sync notifications to your PC, which is handy to have on any platform. But because you're signed in with your Microsoft Account anyway, everything you already set up from Windows will be there, too. We also happen to think that Cortana has a better personality than Google Assistant — and a better name! Download Cortana from the Google Play Store 5. Install the Windows Central Android app! All the folks at Windows Central still love you even if you're going over to using an Android phone. Windows Central is committed to providing all the Microsoft content you want, and we've got an app in the Google Play Store so you can keep tabs from your new phone. The experience is a little different, but the great content is the same. You'll also want to keep checking out our sibling site Android Central and its Android app. Then you'll always have the best of both worlds. Download the Windows Central app for Android from the Google Play Store Your tips These are some basic tips to help get started on an easy, Microsoft-filled life on Android.

I'm talking about a high end smartphone... At this point, if HP introduced an updated X3, and MS continues to update WM, I'm NOT going anywhere..... The only thing that makes it a little difficult is the sole fact that Rudy (and others like him) seem to have stopped future development, and updates for their current apps. I'm not sure if this is completely accurate, but it seems to be the case.. His development alone could keep a lot of fans onboard. I think WC should interview several of WP's closest developers to see what their plans for WM10 are. That may be a good deciding factor whether some of us think it's time to switch, or not... Yes, run an article (a QandA) featuring those developers that 'showed' the strongest support for WP, and let fans see what their current stance on WM is.. That is a great idea. ......... On a side note... Can't we just save ALL the iDroid articles for Mondays? You know, get them over with, and out of site, so we can enjoy the rest of our week?..

I've always ragged MS for their poor efforts towards making WP more popular (I know it could've had double digit market share even without every popular app, but not the way it is now).... I've always praised MS when they did a good job.. I've said my points over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over X(1000)³, until my face has turned blue, AND I'M BLACK!!!... I've been using Windows on a mobile device since the days of WinMo 3.0, and I STILL have my Samsung Blackjack. Still have it❗❗...... I know just what I'm talking about, and my opinions deserve respect, like them, or not...... And, I'm still here.... I traded my Focus in, my ex GF ran off with my 920, the 1520 is in my closet resting in peace (bless It's heart😌), and I'm texting you via this white lackluster Lumia 950 sans XL😬... Yes, 950, because MS didn't have the balls to convince AT&amp;T to carry the XL, and I was/am too poor to buy one outright. And, I'm honest. IDK, what do I have to lose?... But, I have faith, not to be confused with naivety.. I know how Fuukt WM is right now. I know, ok, I honestly get it, and I admit it..... BUT, I'M NOT SWITCHING UNTIL I ABSOLUTELY HAVE NO DAMN CHOICE BUT TO SWITCH! (Honestly, I'm a cracked screen away from switching😂)... I'm a winner, not a looser, and I don't give up.. Yes, I'm a dumb a$$ MoFo, yes I admit that. But, I'm a stupid a$$ with dignity, and I hold my head UP high. I do.... I do, I do, I do! ................. But, no I haven't changed.... Still here.

If it some day will not, i'll see what to do then. I think, ms strategy is selfdestroying. They will never reach more people on other oses with their apps (especially not with groove, Bing, onedrive, outlook and close to everything else with maybe the exception of word and excel but lets face it: That is only working with des or continuum too) than they did with wm/wp. More likely they will have less... If i would be using android or ios there is no reason to use ms software there. Windows on arm is the next step and till that is happening, i'll use my phone as long as it does what it should for me. Microsoft should have brought out one iteration of phones (like a 560, 660, 960) to overcome the gap to win on arm. What they are doing now is harming the ecosystem of windows as a hole, is bad for their reputation and bad for future plans. And there is nothing more expensive than harming the ecosystem and trust of people into the brand. 3 new phones would not be hard to do and would not have cost them much money but would have helped the ecosystem to stay alive for windows s, windows and windows mobile and in the end anything else. 0 6 hours ago Reply Ma Rio For all I care Facebook, Messenger, Readit, Skype, and Windows Central work either ok or well enough, so it's all good for me even if they never update those apps again.

Whilst their services like office, skype, groove and Xbox will retain my custom to start with, it might not be long before iTunes and FaceTime take over (all my friends have iPhones)...

Android doesn't have a real PC option yet. . I don't want to buy one platform, and then bolt on a bunch of services from another ecosystem. I prefer to just embrace the ecosystem because the integrations will be better and I know the platform and services will work seamlessly. Plus, they are just easier to use. Like Siri on iPhone instead of Cortana. They are comparable services. One may say, "But Cortana does X better" and that may be true, but using the native services will always be more fluid. Plus, the platform and services will enhance over time in harmony. . That said, and with Phone first, PC second, wearables third, and home entertainment forth, here are my options . Microsoft: - Phone options vanishing fast, no clear leadership, strategy, vision, or urgency on the part of leadership (Nadella). - PC's are clearly the best, and they continue to invest heavily on making sure they stay ahead. - Wearables are just another example of the lack of fight at Microsoft under Nadella. Bing would have never made it to profitability under Nadella because it took years of losses. With the discontinuation of Band 3, I will have to move when my last Band 2 dies. - Home entertainment give Microsoft an advantage because of Xbox One and the upcoming Scorpio. . Google: - Phone options are amazing and just getting better. They have all the apps, and are rapidly becoming a monopoly. - PC's they really don't have options. Chromebooks are coming along, and with Android apps they are a real threat, but they're a couple years away from a real alternative for me. - Wearables are again a strength because the just keep grinding. First versions suck, second versions are ok, third version are interesting, and 4th versions are gold. Microsoft quit the game at version 2. - Home entertainment has some options, but nothing that compares to an Xbox . Apple: - Phone they have the gold standard device. I use it for work (corporate and business apps are required), and I still find Windows a better interface... but Microsoft was behind and then decided to retrench. - PC's they have the only real option here. Again, I prefer Windows, and it appears Apple is losing ground. - Wearables is a strength because the Apple Watch is very nice and full featured. - Home entertainment is a weakness, but they do have Apple TV. Although Apple's biggest weakness so far, continued investment could make it plausible. . All the ecosystems have basic services like cloud storage, personal assistants, mail, etc. I don't want to (or need to) create a Frankenstein platform or ecosystem. . I keep holding out hope for Microsoft, but Nadella just rambles on and on very poetically, but he isn't producing any consumer results. As an example of his consumer innovation, he always mentions how Microsoft introduced the idea of the 2-in-1. However, it launched under Ballmer years before he took over. It was blasted early, but Ballmer kept rolling out better versions (dropping RT) and it was turning the corner already by the time Nadella took over. If launched under Nadella, I believe he would have quit after Surface Pro 2. Cook appears to be a nice version of Ballmer. I don't believe he'll let Apple flop on his watch, but Google is taking his lunch money. Google is still run by the founders. They are aggressive, will fight, and even lose money in one area to win wars down the road. As long as founders are still engaged, I believe they have an advantage of drive and passion. 1 14 hours ago Reply rodneyej Sounds like a sound unbiased opinion. Nice "write" up..

So happy as a clam. 12 16 hours ago Reply Sedp23 Facebook is outdated at least 3 years old 0 14 hours ago Reply Yangstax Even you switch back to Android later, you can still keep your L950 and Dock forever for the Continuum sake.  That's my plan anyway.  I have 3 TVs and 3 Continuum Docks (2 MS and 1 HP).  My wife uses a L950 and I use a L950XL.  If we are forced to switch in the future, the L950 and L950XL will stay to support Continuum on big screens forever.  The beauty of using Continuum is that we can pin all our favorite entertainment sites in MS Edge on the Start screen and access them directly without searching.  The HP Dock works nice especially with the wired Ethernet connection.  It is super smooth. 0 12 hours ago Reply Basi Abodes What tips you have,for keeping Windows Phone users in this platform... 13 16 hours ago Reply robdmau A major reason I stay is the ability to mute a group message.

You'll be adding your Microsoft account for Cortana anyway, so you're pretty much there. A Microsoft account added as Active Exchange Sync will pull contacts (read and write capable), calendars, and email with pretty much any email app. I use the samsung email and calendar apps. One calendar rub is it seems the samsung app, or just using EAS, I only see one calendar as if they were merged into one. Maybe I just did something wrong, but I just turned off the other calendar (US holidays).   As for item 5... Well I use the browser because it's faster and prettier than the Android Windows Central app. What I miss from the Windows app is push notifications. Using the samsung browser, it is possible to install ad block. The browser is fast and smooth, and can also store passwords for you that get unlocked with whatever biometric you choose. 4 16 hours ago Reply netmann Do you have Dark Mode on your GS8+? 0 15 hours ago Reply veneziaad There does not appear to be a universal switch for dark themes. The settings app is a white background, and several Samsung system apps are likewise (messaging, phone to name two). Apps might do it, like Twitter and Windows Central, but that's on a per app basis and not OS controlled. 0 15 hours ago Reply msweig Samsung has themes, and there are several that will give you a dark mode for the basic phone apps (so the background in settings, phone, etc turns black). 0 7 hours ago Reply TheRealScottR What about contacts? Any way to update outlook contacts using Android? I have not found a good solution.  0 14 hours ago Reply veneziaad Like my OP states, when the account is added to Android as an Exchange Active Sync account, they just show up like you would expect. I use Samsung's default contacts app, and it has successfully seen all my contacts and allowed me to save changes to them that go back up to the EAS server no problem. Your mileage may vary based on which contacts app you use. 0 14 hours ago Reply I_am_flashfire4 What is Exchange Active Sync and how do I set it up? 0 11 hours ago Reply beachedwhale42 Went from a 640 with W10M to a G5 Plus and have been loving it.

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english?

I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme."

How companies in Switzerland become best places to work

May 5, 2017 - 11:45

A new ranking shows the best firms to work for in Switzerland – with Google topping the large companies for a third time in a row. Important to employees in all categories: a respectful and motivational work culture.


In all, 29 companies were awarded Best Workplaces in Switzerland in the Great Place to Work® Award Ceremony in Zurich on Thursday evening. The results were based on a survey of 15,000 employees across the country.


Heading the large companies category (250+ employees) was Google Switzerland. Among the medium companies (50-249 employees) it was Mundipharma Medical Company which focuses on biotech and pharmaceuticals. Rackspace International, an IT firm specializing in storage and data management, topped the list for firms with 20-49 employees.


“The best employers in Switzerland are distinguished by a respectful and motivational workplace culture,” said Great Place to Work in a statement. “If 84% of employees rate their employer positively and then are also willing to make every effort for this company, then this is a key condition for the success of a company.”


It noted however that Swiss employees expectations of their employers were very high.


Relationship


“The good relationship with our employees is as important for the overall picture as our products and client relations,” said Athanasios Zikopoulos, General Manager at Mundipharma Medical Company, in the statement.


“So we are considered as a particularly good employer on the jobs market, which is not only good for our reputation, but also positively affects retention and recruitment.”


Among the large companies lower-paying firms like Ikea and McDonalds were in the top five. This is not a surprise for Michael Hermann, CEO of Great Place to Work Switzerland. He told the 20 Minutes freesheet that working conditions and perspectives were considered more important than pay.


No indications are made which companies did not do well in the survey.


Gender Gap


The Gender Gap is however present in all companies, even the best-scoring ones, Great Place to Work Switzerland said. Both men and women tended to rate their companies in a similar way overall. But pay was a key factor. Although the survey cannot say whether there is a gender pay gap, the results showed that there was a perceived one among workers.


More men (71%) than women (52%) said that they felt pay was fair. In addition, fewer women (75%) than men (85%) felt that they were able to take time off when needed.


Hermann said that the difference over pay came from the difficult in combining both work and family. “In Switzerland, women in particular often have to choose between children and a career.”  Other countries are further ahead, especially in Scandinavia, where the perceived difference over fairness in pay was a lot smaller, he said. × Related Stories Internet growth Google expands in Zurich but tax structure remains unclear By Simon Bradley Internet giant Google is extending its presence in Zurich.

I put the projections for potential draftees in a Google Doc. I used data from RealGM to model career averages of BPM/RAPM/BBPM as well as 3 point shooting and FTA/40. R squares are presented at the bottom of sheet 1. I also calculated the predictions for some of the previous years top prospects, on the 2nd tab of the Google doc. To see how the predictions did in previous years. The models seem to favor older two way players, which makes sense since these players usually put up better overall numbers. The top previous freshman prospect that I looked at was Noel, who the models would've predicted to be a defensive guru and a negative offensive player. Simmons was the top projected 2-way freshman prospect. It also accurately predicted Okafor and Bennett to be negative 0-way players (although not to the extreme that they are). So I feel the modeling is fairly strong. Now on to the results for this years prospects. The upperclassman (aka 2nd round and trade up targets): Donovan Mitchell, Sindarius Thornwell, Josh Hart, and Nigel Williams-Goss. All of these players are projected to be positive players. Mitchell and Thornwell are both predicted to be potential 2-way players. While, Hart and Williams-Goss are both predicted to be good offensive players with passable defense. Mitchell specifically seems like a perfect fit as a 3&D type PG with a projected 44% 3 point shot (the model is generous) and would be an the ideal target in a draft day trade up. 2-way Freshman Studs: Lonzo Ball, Jonathan Isaac, Josh Jackson, and Jayson Tatum are all projected to be 2-way players. With Isaac in addition being a great defender, Lonzo being a great offensive player. While, Jackson and Tatum are simply adequate on both ends. Lonzo, specifically, is projected as the best player in the draft, but the 42% 3 pointer is probably extremely generous as the model can't factor in Lonzo's poor shot form. Lonzo is however still projected to have a horrible FTA/40 with the lowest such rate in the entire prospect pool. 1-way Freshman Studs: Markelle Futlz, Dennis Smith Jr., and Zach Collins are all projected to be great on one-side of the ball and passable on the other. Fultz and Smith on offense, while Collins on defense. The 3 point % on Fultz and Collins both seem a little bit low at 32% and 21% respectively so its possible that they are both better than projected by having an improved shot. Fultz's and Smith's defense are of course also things should be much better if they put more effort in. 0-way Players: There are three potential lottery players in this category. John Collins, TJ Leaf, and D'Aaron Fox. Fox and Collins are both projected to be pretty staunchly negative defenders, which goes contrary to the belief of scouts. There is potential for them to be net-0 players on offense so at least there's that. TJ Leaf is projected to be pretty horrible at everything. Other surprises: Justin Jackson's projected 46% 3 point shooting, but also horrible defense. Very few really bad players in this draft class. With the exception of Leaf everyone seems to have the potential to be able to play at least 1 side of the ball. Especially when you consider these same models had the last two 3rd overall picks as 0-way players. Let me know your thoughts, or if you want me to add anyone else. I will attempt to do a follow up with European prospects at some point (although the sample is much smaller). A user-created LB joint. The Liberty Ballers staff does not contribute to FanPosts.

Karl Stoddart, from Gateshead, used his mobile phone to “Google” the name of the defendant whose case he was trying at Newcastle Crown Court in July 2014. His curiosity was a direct breach of a barrage of warnings forbidding such freelance research by jurors, London’s High Court heard. The 29-year-old chef admitted contempt of court but said his internet search played no part in the jury’s deliberations. The man whose case he was trying, Paul Quinn, in his 50s, of Hertburn Gardens, Washington, was convicted of burglary. But Mr Quinn later challenged the verdict after Mr Stoddart’s conduct emerged and his conviction was overturned by the Court of Appeal. He was due to be re-tried, but Mr Quinn was finally cleared when the case against him was dropped due to “unrelated matters”, explained Sir Brian Leveson today. Lawyers for the Solicitor General, Robert Buckland QC, applied for Mr Stoddart’s committal to prison for contempt. Sir Brian, sitting with Mr Justice Blake and Mr Justice Lewis, highlighted the £10,000 to £15,000 cost involved in investigating the contempt. All 12 trial jurors had to be interviewed and, in such cases of juror misbehaviour, a spell behind bars was “virtually inevitable”, he stressed. It was still unclear exactly what drove the normally law-abiding chef and family man to obey such direct orders in relation to behaviour of jurors, the court heard.

Posters in the jury waiting room echoed the same warnings, the court heard, while the trial judge had also spelt it out at the start of the case. The court heard Mr Stoddart had “very little explanation other than that he sought to satisfy his curiosity”. The judge told Stoddart: “I am not going to send you to prison today”.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going — we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully be fixed before the KEYone is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55μm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design, the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used — I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish feels like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone — I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like — I just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see it every time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you — I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player — rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations — Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there — I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot quite hold its own next to the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing. Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades — you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84° wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up — this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone.   Nipping at the heels of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you.   DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or you can have it inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know when something accesses my calendar or to notify me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this — I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look — you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup.    The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options — I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything.   If you're super paranoid about people peering over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher — all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone — not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything with a production model when the phone is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even though it is a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting — honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it (I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do. It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me — I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...😉 Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. freshprince_87 Yep. Makes all the difference Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It´s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you?

The Google Home has a built-in library of relaxing ambient audio Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:26am PDTMay 6, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 56 Share on Facebook 55 Share on Twitter Total Shares148 Google Home Videos Update 1: 2017/05/06 10:12am PDT While Google's support page says the feature is limited to Google Homes in United States, there are reports of it working outside 'Murica as well. Feeling like you want to relax after you've finished that meal you prepared with Google Home's help? Overwhelmed by your Home's answer to what's on your schedule tomorrow? Just ask it to help you relax with some soothing ambient sounds. Currently offering a catalog of 15 different ambient sound themes, Google Home can now replace your sound machine. The ambient sound themes include nature sounds, water sounds, fireplace sounds, and country sounds. The latter of those is crickets, lots of crickets. The ocean sounds theme must be based on heavy seas because I found that one a little too stimulating. If you're feeling lucky (that's Google Play Music lingo), you can just say, "Help me relax," and your Google Home will select a theme for you. Do you want to fall asleep to relaxing sounds? No problem. You can tell your Google Home to play one of these relaxing themes for a specified amount of time. For example, you can say, "Hey Google, play forest sounds for two hours." You'll hear the sounds of the forest for two hours, and then your Home will slowly fade out the audio. If you don't specify a time limit, it will default to one hour. Google has even included this helpful video on their support page. Let Tech With Brett take it away. Google notes that you can press and hold your finger on the top of the device to activate your Google Home instead of speaking the wake word. I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme. If you are going to talk to your Home anyway, you might as well wake it with your voice too. I can already imagine combining these sounds with Hue lighting scenes to create my own voice activated relaxation chamber.

What is their excuse now? Tiuri Elvander The Home isn't even available outside of the US (and the UK), so it's not like many people will miss out :( Alex Since the Google Home has launched in the UK, every new feature for it (multi user, recipes, etc) has not. The week after it launched, Google changed the shopping list feature to use a service that also hasn't launched in the UK. It also still cannot do any 'skills', meaning that it's basically just a chromecast speaker and a kitchen timer. I'm very glad that SOMEONE at Google cares about Google Home for them to have rolled out a number of updates to it over the past few weeks, but as someone who dropped £130 on it expecting it - from reviews of the American version - to be better than the Amazon Echo, the constant stream of "HERE'S NEW STUFF - BUT NOT FOR YOU" is getting pretty tiresome. NooSH first off all , you should already know that by now so your whining is getting as tiresome as what your'e crying about.. second: maybe blame your own country for that?, pretty sure if every country didn't have international restrictions and laws when it comes to tech, everyone would have everything.. google makes money , that's their job, pretty sure they would want to make as much as possible.. it's like you blaming a clerk for not having a certain item in store. -_- Lars Jeppesen So it is for legal reasons, according to you, that multi user is not available outside the US? Nicholas Conrad I think he just wants to believe in a silver lining to brexit. Lars Jeppesen LOL Alex I've literally never posted on this site about this before ever. You must have an incredibly low threshold for getting tired. I'm also pretty certain there are no laws stopping Google from making some forest noises for the UK, or ensuring that their product can do at a bare minimum what their direct competitor can in the country. What I'm blaming is Google, the developers of the product, from not supporting that product in a country they have released said product in. Nicholas Conrad Do you even KNOW how long the us had to wait for crappy 'BBC America' to drop episodes​ of Downton Abbey?? Months! Months after they aired in gb. We live in the internet age, how the crap do you avoid spoilers for *months*? You can't, that's how! Get your shit together and then maybe, just maybe we'll let you have ambient sounds. Alex I'm... sorry? I guess I'll get right onto ITV and ask them why an American company using the BBC's name didn't show a terrible programme sooner? If I do that, will you get Google to stop being shit about supporting their own product? Lars Jeppesen And we're quite a lot of people who imported the GH - some of us do travel. :) I'm seriously pissed and baffled about why a function like this is only available to the US market.. what's the reason? There must be something.. I don't have multi user either, seriously pissed about it.. why Google, why? Edit: I was prematurely pissed - the relax sounds actually works for me (I'm in Denmark, Europe) Nicholas Conrad Why aren't you NATing it and using a stateside proxy server then? Lars Jeppesen I tried using a VPN bit didn't work.. maybe I need to set it up from scratch again Nicholas Conrad Hmm, is your language setting set to us english?

Lars Jeppesen Hhmm it works for me and I'm in Denmark Zsolt V I don't know but rest assured there is a reason. It's not like some PM says, let's not launch in the UK because they still have a queen. ericshmerick This is awesome since one of my Google Home's is on my bedside table. I just wish there was a way to have separate volume settings for media (this) and alarms. When falling asleep to these ambient sounds, I'll probably have the volume at ~30%. I prefer the alarm volume to be at ~70%. There isn't a way to change it after I've fallen asleep since the 30% setting preserves. One day I guess. jstew182 This is the feature I would like most too come to Home. I wish the voice response could be set to a different level as well rather than default to the same level as everything else. I don't need her yelling at me in the middle of the night if I ask her to change to nest temp or to turn off my fan. WretchedGenius You can do that. In your Google Home app, go to your list of devices. Go into the settings for the device you want to control. Under settings there is a category for Alarms & Timers that lets you set a specific volume that is distinct from the normal device volume. ericshmerick Nice, thanks! 😆😄 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/732f2199e4eb5e261095d689c87fe28733f8387ee06831dc2198fb9655728479.png TheScientists "I'm not sure what the advantage of this is because you still need to speak your request to play an ambient sound theme." The advantage is that you don't have your phone, tablet, watch, toaster, etc all going off at the same time fighting over who gets to answer the Ok Google request. Paul Quinn The whole point of these home assistants is not having to go physically touch them to use them. I assume that most people have figured out a way to avoid activating multiple devices to use their Home. "Hey Google" is a good way to avoid activating phones and tablets. The multiple activations issue does need to be addressed though. Andrew Palmer Works on my UK Home Lars Jeppesen Ditto for me (Denmark) Willie Chalmers III "The Google Home"? That just sounds odd.

Tech Search Search Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Berkshire Hathaway Stock May Start Paying Dividends Warren BuffettWarren Buffett Says Artificial Intelligence Will ‘Hurt’ Berkshire Hathaway’s Business Berkshire Hathaway 2017Warren Buffett: Not Buying Google Is Berkshire Hathaway’s Biggest Mistake Kentucky DerbyHow to Bet on the Kentucky Derby Online Cyber Saturday Data Sheet—Saturday, May 6, 2017 Robert Hackett May 06, 2017 Enough is enough. This week's giant Google Docs phishing attack, which led to the compromise of millions of Gmail accounts is a wake-up call that we need a solution to the hacking epidemic. And I think I have one. First, though, let's recap what happened: A canny hacker sent an email saying a contact wanted them to view a Google Docs document. People who clicked on a "Open in Docs" link were then asked for access to their account. The whole thing looked pretty convincing, and a lot of people fell for it (ThreatPost has a full breakdown of all the details). And while Google quickly took steps to mitigate the attack, the hackers were able to access a large number of accounts. In the wake of this, it's tempting to do one of two things: blame Google for allowing this to happen, or shake your head at those poor fools who didn't know any better and clicked the link. Both responses are reasonable. As SwiftonSecurity notes, an oversight by Google helped the hacker make the scam look convincing. But at the same time, the attack was suspicious enough that those with a passing knowledge of phishing and computer security knew enough to stay away. But such finger pointing won't do anything to avoid the next big phishing attack, which will no doubt be zipping around the Internet before long. Instead, the solution I propose is a life-skills style education campaign aimed at high school students, and then at everyone else. I asked my partner, who is an educator in a New York City school, if such a thing exists. To my surprise, she said no. Instead, computer education is aimed at those who already have a passion for computers (and would be the least likely to fall for a phishing scheme.) There is no computer safety course for the general student population. Nor, as far as I know, is there such a thing for colleges or entry level jobs. And this is my point. Just as schools help young people to read maps or make a budget or cook or sew, it's time for them to explain the Internet's architecture and where the dangers lie. A decade ago, it was enough to warn kids about creeps on Craigslist. These days, the threats are infinitely more subtle, and the time has come to train kids to avoid them. Hacking is now a public safety issue. We should respond accordingly.

You may reach Robert Hackett via Twitter, Cryptocat, Jabber (see OTR fingerprint on my about.me), PGP encrypted email (see public key on my Keybase.io), Wickr, Signal, or however you (securely) prefer. Feedback welcome. THREATS Le hackers meddle with Macron. Just two days before France votes for a new President, the campaign of frontrunner Emmanuel Macron has been hit with a "massive and coordinated" hacking attack. The hackers reportedly duped campaign staff with phishing attempts and fake websites, and have now dumped reams of emails and accounting statements onto the Internet. Once again, it appears Russia is behind the attacks, seeking to disrupt and destabilize another democracy. (New York Times) So long security blanket. 2FA is compromised. We've long talked up the virtues of two-factor authentication (2FA) as an easy and effective way to keep the hackers out. Looks like we spoke too soon. In recent months, hackers figured out a way around 2FA via a vulnerability in a mobile data protocol used for cell phone roaming. The upshot is that criminals are getting hold of SMS codes—which serve as the second factor in many 2FA system—and draining bank accounts. It's unclear how or when banks and Internet companies will address this. (Ars Technica) Censorship in the age of Facebook: Fears over online censorship typically turn on autocrats shutting down the Internet. But now governments don't even have to do that because they can rely on a new and more subtle tactic: Drowning dissidents out with distraction and fake information. That's one of the big ideas shared by noted tech scholars Zeynep Tufekci and Tim Wu, who talked about the future of the networked world during a First Amendment event at Columbia University. (Fortune) It's not just Chipotle. The data breach reported at down-on-its-luck Chipotle appears to be part of a systemic campaign to phish U.S. restaurant chains and bilk them with fake invoices. The campaign is reportedly being run by a sophisticated Eastern European gang and has successfully hacked more than 20 U.S.-based hospitality companies, using booby-trapped attachments to install malware. Samples of the malware suggest victims may also include Ruby Tuesdays and Baja Fresh. (CyberScoop) The Dark Overlord lacks people skills. What a surprise—the hacker who goes by "The Dark Overlord," who last week published stolen Netflix shows, comes across a juvenile, publicity-hungry jerk in a profile piece. '"You'll be publishing something?' The Dark Overlord incessantly asked," according to the profile.

ACCESS GRANTED I don't usually laugh when I read Fortune, but this Q&A about ICOs ("Initial Coin Offerings") is hilarious—and damn helpful too. In it, my colleague Robert Hackett breaks down the finer points of blockchain and digital currency to Erin Griffith, who writes Term Sheet. Fin-tech insiders will chuckle (really) as Erin gets her head around ICOs, while normal folks will learn useful things about one of the hottest niches in finance. EG: So, why would a company want its stock to be made up of cryptocurrency rather than real money currency? RH: "Real" money? HAVE I TAUGHT YOU NOTHING. EG: Okay! Why would a company want its stock to be made up of cryptocurrency rather than fiat currency? Read more on Fortune.com.

With no official word from Google about these changes, we just figured that Google was refreshing and adding to the images made available to users. Shortly after, Google has pushed out another server-side update that has added two new wallpaper categories: Art and Solid Colors. UAG Samsung Galaxy S8 Cases These two new wallpaper categories are pretty self-explanatory. The Art category showcases dozens of different pieces that appear to focus on nature, geometric shapes, and other abstract imagery. What’s nice is that when viewing the individual wallpapers within the app, you can tap on each image to see the piece’s name, the creator, or click on the “explore” button to learn more about the item. The Solid Colors category is the perfect companion for anyone who just likes to keep their phone as simple and minimalist as possible. With this wallpaper pack selected, you will receive a new solid color wallpaper every day. These range from all of your standard colors (red, blue, green, etc.) to different shades and variations of the entire color palette. If you haven’t yet, make sure to head on over to the Play Store and download Google Wallpapers. It’s free and it will automatically change your phone’s background daily with a high-quality image from one of the categories found within the app if you choose to do so.

Apple, Google, and Facebook have done so—possibly more than any other upstart companies in recent U.S. history. These now-mature businesses are grappling with how their world-changing ventures have broadly affected the economy and communications. And in the prevailing populist mood, the American public may be more inclined to hold these mega-firms responsible for less than desirable outcomes—fairly or not. All three tech giants came under the spotlight this week, facing different issues of public concern. —–Apple CEO Timothy Cook surprised CNBC “Mad Money” host Jim Cramer by announcing on the show Wednesday that Apple plans to devote $1 billion to a fund supporting the development of advanced manufacturing capabilities in the United States. The new initiative addresses a sore spot in the narrative of Apple’s meteoric rise—the charge that it sends its manufacturing jobs to China and other locations where wages are much lower and working conditions are suspect. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump called Apple out for exporting jobs, and a Bloomberg feature last week focused on a huge iPhone manufacturing plant in Shanghai, where Apple maintains it has curbed alleged use of excessive overtime. But a watchdog group cited in the story, China Labor Watch, says workers must still work overtime just to meet their living expenses. With his sudden announcement this week, Cook didn’t promise to spend part of Apple’s new $1 billion fund to build iPhone factories in the United States. But the CEO said Apple will help create high-tech manufacturing jobs here, and hinted at the method. He said Apple is in talks to invest in an unnamed company, and may make an announcement about it later this month, according to CNBC’s write-up of the interview with Cramer. “A lot of people ask me, ‘Do you think it’s a company’s job to create jobs?’ and my response is [that] a company should have values because a company is a collection of people,” CNBC quotes Cook from the interview. “And people should have values, so by extension, a company should. And one of the things you do is give back,” Cook said. “So how do you give back? We give back through our work in the environment, in running the company on renewable energy. We give back in job creation.” Apple, with 80,000 U.S. employees, says it has already given rise to a total of two million jobs in the United States. It makes this case on a company website that now includes a state-by-state breakdown of the number of its staff members, stores, and suppliers, who make their own hires. The Apple employee count just unveiled ranges from its 36,786 workers in California to its four in North Dakota. Austin, TX, has 6,000 Apple employees, the company’s second-largest complement in the world. Apple also takes credit for 1.5 million jobs arising from its “App store ecosystem.” That would include app developers, but also non-tech staffers such as restaurant workers who benefit from the spending related to apps, as Associated Press reporters Michael Liedtke and Christopher Rugaber wrote in a story about Apple’s increasing drive to showcase its contributions to the American economy. In the AP story, Diane Swonk, CEO of DS Economics, says Apple is stretching its app ecosystem job claims too far. —Facebook has built a virtual community of almost two billion people, serving as a digital mailbox, a bulletin board, a TV station, and a news outlet of commanding reach. But in addition to sharing positive content—- from family milestones to important policy discussions—-Facebook has unintentionally broadcast live murders on video, fake news about political candidates, and stolen photos of undressed women Marines. On Wednesday, Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg accepted broader responsibility to regulate criminal and offensive behavior in the online community by pledging to add 3,000 more staffers to a global community operations team of 4,500. “Over the last few weeks, we’ve seen people hurting themselves and others on Facebook—either live or in video posted later,” Zuckerberg wrote in a company blog post. “It’s heartbreaking, and I’ve been reflecting on how we can do better for our community. If we’re going to build a safe community, we need to respond quickly.” The surveillance obligations Zuckerberg describes go beyond taking down things like racist and violent videos from the site. They also extend to coordinating with outside agencies to change real-world outcomes. “We’ll keep working with local community groups and law enforcement who are in the best position to help someone if they need it—either because they’re about to harm themselves, or because they’re in danger from someone else,” Zuckerberg wrote. The obligation to patrol the communications of billions of people is daunting, although artificial intelligence technologies could provide a big assist, Zuckerberg has said. But even expert human lawyers could have a hard time drawing up reliable rules that would banish a murder filmed by the killer, but keep video of the police shooting of a suspect available on the site because it informs the public about the actions of its government. Even subtler are the distinctions between fair comment protected by the First Amendment and an offense such as libel or cyberbullying. Beyond those dilemmas, though, Facebook has been accused of creating new kinds of societal jeopardy with algorithms that detect user preferences and feed back similar content to those users that may confirm their biases, or simply insulate them from a broader view of the world. It’s a problem that bright programmers might have a good time tackling. —Google, a perennial target of hackers because people conduct so much of their lives and work through its e-mail and other services, reacted to a big breach of its defenses this week. One of Google’s Twitter accounts, @googledocs, sent out a brief alert at 1:08 pm Wednesday: “We are investigating a phishing email that appears as Google Docs. We encourage you to not click through & report as phishing within Gmail.” As Recode described the situation in a headline three hours later: “A massive Google Docs hack is spreading like wildfire” Hackers impersonating Google Docs had sent deceptive e-mails inviting victims to look at a Google Doc allegedly shared with them by people or organizations the targets knew. The unfortunates who clicked through the scam messages opened their entire Google accounts to the bad guys, who could then re-broadcast the malicious message to all the victims’ contacts. John Wilson, field CTO at cybersecurity company Agari, wrote in an analysis that the hack was very effective because it didn’t use malware or other methods that would be picked up by cybersecurity defenses. “While we haven’t seen reports of fraud yet, the cybercriminals who launched the attack have access to all of the victims’ emails until the app is disabled,” Wilson wrote. “With that access, the criminals can use your identity to scam co-workers or relatives, reset your bank account password and steal money or harvest information to steal the victim’s identity. There are an infinite number of ways a cybercriminal can monetize this kind of access.” Google sent word via Twitter by 3:20 pm that it had removed the fake pages and malicious accounts used in the attack. Then it responded to the flood of tweets—–like a chorus of digital wails—from people who had fallen for the spoofing scam and clicked. The company tweeted out an address to go to for help deleting the app still controlling the victims’ data. Among the responses to Google’s advice was a particularly poignant tweet from @ladyaeva. “how do we know you’re the real google doctors,” she wrote.

Alex Cranz | Gawker MediaMay 6, 2017, 07.19 PM IST FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedinReddit windows 10Image Credit Continue reading Image: Gizmodo It has been nearly two years since Microsoft introduced a new Windows phone. Sure, HP is still making Windows phones and marketing them to businesses, but Microsoft has been basically silent on the subject of its flagging mobile platform since 2015. There have been zero flagship devices, despite the persistent rumors of a super Surface phone . Logic dictates that Microsoft needs to get in the game here. People are increasingly moving away from their laptops and onto their smartphones, and if Microsoft wants to keep up with Apple and Google, it will need a convincing phone platform. Advertisement The company apparently has something in the works. According to Windows Central , Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella confirmed as much on the Marketplace podcast Make Me Smart earlier this week. "I'm sure we'll make more phones," Nadella told host Molly Wood, "but they will not look like phones that are there today." Advertisement Let's step back for a moment. Windows 10 on a phone today has two things going for it. First, the interface is gorgeous-sleek and minimalist, without any of the cutesy affectations that iOS and Android have collected over the years. Second, the phones function as mini PCs thanks to Continuum, so you can phone during the day and then dock it at your monitor and keyboard for a traditional PC experience at night. But the current version of Windows on mobile phones, Windows 10 Mobile, was introduced waaaaaay back in 2015 alongside Microsoft's last flagship, the Lumia 950 . (You'll recall that Microsoft took over the Lumia brand from old Windows Phone stalwart Nokia in 2013.) It's no surprise the next flagship is slow to appear. Windows for a phone was already late to the scene when Microsoft launched Windows Phone 7 in 2010. By then, Apple was a powerhouse with the iPhone, and Google had forged a worthy competitor with great Android devices like the Motorola Droid. But Microsoft's mobile look was so radically cool, it conceivably had a chance to be a true contender. At the time, even Gizmodo was enraptured . "Everything's different now," we wrote. Sponsored In a way that proved very true. Only instead of radically disrupting the mobile phone market, Microsoft saw itself playing a distant third fiddle to the titans, Apple and Google. Everything really was different. Microsoft was accustomed to making the best-selling OS, and its failure to find its way into the lucrative mobile market left Microsoft scrambling. First there was the massive Windows 8 redesign that spanned mobile and desktop devices. Then Cortana came in 8.1, giving Windows phones a digital assistant to rival Siri. In 2015, Microsoft introduced Continuum, which let phone users plug their devices into a monitor and keyboard and get a Windows experience similar to the one enjoyed by desktop users. But as cool as Microsoft's attempts at competing have been, the company has failed to break into the elite mobile OS inner ring. By the time it arrived, users had already bought into the Android and iOS ecosystems, and developers, who were already building apps for two mobile operating systems, had little desire to add a third, far less lucrative one to their roadmaps. Sure, the many iterations of Windows for phones looked nice enough, and had the backing of Microsoft, but its constant game of catch up with Apple and Google made the phones built for the platforms unappealing. "There's just no reason to choose a pricey Windows handset when Google and Apple offer way better options," Gizmodo's Mario Aguilar said back in 2015. That hasn't changed, and it's one of the reasons why, just last month , Android overtook Windows as the most installed OS in the world, according to one estimation. Advertisement Advertisement Hopefully, this two-year-long news void in the mobile phone market is the result of Microsoft working like hell to make something new. Microsoft can't gain a measurable share of the smartphone market (and thus interest from app developers) without first making a product consumers really want to buy, and it can't do that without wildly wowing us with hardware radically different than what the likes of Apple and Samsung currently provide. As we noted last year, smartphones have become universally so good they're boring , and they're also so expensive now, that people are moving away from the two-year purchase cycle. Microsoft not only has to make a great phone, it has to be a disruptive one-and there's no clear path to such a device apparent in the stable of phones on the market. In other words, Microsoft needs to blow our collective minds. Advertisement So what would a future Windows phone look like? Ahead of Microsoft's hardware event last week, we might have hoped for a cloud-based phone, but that dream was shuttered when the long-rumored Windows 10 Cloud was officially named Windows 10 S . Instead of being a window into the cloud computing future, Windows 10 S resembles lightweight Windows variations like Windows RT and Windows 8.1 with Bing. It's not cloud-based, but rooted in the computer and inextricably linked to Windows' wasteland of an app Store. And that Store isn't going to just improve overnight. As already noted, Microsoft needs a robust stable of developers in order to bring in mobile users, but developers want a large user base before they dedicate time and money to a platform. So Microsoft is left at a frustratingly cyclical impasse. Which means whatever we see is going to have to be so different, so wild, that neither developers nor consumers will care. Get cracking Microsoft. We're ready for that Surface Phone.

The weekend has arrived once more, and that means it’s time to pause and catch our breaths, as we look back on another exciting week across the tech world. There were some major announcements, a few juicy rumors, and one or two surprises – and as ever, 7 Days is here to make sure you know exactly what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in China, where authorities are apparently preparing to launch an alternative to Wikipedia, bringing together "the biggest, most high-quality author team" in the world. Underneath the obnoxiously large watermark in the image above, you'll see Fitbit's new smartwatch, which was revealed in leaked pictures alongside a new set of Bluetooth earbuds. Qualcomm is reportedly preparing to ask the International Trade Commission to enforce an import ban on iPhones entering the United States. Apple recently stopped paying royalties to some of Qualcomm's partners in China, amid a bitter dispute between the two companies over Qualcomm's licensing fees. Next week, Qualcomm will announce details of its new Snapdragon 660 processor chipset Mobile Platform for upper-mid-range devices. Rival chipmaker Intel finally patched a security vulnerability that has existed in some of its products for almost a decade. An email phishing scam attempted to ensnare users by linking to a shared Google Docs file, which routed users through a legitimate Google sign-in page, before a fake app requested authorization to access their emails. Meanwhile, Google made changes to Gmail's security warnings to offer greater protection against phishing attempts. O2, part of Spanish telecommunications giant Telefónica, revealed that some of its customers had had their bank accounts accessed by unknown third parties, as the result of a phishing attack combined with a known flaw in the SS7 protocol. A hacker, going by the name 'The Dark Overlord', leaked episodes of the upcoming season of hit Netflix show Orange Is The New Black, after the company ignored demands for a ransom payment. The same hacker claims to have possession of a further 36 unreleased movies and TV shows, and has again threatened to release them online unless a payment is made. Netflix content can now be viewed in 4K via the Microsoft Edge browser or the official Netflix app on Windows 10, thanks to a new preview driver from Nvidia for its GeForce GTX 10xx-series graphics cards. Samsung is hoping to attract more buyers to its Galaxy S8 flagships by offering them a free six-month Netflix subscription, 64GB microSD EVO+ card, and a Clear View Standing Cover. Samsung began rolling out a software fix for red-tinted displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ in Europe, and on T-Mobile in the US, but another issue popped up this week, causing some of those devices to randomly reboot. Buyers of LG's new G6 on T-Mobile can now get the device with $150 off, along with a free Google Home speaker and an LG G Pad X 8.0 tablet. LG is reportedly working on a 'G6 mini', which could prove popular among those who prefer a more compact flagship. HTC won't officially unveil its new U 11 flagship until later this month - but thanks to a leak, it seems we now know all of its key specs. OnePlus confirmed that its new Android flagship (gosh, there sure are a lot of flagships these days...) will be called the OnePlus 5, and will launch this summer. The company is skipping over the 'OnePlus 4' moniker as that number is considered unlucky in Chinese culture. Google published its latest breakdown of Android usage, revealing that just 0.5% of active devices are running the latest Android release, version 7.1. Android 7.0 is now up to just 6.6%, almost nine months after its rollout began. That long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge and S6 active on AT&T Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ on T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy A5 (2016) Honor 6X Google released its latest monthly Android security update, and published new factory and OTA images for its supported Nexus and Pixel devices. Details emerged of a new Android tablet in development by Motorola, with a 'premium look and feel', cellular connectivity, and a 'productivity mode', enabling users to pin apps to the nav bar. With Google's latest update to Chrome on Windows, version 58.0.3029.96, users with a 64-bit version of the OS running a 32-bit version of the browser will be automatically migrated to the 64-bit browser, if they have auto-update enabled. Google is getting ready to launch a major redesign of YouTube, including support for a dark theme - and it's got some big names onboard to support its stylish new look. Google and The Raspberry Pi Foundation teamed up to offer a low-cost cardboard kit that makers can use to build their own version of Google Home, including voice control support through the Google Assistant SDK. We've known since November that Amazon is working on a new Echo device, powered by its Alexa digital assistant, featuring a touchscreen and improved speakers - and the first images of that device appeared on Friday. Apple will reportedly unveil its own high-end rival to the Amazon Echo at its Worldwide Developer Conference next month. The new voice-controlled speaker is said to have a cylindrical design, similar to that of the Mac Pro, and - unsurprisingly - will support Apple's Siri digital assistant. Apple published its latest earnings report, revealing details of a very strong quarter for its services business, but a slight decline in iPhone sales, and a big drop in iPad sales. Apple promised to invest $1 billion in US manufacturing, and claimed that it's responsible for creating two million jobs across the country, despite only employing 80,000 people. Kensington released a new fingerprint scanner for PCs, priced at $50. The VeriMark sensor connects to a device via a USB port, and supports Windows Hello and FIDO. Toshiba's new Portégé X30 is a Windows 10 notebook that also supports Windows Hello biometric authentication, and promises enterprise-class security through a range of features, including TPM 2.0, BitLocker Drive Encryption, a Smart Card reader, and more, priced from $1,449. You don't need to spend a fortune to get Windows Hello support, though. The ASUS Transformer Mini is a 10.1-inch Windows 10 tablet that weighs just 790g with the keyboard attached, and has 4GB RAM, 64GB storage, and a kickstand similar to Microsoft's Surface tablets. The best bit is the price: it's now available in the US for just $249, including the keyboard and pen. Microsoft is offering some big discounts on its Surface products in the UK. All Surface Pro 4 models are now available with up to 19% off, while Surface Book i7 models (excluding those with the new Performance Base) can now be purchased with up to £665 off, along with free Bowers & Wilkins headphones worth £119.99. Microsoft also introduced its new Surface Arc Mouse, priced at $79.99, and available in three colors. Two of the Arc Mouse colors match those of the new Surface Laptop, which Microsoft unveiled on Tuesday at an education-focused event in New York City. Unlike previous Surface devices, the Laptop isn't attempting to define a new product category - beneath its (very!) pretty design, it's a surprisingly ordinary notebook, with its only truly distinguishing feature being the Alcantara fabric trim applied to its keyboard area. And while it has a touchscreen, and supports the Surface Pen, the display can't even be pushed back 180-degrees, so if you want to write on its screen, you'll have to do something like this: Here it is. RT @SurfaceProArt @thurrott From a reader at TabletPCReview forums. pic.twitter.com/1f8a71oNth — Paul Thurrott (@thurrott) May 4, 2017 The Surface Laptop certainly has premium pricing to match its premium styling - the entry-level model, which has just 4GB of RAM, and a 128GB SSD, costs $999, or £979 in the UK. For unexplained reasons, the four color options are only available on one model - the Core i5 version with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD; but in the UK, and other markets, only the silver ("Platinum") color is offered across the entire range. And even though you could be paying up to $2,199 for the range-topping model, you'll still have limited connectivity options: you'll only get one USB 3.0 Type-A port, a Mini DisplayPort, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. There's no microSD slot, and no USB-C support either, even though one of Microsoft's own promotional videos showed a Surface Laptop prototype with two USB Type-C ports. Check out our hands-on first impressions of the Surface Laptop to find out more. The Surface Laptop is also the first device to come with the new Windows 10 S edition, previously known as 'Windows 10 Cloud'. Windows 10 S only allows apps to be installed from the Windows Store, offering more security on devices, and limiting the impact of malware and viruses. It should also deliver better battery performance, thanks to restrictions on background tasks and services for apps installed from the Store. It will also prevent users from changing the default browser (Edge) and search engine (Bing). Windows 10 S is primarily intended for the education market, but it still comes pre-installed on the Surface Laptop for consumers, although Microsoft is offering a free upgrade to Windows 10 Pro for those who buy the device until the end of the year. Anyone else who wants to upgrade a device that comes with Windows 10 S to the Pro edition will have to pay around $49 to do so. Since Windows 10 S devices can only run apps from the Windows Store, Microsoft also announced that its Office 365 desktop applications are also "coming soon" to the Store. Spotify is coming to the Windows Store as well - but as it will be a simple Desktop Bridge 'conversion' of its existing desktop app, it will only be available for Windows 10 PCs, and not for other devices like phones or the Xbox One. Cloud storage service MEGA will soon launch an app in the Windows Store too, built on Microsoft's Universal Windows Platform, and available on PCs and phones. By the way, Microsoft has another launch event coming up later this month. The company revealed on Thursday that it "will show the world what's next" at an event in Shanghai on May 23, where it's likely to unveil its new Surface Pro 5. Last weekend, Neowin exclusively revealed that Microsoft is planning to separate development of its Edge web browser from Windows 10 when it releases its next major update to the OS in September. The Windows 10 Creators Update, which is currently rolling out to consumers, is the most recent such update for the OS. This week, Microsoft detailed some of the improvements to Edge that that update includes for IT pros and enterprise admins. Meanwhile, Edge's share of the desktop browser market remains stagnant, while Chrome has increased its share to 63.45% since last month. Microsoft brought its Focused Inbox feature to Outlook 2016, making it available to all users in the Office 365 First Release program - a big step towards rolling it out for everyone. The company also released a new Outlook for Mac Insider Preview to the Fast ring, and finally added Outlook to its Office Insider Program on iOS. Microsoft Teams - the firm's "chat-based workspace" app for Office 365 - got a big update with some handy new features on iOS and Windows 10 Mobile. Last week, when Microsoft published its quarterly earnings report, I pointed out that its phone hardware business is now dead, with negligible revenue, and no new devices coming anytime soon. But Microsoft Technical Fellow Alex Kipman went even further this week, effectively declaring that the era of the smartphone is over: "The phone is already dead," he said. "People just haven't realized." Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella had a slightly different take on things, saying: "I'm sure we will make more phones, but they will not look like phones that are there today." Could he be referring to Westworld-style foldable phones? Well... we can dream - but it's probably best not to get your hopes up. Microsoft is continuing to work on Windows 10 Mobile in a separate 'feature2' branch, having split its development from the main Redstone 3 (RS3) branch a few weeks ago. It released a new Windows 10 Mobile Insider Preview, build 15210, to the Fast ring on Wednesday. On the same day, Windows 10 build 16188 rolled out to PCs in the Fast ring from the RS3 branch, bringing a range of additions and improvements, including a new Cortana section in the Settings app, new Edge PDF Reader functionality, a better update experience, and more. The fixes and known issues for that build can be found here. It seems clear that Windows 10 development for PCs is currently proceeding at a far greater pace than for phones. Windows 10 has apparently reached a plateau on Valve's Steam gaming platform, after hitting an all-time high of 51.2% of gamers there last month. Valve announced an overhaul of its gifting system, and revealed a range of improvements to its customer support system. Xbox chief Phil Spencer said he believes that Microsoft's first-party studios should be "a beacon of innovation for how our platform is being used". He cited Gears of War 4 as an example of this, with its introduction of cross-play between Xbox One consoles and Windows 10 PCs. Gears of War 4 got its latest update this week, with two new maps, multi-GPU support on Windows 10 PCs, and more. Microsoft added five more Xbox 360 games to its list of those playable on the Xbox One through its Backward Compatibility program. That list has been growing fast lately, and it won't be long before it reaches the next milestone of 400 titles. Nearly 11 years after the original game was released, the new Prey made its official debut on the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. Nvidia's latest GeForce driver update includes optimizations for the game. Sony revealed that it will hold its media briefing at the E3 gaming expo on June 12. Expect to see plenty of exciting announcements there, including a ton of awesome new games. However, Oculus confirmed that it's giving E3 a miss this year - the first time the virtual reality firm will be absent from the show since 2014. But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week with the beginning of a new journey across all of time and space. BBC iPlayer - which is exclusively available in the UK - will be streaming a special edition of this week's episode of Doctor Who, featuring immersive 3D binaural audio. But if you're not in the UK (or even if you are), you can enjoy a new Skype game bot developed by BBC Worldwide and Microsoft, in which you can help the Doctor to discover the pieces of the Key of Time, "an ancient and powerful artifact than could decide the fate of the universe". I've suddenly got a craving for some fish fingers and custard... Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Microsoft's spotlight was shining on its Surface Laptop this week, but the company also showcased a range of much more affordable PCs, some of which were priced as low as $229. Rich Woods took a closer look at some of those devices, which run Microsoft's new Windows 10 S edition. And Rich also got his paws on LeEco's new Le Pro 3, a flagship-class handset with a Snapdragon 821 processor, at a mid-range price point. Check out his unboxing video, including first impressions of the new device. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. If you're not yet a Neowin member, it's quick, easy and free to register - and you'll also see fewer ads on the site when you're logged in! From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

The conference brings together professionals from various sectors to address the marketing and public relations challenges presented by growing digital advancements globally. After a hiatus in 2016, Digital Future 2017 presents speakers from renowned organisations, under the theme “Digitise, Monetise, Realise”. Sonia Sengupta, Marketing Executive for MNet’s Eastern and Southern African channels, will bring insights from her experiences as a Market Researcher for GfK (the 4th largest Market Research company in the world), specialising in telecoms, consumer electronics and gaming sectors for the Angolan, Mozambican and South African markets. Sengupta will unpack the threat of digital to traditional industries such as broadcasting, publishing, tourism and transport, helping attendees to come away with an understanding of how these industries can actually harness digital in order to compete and stay relevant. With two companies in a race to become the first trillion dollar business: Alphabet (Google’s parent company) and Apple, Digital Future is proud to present Dane Knezic at this year’s conference. Knezic is a Technical Solutions Consultant at Google specializing in advanced Measurement and Attribution Solutions across Google AdWords, Analytics and Tag Manager. As a Measurement specialist, Knezic primarily works with clients in implementing advanced analytics solutions, and will shed light on where analytics fit into digital strategy. Attendees will learn how to track the performance of their brand’s digital activities, and how to optimise digital spend and maximise return on investment through analytics. Online reputation management is a critical success factor for every brand. Kalay Maistry, Business Unit Head at Magna Carta Reputation Management Consultants will present specialised knowledge drawn from over 20 years’ experience as a journalist and broadcast technical advisor. With experience as a Southern African correspondent at organisations such as Al Jazeera English, SABC, Talk Radio 702, ETV among others, Maistry will help attendees grasp the fundamentals of crisis management, and how to monitor a brand’s reputation and feedback online, turning customers into brand ambassadors in the process. Maistry will also provide an invaluable reputation management training session to give insights diving deeper into best practices and case studies in steering a brand in the public eye- both online and offline. The training will allow attendees to learn to create strong, actionable reputation management strategies with a clear return on investment.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « Apple Chooses Bosch for Sensors that Support Augmented Reality, In-Air Gestures, Indoor Navigation & Smart Glasses | Main | Apple's SVP Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiller thinks that Echo-Like Devices should have a Display » May 06, 2017 The EU Commission is preparing to Lay Down new Digital Policies for Europe to Punish Apple and Google   Back in April 2015 Patently Apple posted a report titled "European Regulators Sticking their Nose into Apple's Streaming Music Business before it even gets off the Ground." In August 2015 we posted a follow-up report titled "The EU Commission ends one Apple Music Probe while considering another." In that report we noted that "The European Commission failed to find evidence of collusion among the major music labels and Apple to quash free music streaming services such as those offered by Spotify."   Even with that finding, the EU appeared to be continually fishing for anything it could get on Apple that would allow them to open a new probe in an effort to punish U.S. tech companies and give European companies an edge.   So the EU Commission asked Spotify and other music streaming services for information pertaining to Apple's mobile App Store. Regulators were seeking information on the restrictions Apple places on apps offered through the store. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission similarly was exploring whether Apple's treatment of rival streaming music apps in the App Store violate antitrust laws. We covered that story back in July 2015 (one and two).   On March 29, 2017 we posted a report titled "New Analytical Report on Streaming Music Shows that Apple Music has taken the Lead in Unique Users by a Long Shot." Considering that Spotiy is considering an IPO later in 2017, this wasn't good news for them.   So what's Spotifiy's next move? We learn from a new Financial Times times report that "Spotify and a host of European internet businesses have called on Brussels to crack down on what they see as troubling practices by the likes of Apple and Google.   Big internet platforms 'can and do abuse their privileged position,' according to a letter signed by the chief executives of Spotify, music streaming rival Deezer and German start-up investor Rocket Internet among others.   Although the letter to the European Commission does not cite the Silicon Valley giants by name, it complains that some mobile operating systems, app stores and search engines have evolved from 'gateways' into 'gatekeepers' — effectively hindering rivals from competing with their own services. Apple and Google together control well over 90 per cent of mobile operating systems.   The letter comes in the midst of a debate inside the commission around overhauling digital policy, with new proposals due later this year aimed at addressing allegedly unfair contractual clauses enforced by big platforms."   In other words, the EU needed to have old grievances against Apple and Google revived so that they could justify their new digital policies that will no doubt come crashing down against Apple and Google in Europe. Even though their probes cleared Apple, they will now ensure to frame the argument according to their new rules to give European companies an edge.   It appears that the EU Commission is drunk with power. Jean-Claude Junker, the president of the EU Commission recently made it clear that Europe is growing twice as fast as the U.S. and that English is "losing importance in Europe." So with their new found power is it any wonder that they wanted to start a war with the U.S. on the technology front by striking at Apple first to set a precedent?   But that was just the beginning, the Financial Times report added that the EU Commission's new Digital Policy "Options being considered by the EU's executive arm range from sector-specific codes of conduct, to an independent dispute settlement body that would settle rows between big platforms and their often smaller business customers.   In the letter, the chief executives write that this mismatch requires 'specific rules guiding the interactions between platforms and their business users.' Normally, a company abusing its dominant market position would be covered by competition law.   But such cases take too long and cost too much for smaller internet companies, hence the need for extra regulation, they argue.   Common complaints from the companies include not being able to access customer data when they sign up through an app store, as well as big companies promoting their own services over third parties'.   Within the European Commission, there is a debate over how to approach the topic, with some calling for a cautious, narrow approach, while others are demanding that Brussels do more to rein in the likes of Google and Apple. Officials are also wary about being perceived as anti-American." Perceived? The EU is clearly anti-American on so many fronts, so this is nothing new.   It's clear that the EU Commission is out to force U.S. companies to abide by rules that favor European companies. Instead of a European company creating an OS for Europeans, they'll do the easier thing, force U.S. companies to bow to the world's ever growing economic power, Europe. We'll see how this plays out once the EU makes their new digital policies known later this year.   In the end, Spotify couldn't get US Authorities to break Apple as they wanted, so the EU Commission will now come to their rescue. What a joke. The reality is that the EU Commission knew that their new digital policies that are in the works are going to hurt Apple and Google and they needed a front argument to justify their moves. Spotify just happens to conveniently give them the excuse they need to hit U.S. tech companies.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology CyberSecurity Your Android phone can fall prey to nearly 8,400 pieces of malware every day, despite frequent security updates Google has been releasing frequent security updates to protect Android, but there is still a lot of work to do. Kukil Bora   May 6, 2017 18:17 IST Pedestrians look at their mobile phones near Brick Lane in London, Britain.REUTERS/Stefan Wermuth The sheer dominance of Google's Android operating system in the mobile market also comes with a flipside. Due to the increasing number of people using the OS on their smartphones and tablets, it has become the most preferred choice for hackers attacking the platform with malware. According to a new report from German software company G DATA, its security researchers discovered over 750,000 new Android malware apps in the first quarter of 2017. On an average, the number equates to nearly 8,400 new malware instances every day. The company, which specialises in security software solutions, said that the year 2017 was off to a slower start in comparison with the same period last year, in terms of new malware discoveries. However, the threat level for Android users still remains high, with around 3.5 million new Android malware apps are expected to be created in 2017. The G DATA report revealed that nearly 1.2 million Android malware samples were discovered in 2013. That number increased to almost 1.5 million in 2014, before it jumped to 2.3 million 2015. In 2016, the company spotted about 3.2 million Android malware instances. Malware attacks on Android is increasing over the years.G DATA While security vulnerabilities in the Android platform are nothing unusual, low distribution of Android 7 makes it more difficult to shield the OS from malicious software. "The problem is that third party providers do not adapt the new operating system for older devices ("older" in this case meaning one year or more). Sometimes, newer operating system updates are not published at all. Hence, in many cases it can take a long time before any updates are provided. That is, if they are provided at all," the report said. The G DATA report essentially underlines the significance of frequent security updates that OEMs need to roll out to their customers. For Google, it's even more important remain vigilant with Android accounting for the majority of the mobile OS market share. According to Gartner, Android powered over 352 million smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2016, accounting for nearly 82 percent of the market share. While Android is often criticised for being slow to protect users from vulnerabilities, Google has gotten serious over the years to make its mobile OS secure. But, there is still a lot of work to do. Android security leads Adrian Ludwig and Melinda Miller wrote in a year-in-review post in March that over 735 million devices from more than 200 manufacturers received security updates in 2016, these patches still didn't reach about half of Android users. "There's still a lot of room for improvement, however. About half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received a platform security update in the previous year," the duo said.

Murdoch's 21st Century Fox on Tuesday, Aug. 5, 2014 said it is abandoning its attempt to take over Time Warner in a proposed deal that would have combined two of the world's biggest media companies.   Gerry Smith and Mark Bergen Bloomberg WP Bloomberg     Google's pain may be Rupert Murdoch's gain. Murdoch's News Corp. is introducing a new service to ensure online ads don't appear next to fake news or offensive videos, marking the latest salvo in the billionaire media mogul's long battle with the world's biggest search engine. News Corp.'s Storyful unit, which filters through the firehose of social media for publishers and brands, will track websites known as purveyors of fake news or extremist content and share that list with advertisers, who can use it to keep ads from appearing in controversial places. It's pitched as a full blockade against content that's anathema to marketers, arriving as the two biggest forces in online ads -- Alphabet Inc.'s Google, and Facebook -- face pressure for failing to offer such tools. Google, in particular, has taken heat for its video offering. Several major advertisers stopped spending on YouTube last month over concern their ads could appear next to offensive videos. Google introduced controls to mitigate the problem, yet rivals are trying to exploit the issue. Storyful's new service will focus on "video brand safety," executives said. "This will be one way to give advertisers peace of mind," Storyful Chief Executive Officer Rahul Chopra said in an interview. Ad-buyer GroupM and marketing firm Weber Shandwick will be the first two companies to use the Storyful database. News Corp. will work with Moat, the analytics company recently acquired by Oracle Corp., and the City University of New York School of Journalism to maintain the list of controversial website domains. The database will be free, though Storyful eventually wants to provide a service to help advertisers decide where to place ads. Chopra said Storyful, which News Corp. bought in 2013, is working not just on compiling a list of controversial websites, but on identifying how such content spreads online to stop it earlier. He wants to "choke the money supply to people spreading content like this." News Corp. is the latest company seeking to capitalize on the advertiser boycott of Google's YouTube. And it's been nudging its way into the conversation about digital advertising that's increasingly being dominated by Google and Facebook. WPP Plc CEO Martin Sorrell told financial news site Cheddar recently that clients of his company, the world's largest ad agency, spend most of their budgets with Google, Murdoch's media empire -- including News Corp. and 21st Century Fox Inc. -- and Facebook, in that order. The tense history between News Corp. and Google goes back years. In 2009, Murdoch accused Google of stealing articles and threatened to pull his company's stories from its search results. Since then, News Corp. has become a much different company. In 2013, it split from 21st Century Fox, with Fox taking the lucrative TV networks and film studio and News Corp. keeping newspapers like the Wall Street Journal and New York Post. It's also added technology and digital real estate companies to its media empire. News Corp. competes with Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, in providing financial news and information. Google is also a News Corp. rival in other ways. Murdoch's company is developing its own ad network offering "one-stop shopping" for brands to buy ads on properties like the Wall Street Journal, New York Post and Realtor.com. It's an investor in AppNexus, an advertising technology company that competes with Google's DoubleClick platform. And News Corp. owns Unruly, which competes with Google's YouTube in social video advertising. Ad industry executives and computer scientists don't agree how companies should filter offensive content online -- or if they can. Some experts said that Google needs human editors to monitor YouTube; conversely, Google executives have said the sheer bulk of the video service means that only a machine intelligence solution would work. The YouTube boycott has had little visible impact on Google's bottom line. Most analysts see minimal loss to revenue, and the company's first-quarter results beat analysts' forecasts. CEO Sundar Pichai told investors he was "pretty confident" in the progress it had made with advertisers. Still, Google's triumphant first-quarter results prompted further complaints from publishers about a duopoly with Google and Facebook. The two companies accounted for 68 percent of all digital ad growth last year, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. News Corp.'s frustrations with Google have continued to fester. Early this year, the subscription-only Wall Street Journal stopped participating in a program that allowed readers to copy and paste a headline into Google and read the article for free. The move led to a bump in subscriptions, but also caused Journal stories to get fewer clicks, leading the newspaper's links to get buried in Google search results, according to a person close to News Corp. Google's algorithm crawls for keywords, while the Journal's hardened paywall only allows Google users to read the first few paragraphs of a story unless they're digital subscribers. The Journal's parent company, News Corp.-owned Dow Jones, feels it's being unfairly punished by Google for having a digital subscription model, said the person, who asked not to be identified discussing internal matters. A Google spokesman said the company does not punish or treat individual publications differently in search results. Few media companies have been more critical recently of tech giants like Google than News Corp. The YouTube boycott was prompted by a recent investigation by News Corp.'s London newspaper the Times, which found brands advertising next to YouTube videos posted by extremist groups. In a February earnings call, News Corp. Chief Executive Officer Robert Thomson cited the Times investigation as an example of the risks facing advertisers online. "Digital distributors have long been a platform for the fake, the faux and the fallacious," Thomson said on the call. He added "there will surely be a reckoning" in the ad market. murdoch-google Tweet This article filed under: Business Technology Bloomberg BizTech Newsletter Article Comments () Guidelines: Keep it civil and on topic; no profanity, vulgarity, slurs or personal attacks.

Name: Subject: Message: Android miracles: when seeing is believing Features Newsby Kris Carlon18 hours ago 19 222 21 The Android ecosystem is a pretty awe-inspiring environment, with close to three million apps in Google Play, over 1.6 billion Android devices in the world and close to nine tenths of the mobile operating system market in its grasp. But even within that vast narrative, a few events stand out as particularly noteworthy. I’m talking about Android miracles, the kinds of events you probably never would have believed until you saw them with your own eyes. I’m not going to claim divine intervention here and this list is by no means conclusive, but here are a few standout stories from the Android world. See also: The best OEM specific features 1 week ago Google nailed photography on its first try Google isn’t exactly a struggling startup with limited resources and a fledgling understanding of smartphone photography, but what it achieved with the Pixel camera is truly remarkable. The Pixel was the first truly “Google phone” where Google controlled the entire stack and it managed to instantly become the best smartphone camera anywhere, overnight. Meanwhile, other OEMs with hundreds of devices under their belts still struggle with smartphone cameras and image processing to this day. Much of the Pixel’s camera magic comes from its algorithms, something Google admittedly knows a little bit about. But for Google’s camera team to be able to apply the company’s search algorithm know-how to creating the best burst shot image processing around on the first attempt is still pretty miraculous. I can hardly even imagine how much better it’s going to get on this year’s Pixels. OnePlus, root and warranties Rooting an Android device comes with inherent risks, the kinds of risks that no OEM in their right mind would allow you to take and still fix your phone under warranty if you break something. But OnePlus was the right mix of crazy and loyal to its fanbase when it decided that rooting its phones would not instantly void your warranty. The company was smart enough to note that if you do cause damage to your phone through the process of rooting or unlocking its bootloader that it won’t be covered under warranty. This makes pretty obvious sense. The previously unheard-of offer OnePlus made was that if you had a problem with your rooted phone not directly attributable to rooting it or unlocking its bootloader, that it would still be covered under warranty as normal. Nvidia’s update miracle The landscape of Android updates more closely resembles a teeming swamp of over-worked engineers, disgruntled customers, and the carcasses of devices left behind than it does the fairy tale castle of iOS updates. But that still didn’t stop Nvidia from pulling off a legitimate miracle with the original Shield Tablet. That device launched in mid-2014 with Android KitKat on board. It was updated in early 2015 to Android Lollipop (within a week of Nexus devices), then to Android Marshmallow in January 2016 and finally to Android Nougat in February 2017. That’s four major Android version releases released for a single device – a feat not achieved by any Android smartphone I’m aware of (at least not officially). Who knows if it will also get Android O – but I wouldn’t be at all surprised if it did. WhatsApp is worth how much? This was another Android event no one saw coming. WhatsApp’s co-founder Jan Koum had only recently spoken out about WhatsApp never having ads because he preferred being accountable to the user (thanks to the $1 annual subscription fee). Fast forward a couple of weeks and WhatsApp accepted a Facebook buy-out that eventually became worth $22 billion by the time the deal concluded, with Koum the recipient of roughly $10 billion. The price tag was, and in many ways still is, staggering, spawning an entire meme factory around “things that cost less than WhatsApp”. In hindsight, there was never that many folks that could realistically buy WhatsApp, and they were all pretty big hitters. Google had already had a $10 billion offer turned down before Facebook opened its coffers, and Larry Page reportedly attempted, unsuccessfully, to outbid the Facebook offer at the eleventh hour. Despite knowing that even more money was ultimately on the table, it was still pretty unbelievable that a five year old startup could be worth that much money. Operation Human Shield A lot of folks say they’d die without their smartphones, but one guy literally would have. You may have seen the recent story of a Chilean man saved from a bullet through the chest by his trusty Honor 5X he kept in his breast pocket. The bullet miraculously failed to pierce the metal chassis of the smartphone and the man lived to tell the tale. If this story sounds kind of familiar, that’s because almost the exact same thing happened late last year with the Huawei P8 Lite and another poor guy in South Africa. Again, the man was shot during a robbery and was again saved by a well-placed metal-framed smartphone. The internet is rife with these kinds of stories, just going to show that while some of the other examples on this list may not exactly be supernatural, sometimes Android miracles really do happen.

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.  The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you’re updating an existing app or building something new, we’ve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing. It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 11 lies that PR and marketing agencies put forth Selling to a skeptical buyer is hard, but selling to a skeptical buyer who has been burned by deceptive marketing and PR companies is even harder. The internet has made it easier to deceive buyers about expected results from marketing and PR campaigns. No matter what a salesperson tells you, there is no guarantee of overnight success. Effective marketing and PR merely help you achieve business and sales goals. Credible marketing and PR pros will set the right client expectations from the outset and will follow through with hard work and a clear strategy over time. [RELATED: Find out how to make meaningful connections with your customers and thenews media at the Practical PR Summit.] Here are 11 common lies and half-truths that circulate in the marketing and PR realm: 1. We’ll guarantee to get you on the first page of Google. This is a ridiculous claim we hear routinely from marketers. Nobody can guarantee top placement on Google, because that’s in the hands of the search engine itself. Google has dealt with this claim in no uncertain terms: Beware of SEOs that claim to guarantee rankings, allege a “special relationship” with Google or advertise a “priority submit” to Google. “There are no priority submits for Google,” it states. 2. We will send you only high-quality leads. As with pledges of getting you on the first page of Google, this assertion is almost impossible to quantify. There is no independent definition of what constitutes a high-quality lead. Clients should outline those parameters. Once they do, most marketing companies will back down on the promises. When they tell you to describe the desired quality of the lead, ask good questions and point to examples of past clients and the method used, so everyone is on the same page. 3. We will offer you a free trial of our SEO or PR services. SEO and PR are involved processes that require long hours of work. Very few companies will be serious about offering you this at no cost. Typically, they will want your website’s username and password to do any work and will ask for access to your hosting account, and, after some pushy sales tactics, you will end up paying for their services. 4. You don’t have to do anything; we’ll do it all. This is meant to appeal to busy small-business owners who wish to ignore their online efforts. Never cede control of your business to someone else. You’ll lose track of what you’re being charged for and, worse, forfeit direction of your web presence, which is the equivalent of your shop window a generation ago. Retain control; do not let a marketing or PR firm hijack your operation. 5. You will be privy to secret and undisclosed strategies. Internet marketers like to tout a mystery ingredient or proprietary tool, as though they have a team of SEO whiz kids at a virtual Hogwarts just over the mountain. More likely they have a high school dropout leafing through the Idiot’s Guide to SEO in his mother’s basement. Any legitimate SEO company should be able to explain exactly what they will do with and for your site, as well as detailing their link-building strategy. A firm that talks of “secrets” might be planning to use black hat SEO techniques that could damage your site’s performance. 6. This is an amazing deal for you, and I don’t mind that it puts me in a tough place. Call it the martyr strategy. Ask yourself, though, why any marketer would put him- or herself in a tough place for you, and you will see that it’s just a ploy to make you think they are bending over backward. You need a win/win solution, so you don’t become the despised client. 7. This is a limited time offer; you have to act now. The limited-time offer is intended to pressure you to make a decision before you can give it much thought. Marketing deals aren’t like the last bottles of water before a hurricane. If you approached the same firm later, a “deal” would almost certainly still be available. 8. We work with someone at Google; we partner with Google. With Google accounting for about 68 percent of search engine marketshare, it’s easy to see why marketers would want to claim affiliation. However, Google has no partnerships in the SEO world, and Google employee would not jeopardize their jobs by illegally associating with any such firms. If a firm tells you it is partnered with Google, what else will it try to sell you? Drop it. 9. We have a successful track record. Many marketing companies make this claim, but what does it mean? Ask for the names of businesses that the marketer has helped; then contact those businesses to get their feedback. “Success” means different things for different business owners. Your job is to find out what that would mean for you. 10. We’ll get you off the ground with minimal investment. Beware of companies that offer freebies up front but take your credit card details. Always read the fine print; there’s probably a catch down the line. 11. You don’t have to worry; we’ll take ownership of your content. Don’t sign any agreement that would give ownership to the SEO agency you work with. If things go badly, the company can hold you hostage or the content could even be sold to a competitor. Read over your contract before you sign anything, to ensure you’ll own all content created by your marketing company. Victor Clarke is the owner of Clarke Inc.

David Gilbert asks whether to invest in these new piece of smart tech Business & Tech Google Home (David Gilbert) 12:00 6 May 2017 David Gilbert 20 hours ago Google is looking to revolutionize how our homes work. They have a smart thermostat company, Nest, a security camera, Dropcam, and most recently its Home speaker which allows you control a range of actions with your voice. However the one thing which all these devices have in common, and which makes them all work, is a wireless network, and Google is now looking to revolutionize that too. Google Wifi is a modular wireless solution that promises to eradicate the black spots in your home by creating a mesh network using multiple routers dotted around your home. While you can buy Wifi as a single unit, to get the most out of the system Google is selling the devices in multipacks of two and three. The system plugs directly into your modem, or in most cases today, the single device which acts as a modem and router. The other units are then placed at various locations around your home where your wireless signal is weak or non-existent. All devices then connect to create a mesh which envelops your home. Unlike many high-end routers on the market, which more closely resemble alien creatures, Google’s Wifi is a sleek device that will fit into most homes without standing out — which is a bonus as it needs to be in the open to work well. Hardware The hardware inside Google Wifi is not exactly cutting-edge when it is compared to other high-end routers and mesh network systems, but for almost everything you will require from it — including streaming 4K video — it offers more than enough performance. The cylindrical device features a USB-C charging port, and two gigabit Ethernet ports, one for connecting to your network, the other giving you the option to connect a networked hard drive or smart home hub. Google says that a single unit can cover a home around 1,500 square feet in size, with a mesh network comprising three of the units covering up to 4,500 square feet. In my testing of two units I found that the extra unit in my office at the top of the house certainly increased the speeds and reliability of the wireless network — though it was always good enough anyway. The real benefit of this system is in homes where your normal router cannot reach certain areas of the house. Set-up Where Google Wifi really shines however, is in its simplicity — both in setup and use. With wireless networks, the biggest pain can be in setting the things up, but with Google Wifi, the system has been streamlined to the point where it took no more than 10 minutes to get the thing up-and-running. The new Google Wifi app (available for iOS and Android) takes you step-by-step through the set-up process, where you name your new network, select a password, identify the device’s location and test the connection to your service provider. Once that has been done, you can go ahead and begin adding additional units around your home. To do this simply plug in the Wifi unit (no need for an ethernet cable) and the app will find the device. Again you tell the app where the device is located, and once you have finished it will test the mesh network which has been created to establish if the device has been placed in a good location. The app For most people all they want from a wireless network is reliability and speed. While Google Wifi cannot really address these issues (that’s still down to your service provider), it does make everything else a hell of a lot easier. Do you constantly need to refer to a dog-eared sticky note on the fridge when someone asks for the password to your wireless network? With Google Wifi the password is easily accessible in the app. You can see how many devices are hooked up to your network — just in case the next door neighbour is trying to stream Netflix using your network, or your child is using their tablet to play games online when they should be doing their homework. Sick of sitting at the dinner table with everyone looking at their phones and tablets? Google Wifi allows you pause access to the network for all, or a subset of the devices, connected to it. The app also allows you prioritize traffic to a specific device, meaning that if you want to stream a high definition film on your television, you can ensure a smooth playback by allowing it take the majority of the bandwidth. Summary There are a couple of drawbacks. Because you need to plug this into your modem, you are creating more cable clutter in your home, with each subsequent device requiring to be connected to a power point. It would also have been nice to see Google integrate the Wifi system into another practical device, like Home or one of its Nest Thermostats.  But overall these are minor quibbles for a system which is easy to use and can easily solve the problem of Wifi black spots in a house. A bundle of two units cost €299 while a single unit costs €169, meaning that while Google Wifi is cheaper than comparable systems on the market, it is certainly not cheap. However, if you have a large home and your current system means that the signal in certain parts of the house is just not good enough, then Google Wifi is an ideal solution. 12:00 6 May 2017 David Gilbert 20 hours ago 4 Related articles Looking for a good value home printer?

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 6 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman 7 swift steps to master SEO Anyone writing for a living today should know the basics of search engine optimization (SEO). Increasing your search engine ranking is a labyrinth contingent upon a multitude of fickle factors, but writing great content still plays an important role. Incorporating basic principles of SEO into your writing is not difficult, but it does require practice and preparation. Here are seven tips for SEO-friendly writing: Find your keywords. Once you’ve settled on a topic, use a site such as Google Trends or Buzzsumo to research what specifically people are searching for related to that topic. Make a list of consistently popular words and phrases you can target. To save time down the road, compile relevant topic-keyword lists to pull from in the future. Use your keywords. As you write your content, make sure your keywords appear regularly—but not too frequently. Google frowns on keyword stuffing and could rank your website lower if you jam in keywords all over the place. Using keywords in headlines, in subheads and in the opening sentences of paragraphs can bump you up Google’s rankings. Use your own words, too. Google tweaks its website ranking algorithm frequently, but one constant is the need to write content with human beings in mind. SEO is not all about pleasing mysterious Google robots. Writing high-quality content that people link to, engage with and share will boost your SEO. Length matters. Bite-size content is easy to read, but search engines such as blogs and articles with substance. Long-form articles tend to garner more shares and engagement, but longer isn’t always better. For blogs, between 300 and 600 words is a happy medium. That gives you plenty of scope to include robust detail (and keywords) without giving turning off visitors seeking a quick read. Use an optimizing tool. If you’re publishing on a platform like WordPress, there are free plug-ins that will get you SEO-friendly in no time. Tools like Yoast are easy to use and give you real-time analysis on your content, images and meta descriptions. Take a last look. This isn’t just an SEO tip; it’s one of the most fundamental principles of all writing: When you think your article is complete, read through it again—and then again. [Free guide: 10 ways to improve your writing today.] You will always find things to improve, for SEO purposes and for the benefit of your readers. Never settle for the first draft. Give it a push. Once your optimized content has been published, share it on social media. If your content is evergreen and timeless, you can continue sharing it—thereby continuing to reap SEO benefits—for years to come.

Diabolical. About 1 million users were affected, and although Google was on top of the issue within about an hour, some interesting things are cropping up in the aftermath — including claims that it was “just research” …?

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Update: Google Docs used for phishing? Not exactly 04 May 2017 11 Google, Malware, Phishing Post navigation Previous: NSA kept an eye on 151m phone records – but wait, didn’t bulk collection stop three years ago? Next: Have you got what it takes to hack the US Air Force? by Bill Brenner 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Updated Friday, May 5, 6:55 AM London time, with comments from Sophos principal research scientist Chester Wisniewski Since news began circulating last night of a phishing campaign parading around as Google Doc access links, the tale has taken strange twists and turns. A self-described graduate student claims he was behind the blast of emails, and that they were part of a test for a school project, not a phishing attack. But according to the university he claims to be enrolled at, he’s not a student there. Meanwhile, as the hours pass, it becomes less clear if what Google users received was truly a phishing attempt. Sophos principal research scientist Chester Wisniewski says it wasn’t, exactly: First and foremost, this is an abuse of Google’s APIs. While at first glance it appears to be a phishing attack, the emails come from Google and you are logging into the real Google. Last night, news and social media sites were ablaze with word of a new phishing campaign using fake Google Doc sharing emails to lure its prey, arriving in messages like this: Those clicking the link got a Google login and permissions page asking that they grant the fake Docs app the ability to “read, send, delete and manage your email” as well as manage your contacts: Rather than coming from the real Google Docs, this came from a bogus app called “Google Docs.” Later, someone calling himself Eugene Pupov took to Twitter claiming he sent the emails to test a program created for a graduate final. It was in no way designed as a phishing attack, he said: Cries of phishing At the time of writing, Pupov hadn’t returned messages seeking comment (if he responds, we’ll update this article). But his tweets expressed despair over the state of affairs. This story was carried by news outlets large and small, with ominous headlines about phishing attacks disguised as Google Doc access emails. Google itself confirmed it was investigating phishing attempts last night: Twitter was full of messages from people who received such messages. On the surface, it appears folks realized quickly that something wasn’t right with these links: Google acted quickly, announcing steps users could take if they had indeed clicked on the link: Wisniewski said it’s ultimately Google’s responsibility to stop these sorts of threats: Attacks on systems that are open for anyone to sign up as a developer using OAuth have been vulnerable to this type of attack for a long time, and the onus is on Google to do a better job vetting application developers. This is no different than the abuse of the Google Play store by malware authors. There is very little individuals can do other than be forever suspicious about legitimate requests from services provided by Google, Twitter, Facebook and other online services that use OAuth with an un-vetted application developer program. Twitter’s users were attacked using these techniques a few years back. Unfortunately, Google has also fallen victim to a similar attack vector. When users see official emails from Google and official login pages used in scams, this leads the goodwill Google has garnered from its users to be potentially damaged. All providers of OAuth have a responsibility to police the use of their platforms to stop users from being tricked through official requests from services like Google, Twitter and Facebook. We do suggest that users keep an eye on social media. As the Google Doc “phishing” attempt demonstrates, Twitter is a great early-warning system. There’s little doubt that the tweeted warnings saved people from being victimized. Is he for real? It remains to be seen if Pupov’s claims are genuine. An email we sent to his gmail account promptly bounced back, and we’re still waiting for him to respond to our questions via Twitter. One question we have: what was the exact purpose of his project? Other security experts, meanwhile, have pointed out that Pupov’s claims have not yet been independently verified. According to Coventry University, he’s not registered as a student there: What to do? The question, after all this, is what users should do to protect themselves. If this were a cut-and-dry phishing attempt, our tips would be to: Be careful what you click. This one is painfully obvious, but users need a constant reminder. Check the address bar for the correct URL. The address bar in your web browser uses a URL to find the website you are looking for. The web address usually starts with either HTTP or HTTPS, followed by the domain name. The real websites of banks and many others use a secure connection that encrypts web traffic, called SSL or HTTPS. If you are expecting a secure HTTPS website for your bank, for example, make sure you see a URL beginning with https://before entering your private information. Look for the padlock for secure HTTPS websites. A secure HTTPS website has a padlock icon to the left of the web address. Consider using two-factor authentication for more security. When you try to log into a website with two-factor authentication (2FA), there’s an extra layer of security to make sure it’s you signing into your account. Keep an eye on Twitter: As the Google Doc phishing attempt demonstrates, Twitter is a great early-warning system. There’s little doubt that the tweeted warnings saved people from being victimized. Since the details around what happened remain confused, it doesn’t hurt to take additional steps. For example, if someone believes they may have inadvertently downloaded a sketchy app, they can go to myaccount.google.com/permissions and revoke permissions for any apps they don’t trust. Wisniewski added: Users should check the apps they have approved to access their accounts and remove anything that may be suspicious on all OAuth-based platforms. For Google it is under your Google account -> Sign-in & Security -> Connected apps & sites. On Twitter and Facebook it is Settings & Privacy -> Apps.

Not exactly” John says: May 4, 2017 at 1:06 pm The account Eugene Pupov on twitter was only created this month, with the first tweet being that stating it was a test. The original profile picture was associated with someone completely different, which is now not associated with the twitter profile. It is unlikely this was a test. Reply Bill Brenner says: May 4, 2017 at 2:42 pm I share your skepticism, especially since Coventry University messaged me that he’s not really a student there. Reply Mahhn says: May 4, 2017 at 2:58 pm Do you think the tweets were to make people less responsive to cleaning up it’s dirty work? giving the impression it might be nondestructive Reply Bill Brenner says: May 4, 2017 at 3:01 pm That is certainly possible. Also possible is that this person was looking for attention. I doubt that, though. Reply Mahhn says: May 4, 2017 at 2:52 pm I only know of one person that fell for this, a coworkers mate at a different employer. Glad management gets to see the value in us blocking all public storage. Reply Wilderness says: May 5, 2017 at 12:44 am “Glad management gets to see the value in us blocking all public storage” That’s fantastic! Reply Edward says: May 5, 2017 at 5:03 am Except that google hasn’t fixed the vulnerability to completely spoof the omnibar and make the URL appear legit as well. At least the guy didn’t inject it with ransomware that would of been the most destructive attack in history I would imagine. Reply Keith Hanson (@keith_hanson) says: May 5, 2017 at 9:11 pm This really didn’t do much at all. I know it seems like all the facts are pointing skeptically at this new user posting the story, but the code itself (my team and I dove into it after I got caught up in it) seemed amateur, rushed, and didn’t actually do much at all with the power it held. Those facts seem to me to corroborate the student story. As for the student not being in their database – would you admit to the world under your real name as a college student? I sincerely doubt it. Reply John says: May 5, 2017 at 9:50 pm If it were an evil person instead of a student, they have a huge number of contact lists now and a huge number of email addresses. That alone would be worth $$$$ Reply Mario583 says: May 6, 2017 at 12:15 am Mailinator is used as a spam email that can ONLY receive never send. Reply Paul Ducklin says: May 6, 2017 at 11:29 am The mailinator address in the worm email is the To: address, not the From:, so that address *is* receiving, not sending. You get your copy of the email via BCC. Therefore the crook gets to keep track of how this thing is spreading. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

But did you know it has a feature that allows you to give your family complete access to your account's content after you're gone? By Savio D'Souza It's never a pleasant topic, but have you decided who gets access to your digital assets after you die? Here's how to bequeath your password-protected emails, photos and documents to your near and dear ones ­ and also about procedures one would need to follow to shut down dormant accounts... GOOGLE Almost everyone has a Google ID that can be used to sign into Gmail, Google Plus, Photos, YouTube, Calendar, Docs and Drive. But did you know it has a feature that allows you to give your family complete access to your account's content after you're gone? After you sign in, click on your user picture in the top-right corner of the page, and head to My Account. Then, click on Personal info & privacy, and scroll to the bottom of the page. Under Inactive Account Manager, click on Change This Setting. Here, you will find an option that allows you to add up to 10 trusted friends and family members who should be notified if you haven't logged in for periods ranging between three to 18 months. Google also lets you share your data with them if you choose. It should be noted, they do not get control of your account. Instead they will receive an email with a list of the data you have chosen to share with them, and a link they can follow to download it. In effect, your nominees get access to all your banking, insurance, and financial emails; your social networking passwords that are tied to this ID, your Photos collection, blog entries, videos, and everything else that you have stored on the Google ecosystem. You can also leave a message that will be emailed to them in the eventuality. This is a fantastic feature, and probably all you ever need, especially since you can use it to list all your internet account IDs along with their passwords, as well as your access codes to your computers, smartphones, insurance details, and more. The first step to ensuring that your digital content is handled exactly the way you want is to leave detailed instructions. Start by creating a list of all your online assets that you can convey to your nominee via Google’s Inactive Account Manager, or via the legal executor of your last will and testament. These should include logins and passwords of banking and financial sites (PayPal, Paytm…) email accounts, social networks, photosharing sites, online backup and file-sharing services, shopping and media subscriptions (Amazon, Flipkart, iTunes, Netflix), etc. Leave detailed instructions about which accounts should be memorialised, and which ones should be deleted. And finally, regularly update this list to reflect your most current holdings. Alternatively, you can also set Google to delete your account after your stipulated period of inactivity. This means everything, including your publicly shared data like YouTube videos, Google+ posts or blogs on Blogger will be purged permanently . MICROSOFT Microsoft also doesn't allow for the transfer of an email account to next of kin in case of death or incapacitation. This is applicable to all domains ending with @outlook.com, @msn.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, and @windowslive.com. But families--Microsoft specifies these to include spouses, parents and children--can request the closure of an account, and the release of its contents by contacting the Microsoft Custodian of Records at msrecord@microsoft.com. They will, however, need to furnish details like complete email addresses for which they are seeking this information, the complete name that was used to sign up for that account, as well as a death certificate, a legal document showing that they are the user's next of kin andor executor or benefactor of their estate, or that they have power of attorney . Once Microsoft is satisfied with documentation, it will transfer the contents of the account to a DVD, which will be shipped to the requester at the stipulated address. FACEBOOK For many, this social network is a place to forge new relationships, while solidifying older ones. We use it to interact with friends, share photos, and update them about our lives.But who gets access to your account after you? After signing into Facebook, under Settings, click on General. Then click on the last option: Manage account, and add a name from your friend's list as Your Legacy Contact. (In certain accounts, the Legacy Contact option can be found under Settings > Security). In event of the demise of an account holder, family members can request Facebook to 'memorialize' their page via an online form after providing proof of death. To do this, they will need to access the Help section under the question mark icon in the top-right corner. Once the page is memorialised, the person specified as the 'Legacy Contact' can write a pinned post for the profile (to share a final message or provide information about a prayer service), respond to new friend requests (for old friends or family members who weren't yet on Facebook); update the profile picture and cover photo, and even be given the option to download a copy of what you've shared on the social network. It should be noted that a Legacy Contact cannot log into the account, remove or change past posts, photos, read messages, and remove any friends. Under Manage account, users also get the option to request to have their account permanently deleted after friends or family lets Facebook know that they've passed away . TWITTER In the case of the demise or the incapacitation of a Twitter user, their next of kin can visit support.twitter.comformsprivacy to request the deactivation of their account. As soon as the option is selected, the requester will need to fill an online form with details like relationship to the user and contact email address. Twitter will then use these details to follow-up on the request. INSTAGRAM I Like Facebook, Instagram accounts can also be memorialised. To do this, next of kin will need to... Visit help.instagram.com. Click on Privacy and Safety Center and then on Report Something. Under Other Types of Reports, users will be guided through the entire procedure that would need to be followed to memorialise the account, or remove it completely . LINKEDIN The procedure followed by this professional networking service is similar to that of Twitter. In order to close a deceased person's profile... Visit LinkedIn Help at http:www.linkedin.com help and type “death“ in the search field. Click on the article that says, “Deceased LinkedIn Member ­ Removing Profile“ and follow the instructions listed there. The procedure essentially requires users to provide the deceased's name, web link to his her profile and their relationship with the person ­ whether colleague, family or friend.LinkedIn will review their request and get in touch with the requester about account closure. AFTERWORD | afterword.cc Instead of putting online credentials down on paper, consider Afterword. This service lets users save messages that will be sent to assigned recipients after their demise. These notes can contain confidential financial information, passwords, PINs, and links to audio or video messages. Afterword uses 256-bit encryption (along with double verification) to protect the messages and make them unreadable on its servers as well. With the free plan, users can save up to three messages and add recipients. They then have to choose trustee(s) who will have the right to inform Afterword with a “Declaration of Passing“. (Users can assign as many trustees as they like, as long as two are verified by Afterword.) Users can choose to send the messages after a specified delay , cancel a trustee's erroneous declaration and edit their messages as many times as they want. On confirming the demise of an account owner, recipients will receive an email from Afterword with a secure link to their private message. The first step to ensuring that your digital content is handled exactly the way you want is to leave detailed instructions. Start by creating a list of all your online assets that you can convey to your nominee via Google's Inactive Account Manager, or via the legal executor of your last will and testament.These should include logins and passwords of banking and financial sites (PayPal, Paytm...) email accounts, social networks, photosharing sites, online backup and file-sharing services, shopping and media subscriptions (Amazon, Flipkart, iTunes, Netflix), etc. Leave detailed instructions about which accounts should be memorialised, and which ones should be deleted. And finally, regularly update this list to reflect your most current holdings.

WFLA Published: May 6, 2017, 6:18 am Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) This March 2, 2016 photo shows an Echo Dot in San Francisco. Amazon.com is introducing two devices, the Amazon Tap and Echo Dot, that are designed to amplify the role that its voice-controlled assistant Alexa plays in people’s homes and lives. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) TAMPA, Fla. (WFLA) — They’re becoming part of our lives, internet-connected cameras, TV’s, baby monitors, and the newest electronic “must haves” Amazon Echo and Google Home. But, all that electronic wizardry comes at a cost to your privacy. Here are 8 devices that could be spying on you: Smart TV Your computer web cam Baby monitor Home Security Camera Amazon Echo Google Home Internet-connected doorbell Internet appliances Candi Taylor worries what her smart TV could be doing something other than entertaining her. “Privacy is privacy.  I don’t care if you’re God himself coming down to look at me. At least warn me,” she said. You aren’t getting any warning for the kinds of privacy invasions going on in the cyber world. “Any technology that you bring into your house could be abused and used against you,” said Professor Laura Malave. She specializes in cyber security at St. Petersburg College. “Alexa” and “Google Home” record everything you say after the “wake word.” The audio is stored in the cloud. “Someone hacks your account by getting your password, then they would be able to hear all of your stored recordings,” said Professor Malave. And that can expose private information to just about anybody. Did you ask about a certain drug or medical condition, or relationship troubles? It’s all out there for the taking. You can take an extreme measure and delete every recorded request. It can be done on the Amazon website. But Amazon warns: Doing so, will may cause Alexa to misunderstand your spoken commands. It “learns” your speech patterns as you use it. Some Samsung and Vizio models can track what you watch and share it with advertisers. TV’s with voice recognition are the most vulnerable.  You can shut down this feature by getting into the “settings” of the TV. For the person who is wanting extreme privacy, you can turn off all Smart TV functions and only use Apple TV, Roku, or some other means to receive internet video or content. Alexis Veatch never turns on her laptop camera. When told, somebody could turn it on remotely, she had this response. “I’d be throwing it out the window.” Apps like YouTube, on a smart TV open the door for data sharing. “That’s kind of like somebody going through your garbage. You definitely don’t want anybody seeing all your other stuff,” said Veatch. You can protect yourself by changing the default user names and passwords. “What they need to keep in mind is the privacy that all of this is tracking you throughout your different devices, it’s following you through the different apps,” said Professor Malave from SPC. There’s a sure-fire way to make sure the webcam on your computer isn’t spying on you.  “I have a lot of friends who put sticky notes on their cameras cuz they’re scared somebody can hack into their web cams,” said laptop user, Emily Bernard. Clever hackers could open bank accounts, watch you in your house, cause mischief by turning lights on and off, change TV channels and much more. Of course, you can ditch it all and go old school. “If I could get rid of it and go back the old basic TV, I would,” said Candi Taylor.

This tool will repair most computer errors, protect you from file loss, malware, hardware failure and optimize your PC for maximum performance. Quickly fix PC issues and prevent others from happening with this software: Download ReimagePlus (100% safe download and endorsed by us). Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. If you ask any loyal Android fan if Nexus 7 (2017) is ever going to come out they will say yes. Sadly, Google doesn’t want to share its opinion and its keeping every information about Nexus 7 (2017) under wraps. No one knows why the Android parent is being so silent about its upcoming tablet, but we have some theories which we will present them right now. Manufacturing Problems As everyone might know already, Google was supposedly going to unveil the revamped Nexus 7 during last year but this didn’t happen. Many believe that Google was actually all set and ready to unveil news about the tablet but Huawei had a sudden change of heart. The Chinese manufacturer was the one who took the job to produce Nexus 7 but then changed its mind when it found out that Google will not allow it to put its brand on it. While it might seem like a minor problem and that Huawei is overeating, this isn’t the case. Huawei has made sure to announce to the entire world that it’s goal is to become the biggest and the best smartphone manufacturer in the world and not being able to put its branding on the device made the deal unacceptable. HTC According to rumors and speculations, Google has already found a replacements for Huawei. The Android parent is going to collaborate with HTC in order to produce Nexus 7 (2017) and we’re going to see the tablet somewhere around the end of 2017. Even though all of this is based on rumors, it’s highly likely to happen since HTC is also the company that helps Google produce Pixel and Pixel XL. Operating System One of the reasons why Nexus 7 (2017) is so highly anticipated is because it is said to ship with a brand new Google operating system that’s been dubbed as Andromeda OS. Sadly, we need to inform readers that this is not going to happen. Well, at least that’s what Hiroshi Lockheimer (Head of Android) is saying. This means that Nexus 7 (2017) is going to ship with the upcoming Android 8.0 OS which also means that we might have to wait a while since Android 8.0 is still being developed right now.

Even though Google is a veteran in the smartphone industry, this last year the Android parent decided to purse its own career. Traditionally, Google teamed up with different hardware manufacturers such as Huawei, Motorola and LG in order to create some of the best Android powered smartphones ever made. However, things have taken a drastic turn last year. Google parted ways with Huawei and created the Pixel smartphone lineup on its own. Pixel Lineup The Pixel lineup represents the best that Google has to offer and this means that both Pixel and Pixel XL have been packed with cutting edge technology. Worth mentioning is that both smartphones are known for featuring the best rear camera ever made which surpasses even Samsung’s dual-pixel cameras. While it might like Google is generating huge profits as a result of going on its own path, this is not entirely true. Even though Pixel and Pixel XL are selling well in North America, we cannot say the same about Europe and Asia. What’s happening is that the Pixel brand is still quite new and it doesn’t have the necessary recognition. Nexus Revival Unlike the Pixel brand, Google has established the Nexus name as a powerhouse in the smartphone industry. This is one of the reasons why older smartphones such as Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P are selling so well to this day. In addition, their lower prices in comparison with Pixel and Pixel XL are also helping. With that being said, it’s pretty clear why Google might be looking to revive the Nexus brand. Global Recognition and Affordable Prices As previously mentioned, the Pixel smartphones are quite expensive in comparison with the likes of Nexus 6P. In fact, Pixel XL amounts up to $1000 in foreign countries such as Asia as a result of inflation and different economy. Just think about it, who would want to spend $1000 on a smartphone? No one. Revamping Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P and launching them only in foreign regions will be the smartest move that Google can make. This way, Google will generate huge profits from Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P’s success while not hindering Pixel and Pixel XL’s sales percentages at all.

Does Microsoft's Answer to Rival Chromebook Miss the Point? May 5, 2017 Shira Ovide | Bloomberg EMAIL Tweet Comments 0 Advertisement (Bloomberg Gadfly) -- I believe the children are our future. I also believe Microsoft's revamped technology for schoolchildren is sending worrying signals about the company's future.  Microsoft Corp. on Tuesday announced new and revamped technologies aimed at education, including laptops made by the company and its partners. This is all Microsoft's counter-strike against Chromebooks, a line of stripped-down laptops with Google software that have swept through U.S. schools. Chromebooks were 58 percent of the laptops, tablets and other mobile computing devices shipped to U.S. K-12 schools in 2016, according to Futuresource Consulting.  Microsoft has dangerous weapons as it tries to one-up Alphabet Inc.'s Google in technology for education. The company has decades of experience with schools, and it talked Tuesday about its advantages including the wide range of software for Windows PCs. Microsoft also has fresh ideas for education, including allowing students to learn software coding using Minecraft, the building-blocks video game owned by Microsoft.  Microsoft might have something to offer to schools that is better than Chromebooks. But at times on Tuesday, Microsoft executives seem to have misunderstood the lessons of Google's technology takeover in education. Chromebooks have found traction chiefly because there is nothing fancy about them. A Chromebook is essentially just a Web browser with a screen and a keyboard. It is simple to use for students and, more important, for the grown-up teachers and school administrators who can lock down what students can and can't do with the computers. Chromebooks work for education because they are no fuss. Microsoft's message is it can do no-fuss technology for schools, too, but with more bells and whistles. If that sounds like a impossible combination, it probably is.  ​Microsoft's message is odd because under CEO Satya Nadella, the company's technology is finally capable -- in principle -- of capitalizing on the "it just works" technology philosophy behind Chromebooks. Microsoft has made Windows easier to use and kept it constantly refreshed with new features and updates, just as smartphones and internet applications are.  At times, Microsoft's event on Tuesday felt like a regression to the bad old days when the company stressed superior features and functions of its software, not how it makes life easier for people. It's hard not to see fear behind Microsoft's regressive strategy in education. At first glance, schools appear to be an unlikely battleground for three technology superpowers, including Apple.  Education isn't a lucrative market. Google hardly generates any revenue from schools or universities including from Chromebooks , which typically retail for a couple hundred dollars or so. Microsoft and Google offer their word-processing, presentation and spreadsheet software free to schools and students through college. Even with their success in U.S. schools, Chromebooks are a fraction of the roughly 435 million PCs and tablet computers sold globally each year. But schools are about the future of technology. Every Chromebook in schools is a chance for Google to get young people hooked on Google's software and not on Microsoft's. Schools typically use Chromebooks to also access Gmail, word-processing software, spreadsheets and more. In universities, too, Google has made some headway in recent years with its alternative to Office, now called G Suite. Microsoft countered by refashioning its own school-oriented versions of Office. If those schoolchildren and college students don't use Windows and (worse) Microsoft Office, the risk is they will never want to use the Microsoft software when they go to work. Office is by far Microsoft's biggest product by revenue, and companies buying Office for their workers generate the lion's share of Office's $24 billion in annual sales. It's worth saying that Microsoft has always been in a dogfight in education technology, and it hasn't hurt its lock on software for work. Apple computers have been popular in schools for years, and yet when those children graduated they transitioned into Windows and Office for their jobs.  Times are different, though. It's easier than ever for people and companies to swap technologies, or mix-and-match their favorites instead of relying solely on old standbys like Microsoft. The Nadella-era of Microsoft knows this, even if executives ignored reality for a day.

Menon Last Updated: MAY 06, 2017 Hyderabad Email Author Andhra Pradesh could be the potential ground for experimenting and launching the innovations carried on by Google X. This was indicated by chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu, now on a week long tour of the United States,  after visiting Google's X facility that has developed Google's driverless cars and Google's glasses projects besides using balloons for spreading Internet. " Experiments such using stratosphere balloons to give access to Internet to inaccessible areas is one example out of many that can be experiment in our state," said Naidu. That Google X has agreed to collaborate with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and work towards internet penetration to enhance connectivity all over the state is a milestone moment. Google X CEO Astro Teller made a presentation about the ongoing research and development works at the facility during which a demonstration of the driverless car and use of drones to deliver various products at home was shown to Naidu and his delegation that includes the state finance minister Yanamala Ramakrishnudu, the state's Communication Adviser Dr. Parkala Prabhakar and the Principal Secretary in charge of Infrastructure and Investments Ajay Jain. While applauding Google for its pioneering research, the chief minister said that Andhra Pradesh is embracing technology and innovation and that it wants to collaborate with Google to further its mission. Naidu, earlier on the tour which began on May 5, held his first meeting with Russell Drinker, global director of the architectural consultants M. Moser that is to collaborate to build and develop Amaravati.

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.  The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you’re updating an existing app or building something new, we’ve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing. It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat.

I was not informed when I got it nor when I lost it. There were no clear rules who gets it. I also didn't see any marketing advantage (it didn't bring me more downloads). Chainfire XDA Same here. I did not ask to get it, and I did not ask to lose it. I did find it a bit odd to lose my badge with million upon millions of users and several apps with 4.0+ or even 4.5+ average ratings, while review-buyers and the likes retained theirs, but *shrug*. Google does as Google does. myssi This also means that Allo wouldn't inherit The Top Developer Badge anymore! Yayyyyy!!!

 Google Drive now hosts more than 2 trillion files Rob Price May 6, 2017, 4:32 AM 2,913 facebook linkedin twitter email print Files. Lots and lots of files. Manchester City Library/Flickr (CC) Google likes to talk about its stable of billion-user products — apps and services that have more than 1 billion people around the world using them. Google Drive isn't one of them just yet. But in April, it quietly passed another major milestone. 2 million files are now stored on the file-hosting service. Prabhakar Raghavan, Google's vice-president responsible for G Suite in Google Cloud, told Business Insider the stat at the Google Cloud Next event in London on Tuesday. At the Google offices, the exec said employees working on Google Drive are greeted with a very visible reminder of the product's progress since its launch in April 2012: "If you ever go to Drive's headquarters, you'll see this huge display up there that shows the number of monthly active users, and another one that shows the number of objects." Google Drive passed the 800 million user mark in January 2016. "Those numbers are powering ahead, I think principally because people are increasingly moving content to the cloud, and we'll be sure to tell you when we hit a billion." Meanwhile, the number of files or "objects" passed two trillion in April. That's 2,000,000,000,000. (That figure includes photos, videos, documents, and all other kinds of files.) It's not clear exactly how many files some of Google Drive's competitors host. In February 2016, Apple said it had 782 million users of iCloud — its cloud services — but not all of those may use it for file storage. And Dropbox says it has half a billion registered accounts as of March 2016. Registered accounts don't necessarily translate into active users, however. Raghavan said Google Drive has more than 800 million monthly active users — but "several billion" accounts overall. Prabhakar Raghavan, Google vice-president for G Suite, Google Cloud. Rob Price/BI The exec declined to say exactly how many users it has, or the rate at which it's growing. But he said he doesn't expect it to hit 1 billion users before the end of 2017. When it does, though, it'll be in good company. Google has more than half a dozen products with more than a billion users, including search, Maps, YouTube, Android, Gmail, and Chrome. Facebook also has a handful, including WhatsApp, Messenger, and the core Facebook app. CEO Mark Zuckerberg has even said a product isn't a real business until it passes the three-comma milestone: "This may sound a little ridiculous to say, but for us, products don't really get that interesting to turn into businesses until they have about 1 billion people using them."

Chandrababu Naidu meets Apple COO Jeff Williams in California, U.S.   V. Raghavendra VIJAYAWADA May 06, 2017 13:45 IST Updated: May 06, 2017 14:29 IST more-in The much-anticipated Apple's foray into Andhra Pradesh got a fillip following Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu’s meeting with the company’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams on Day-2 of his U.S. tour. Mr. Naidu told Mr. Williams that this was the right time for Apple Inc. to invest in India as it has been growing consistently. Being a State that has just begun building itself from the scratch post-bifurcation, A.P. offered tremendous opportunities. Apple would do well to enter A.P. which has been adjudged the best State to do business with and has a productive young population, the Chief Minister asserted. Gopi Sirineni, Vice-president of Qualcomm Technologies, expressed keenness to participate in the A.P. Fibernet project. Google X, a premier R&D laboratory of Google Inc. situated in California, came forward to offer Internet services up to the village-level in A.P. Mr. Naidu was an assurance to that effect by Google X CEO Astro Teller, who unveiled the plethora of innovations taking place in his lab in a presentation to Mr. Naidu during the latter’s visit to the Google X facility at Mountain View. Mr. Naidu was shown the autonomous car manufactured by Waymo — a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., Google glasses and high-altitude balloons that provide Internet access to rural areas. Later, Mr. Teller and Mr. Naidu had discussions on possible areas of collaboration between Andhra Pradesh government and Google X. During a separate interaction with potential investors, Russ Drinker, Director (global architecture, sustainability and environmental wellness) of M Moser Associates — a leading U.S.-based architecture and designing firm, evinced interest in partnering with Andhra Pradesh government in the construction of Amaravati. Padmasri Warrior, founder of NIO electric vehicle company and former Chief Technology Officer of CISCO and Motorola and Sridhar Vembu, founder of California-based software major Zoho Corporation, were among those who called on Mr. Naidu later in the evening. The Andhra Pradesh government signed MoUs with Innova Solutions, I-Bridge Inc and Evx Solutions, which are expected to provide jobs for over 12,000 people in the State.

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks, Daniel Brierton and Ailín Ó'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>  // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>  // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>  // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>  // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It’s as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let’s try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They’re not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing – picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize – it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ailín Ó’S And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ailín Ó’S No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though 😂😅 ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI 😩 Ailín Ó’S They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it 😂 Ailín Ó’S The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to €, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Dang. Well, so much for that plan. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ailín Ó’S Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ailín Ó’S Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity 😂 Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in São Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical​advanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Renan Magnetic cards aren't the rule here, we mostly use a card with a contact-chip (and the magnetic stripe, but I've never used it) that looks a lot like a SIM card chip. And I don't even know how a Contactless symbol looks like :P Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT. Fingers crossed. 4Ui812 Off topic but , Trini women are hot. xyz This is the sort of comment that is better to keep in your head and not actually post. Disqusman Trinidad and Tobago?!!

Google Phone 9.0 prepares to add Android O's Notification Channels, picture messaging, post-call messages, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:00am PDTMay 2, 2017 72 Plus 1 on G+ 91 Share on Facebook 75 Share on Twitter Total Shares238 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Notification Channels for Android O 1.2 Post-call messaging 1.3 Convenient picture messaging 1.4 Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes 1.5 Cat and dog paws? 2 Download Late last week, an update to Google's Phone app began rolling out with no immediately obvious changes to the experience. While users don't have anything to play with quite yet, there are several interesting hints about what is to come in future releases. Hidden among the app's resources are signs of support for Android O's new Notification Channels feature, in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging, hidden menu codes for Motorola phones, and even some odd images of paws. Yes, seriously. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Notification Channels for Android O While it's a fairly small feature when compared to some of the improvements we've seen in many major OS updates, the Notification Channels brought to us by Android O are exciting. Most of Google's apps are still not implementing this addition to the API, but it's clearly in the works with the Phone app. While they don't appear to be fully implemented yet, names have been added to the latest apk update that describe six separate channels, including: Incoming calls, Ongoing calls, Missed calls, Voicemails, External calls, and Miscellaneous. <string name="notification_channel_incoming_call">Incoming calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_ongoing_call">Ongoing calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_missed_call">Missed calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_voicemail">Voicemails</string> <string name="notification_channel_external_call">External calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_misc">Miscellaneous</string> That's a pretty thorough list given the nature of the Phone app and the types of notifications it shows, especially since most users will probably never even see a couple of them. While the strings are there, only the standard Miscellaneous channel is visible in the notification settings screen for the Phone app. In all likelihood, the implementation probably wasn't complete when this update was built, so we can probably expect to see it in the next release, or possibly when the second developer preview image becomes available. Post-call messaging Receive a phone call today on almost any modern phone and you can probably tap or swipe something on the screen to reject it and immediately reply with a pre-written text message to say you're unavailable or will call back shortly. It can be a useful feature, even if it's just for those times when you're driving or stuck in a meeting. But what should the caller do if they don't get through? Leaving a voicemail is turning to be too cumbersome, so many people now send a text instead. New lines in this update suggest the same type of prepared text messages might be added for the caller, as well. There are a few new lines going into this feature, but three are the new, pre-written messages meant to convey varying degrees of importance. They are simple messages crafted to let the target of the call know that your needs are urgent, important but not time sensitive, or you just called to chat. <string name="post_call_add_message">Add message</string> <string name="post_call_message">Say why you called</string> <string name="post_call_message_1">This is urgent. Call me back.</string> <string name="post_call_message_2">Call me back when you have some time.</string> <string name="post_call_message_3">Not urgent, we can chat later.</string> <string name="post_call_message_sent">Message sent</string> There aren't any other clues to suggest how this feature will be presented to the caller or if a custom message can be written from the same screen, but it's likely this feature wasn't complete yet, either. Unless some clever tricks are necessary to make this feature smart, it seems like there probably won't have to be too much more work, so it may go live with the next update. Convenient picture messaging For many years, phone manufacturers have experimented with bringing certain features to the surface during calls so users don't have to spend too much time poking at their phone to do things that people are likely to need in the moment. One feature that has been popping up occasionally, even as far back as the days of dumb phones, was the ability to quickly take a picture and send it directly to the person in the same conversation. It looks like the same feature is probably destined for Google's Phone app. <string name="received_a_photo">Received a photo</string> <string name="sent_a_photo">Sent a photo</string> There are a few other strings possibly related to this feature, but the two above are the only ones that really matter. They represent the basic status messages to show a picture was sent or received. Again, it's not really clear if there are any clever features that make this a little smarter, but I have a hunch the Phone app will listen for messages containing images (I assume both MMS and RCS) and instead of making users switch to their messaging app, the photos will be shown automatically or with an on-screen button. Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes Hacking around with a phone can be fun and enable a lot of powerful features, but it often involves a lot of secret methods that aren't intended for the public. Dialer codes have been used as one of the key methods for accessing special menus and functions. A long list of Motorola's dialer codes was included in the latest Phone update. Some of these are pretty old, but at least a few of them didn't turn up in any of my searches, so I thought some people might want to experiment with them. Disclaimer: Use of these dialer codes is done at your own risk. Some of these may damage your phone and/or void its warranty. You've been warned. If you want some information on many of these codes, you can find about 3/4 of them listed in this 2012 post by well-known security expert JCase. The behavior of the remaining codes is currently unknown and didn't turn up in my research. Only try them out if you know what you're doing and prepared for the possible consequences. code <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_sequence"> <item>\##66236#</item> <item>\##2539#</item> <item>\##786#</item> <item>\##72786#</item> <item>\##3282#</item> <item>\##33284#</item> <item>\##3424#</item> <item>\##564#</item> <item>\##4567257#</item> <item>\##873283#</item> <item>\##6343#</item> <item>\##27263#</item> <item>\##258#</item> <item>\##8422#</item> <item>\##4382#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern"> <item>\##[0-9]{6}#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern_intents"> <item>@string/motorola_hidden_menu_intent</item> </string-array> Cat and dog paws? Finally, a couple of quirky images were added to this update. A pair of paws, one belonging to a cat and the other to a dog, can now be found in the apk's resources. Note: Images were converted from webp to png. I'm not yet sure what they are used for, if they belong to an Easter egg, or maybe somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we were still watching. Both images have transparent backgrounds and look like they could be used for a simple animation where a paw reaches up to grab an object on the screen and drag it away. Whatever the case, ya gotta love the whimsy and humor.

It would be nice for OEMs to give us a choice, but I doubt it will ever happen aRvInD Yes it will work, if you root, install GPhone as system app and make it default Phone app. Thats how I'm enjoying this on my Oneplus3...! DragoCubed Dog 🐅 and cat 🐈 paws. :3 awwwwww DynamikD That is definitely a tiger 🐅. DragoCubed I hate the Samsung emoji makapav I bet it will still not support sending call-reject text messages through Google Voice. Sigh... Kyle Salewski Yeah. Even hitting the Message button on a contact won't work. They really need to allow Voice to be the default SMS app makapav Well done bro. You're a fellow dedicated Google Voice user to figure that out and complain about it. I wanted to bring that use case here to my rant but figured probably no one else jumps through that hoop like me! ;-) Clearly Google has the laziest/clueless Android users on their team because some of these obvious use cases go unknown to them. chocolate_drizzle I think they should add seemless Google Duo integration by adding a video calling option in the app. What do you guys think? DynamikD I think you are on to something! 👍 bunchofpenguins Facetime does this where you can press a button and switch right to Facetime. I have been wanting this in Android forever. Chris My girlfriend and I enjoy using Duo all the time, so this would be perfect. But then Google would need to release their Phone app for all Android phones in the Play Store. Carson Saldanha No, they could just add support for it in their own. Andy J If the photo features are indeed for RCS (and sending photos while in a phone call is indeed a feature specifically detailed in the RCS spec) - then in the same way Messages is available to all Android phones, the phone app would also have to be on the store. And the Contacts app will probably go on too - because a key part of the RCS spec is that the phone address book will show which contacts have "enhanced messaging" available. Chris I hope so. I love the Google Dialer and Contacts but I have to use an old APK to get it to run on non Nexus or Pixel devices. Deeco Too logical for Google JG I could see where that could come in handy... However I'm not sure if Duo has picked up enough traction to really make it useful enough to integrate it into the dialer. If the recipient doesn't have Duo installed (as possibly would be the case the majority of the time - at least from personal experience) then a Duo video call button would just be extra clutter... Berni Hargrove But this is how you give it traction. Intuitively integrate it into a regularly used feature/app of the phone. The dialer is a perfect fit to help give Duo more relevance. Biga173rd Does this APK work with non pixel phones? Siddharth Nope except Nexus devices Biga173rd Thanks Cody Toombs It's meant for a few things people forget, but definitely not all phones. The full list should be: Pixel, Nexus, Android One, and Motorola. Carpentractor Ok, I have been experiencing a weird bug with my Pixel keypad while in call. Basically, the keypad gets smushed when accessing the keypad in call and it cuts off the letters ​under the numbers, which are sort of useful when spelling last names for extensions... It happened to me several updates ago and uninstalling all of the updates for the app and putting it back to how the phone came originally would fix that issue, but obviously take away any new features that have been added to the dialer. But, this time when I tried to uninstall the app updates, it didn't fix the issue! Everytime I see an update for the dialer, I get excited that they may have fixed it, but to no avail. My girlfriend has a Nexus 5X and she does not have the issue. I have attached a screenshot, please let me know if anyone has a solution or is even experiencing the issue. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd8b277825ef665ffa607ce2aa8b3a0004b8109cba32e68655dcd11afd7834ec.png DynamikD I, personally, have never experienced this and I have the same device as you. By any chance, are you running any 3rd party app(s) that also integrated into the dialer? Carpentractor I don't think so, I did have Skype installed at one point, but I did uninstall it. What kind of 3rd party apps might integrate with the dialer? I guess I can try to boot up in safe mode.... Rod What's your font size? Carpentractor Large. Carpentractor So, I changed my font back to default and it did solve the problem. Is there no way to have my font set to large and have the dialer format properly? My girlfriend has her font set to large with no issues on her 5x. This is whacky! Rod Have you changed the DPI? Carpentractor Not as far as anything beyond having my display size also set to large. Morenicano $5 says this will be a new messenger app by next year Richard Dennis and they will move half of Allo's features to it.. So you now need both apps... And hangouts is a new email app. Yuku Sugianto Why do Motorola codes appear on Google's Phone app? Probably the next Nexus/Pixel line phone will be made by Motorola, and Motorola service staff are already accustomed to those codes to diagnose problems. Cody Toombs Sorry to kill this theory, but Motorola has a arrangement with Google to use a lot of Google's first party apps. It's been in place basically since Google bought it and began shipping the Moto X with nearly stock AOSP with some product specific enhancements. As far as I am aware, all (or most?) Motorola phones use Google's Phone app. Even if that weren't the explanation, the Nexus 6 would be. I mean, a Moto-made Pixel could still happen, but these phone codes aren't evidence of that. Kevin Burton Could the "paws" be for sequence dialing? When a "pause" is entered you get a "paw" displayed on the phone? AintaDamnThingFunny I like the phone app. My only complaint is it's not the most intuitive thing on earth to try and answer/reject a call by swiping up/down. I routinely need 3 or 4 tries to get it. Or maybe it's just me? I think swiping side to side is easier. Maxr1998 "somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we we're still watching" - that one "we" seems to be too much 😜 SomeGuy112 I notice the button animation is gone when pressing the button to bring up the dialer now.

New X Button Appears In YouTube App For Some Users Liam Spradlin Follow View All Posts 2015/08/04 5:25pm PDTAug 4, 2015 146 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 2 Share on Twitter Total Shares175 Applications Design News Google may have finally unleashed the new YouTube app layout to the world after four months of testing, but that doesn't mean it's done tweaking the YouTube app or testing new design features. The latest tweak-in-testing, after a redundant (and non-standard) share icon is a new X button on the video player. Right now, if you're watching a YouTube video through the official YouTube app, you can tap the video player to bring up the scrubber and lots of other controls - minimize, add to playlist, share (again), full screen, and an overflow menu which offers quality and closed captioning options. To dismiss the overlay, just tap the player again. The new X button that's showing up for some users duplicates that action by also dismissing the overlay.    It may seem mundane, but this is an interesting tweak. After all, its purpose - at least as far as I can guess - is to make the action of dismissing the video overlay more discoverable, despite the fact that the action to call the overlay is no more discoverable than its current counterpart. Google seems to be a company that likes to inform certain aspects of design with data, though, and after all the tweaks we've seen to YouTube lately it's not unreasonable to think that this tweak has some basis in user research. It could be, for example, that Google found users tap the video expecting it to pause and only discover the overlay accidentally, thereby making the connection between tap and overlay somewhat tenuous. On the other hand, actions that relate to the behavior of the video as a whole live on the overlay, and the X only refers to the overlay itself, so before tapping it, a user might think "this will close the video." But all of this is why Google performs tests like these in the first place - to figure out what works best and how. Whatever the case, there's probably a better way to approach the video player's overlay in a holistic sense, but that would be a much larger change - and a more difficult one to work into existing models of user behavior - than simply adding yet another icon to the collection. Have you seen the new X button yet? Thanks Łukasz! Tags app button design Google tweak x youtube subscribe ...

It has nice material design and animations, plus useful swipe/drag gestures for rewinding and fast-forwarding. I just want the folks at Google to be flippin consistent with their design, goddammit! Liam Spradlin I do love the Play Movies player, but I think bringing that kind of change to YouTube would be really hard (at least internally). I can imagine that since YouTube is such an established product, with a huge existing userbase that has very strong opinions about the product (see the reaction to any change to the home page or channel pages ever) Google probably wants to be extremely cautious with any significant changes. But if they found that the new web player worked out well, maybe there's hope for mobile. Though I'm sure it wouldn't come without more months of testing :P Juan S. Camargo Visbal But they will make the player useless. senor_heisenberg Yeah, you're right. I at least wish they'd do a testing phase like they do with other apps/software/services, like what you mentioned about the YouTube web player. The current app player just looks so holoish and outdated. Guest Pls fix that share button Xorok It is fixed in the screenshot No It isn't. Justin W He's talking about it being the wrong share button. It imitates the Reply button from Gmail, when instead it should be the standard share icon seen throughout the pretty much the entire OS and many other apps except for this one spot. Frog Smurf I don't understand Google. They manage to mess up every tiny thing, then take months to fix it. How card can it be to replace the existing share button with the one they use in every single app? -Matoro Zeliph- Oh, it's those Googlin Dushebags doing their "trolling" development like they always do. Nathaniel V ... -Matoro Zeliph- That was on purpose Malachi Jones Lies. Frank Duque I've had that X present for as long as can remember. Seriously though, I hate it Andrew I had it too! It got to the point where I couldn't hide anything even hitting the X. M.e.Puente Good to hear I'm not the only one bothered by the share button Richard My share button is gone, with the last update. So stop complain.... or maybe yours 'goes away' too :-) M.e.Puente It's not about it being there. I actually like it there, I use it all the time. It's about continuity and a standard design for the way the button looks. You would think the Material Design guidelines would address this. SpcyChicken You just went full retard Marc I'd like a pretty cool feature called.... Drag and drop grid playlists... :+ still missing from both the app and desktop site. Organising a playlist shouldn't have to be a chore :( Irwin Also the "Watch Later" link is up top now, no longer lost within the playlists I have. "Watch Later" still doesn't work efficiently though, removing a video in the middle of the list still jumps you back to the very top/oldest video... sigh... Van_Hammersly Glad I'm not the only one who thinks removing vids the Watch Later playlist is completely broken if you have more than 7 videos. Cool I have had the X button for at least a couple months now. I didn't realize this was new to some people. What is more interesting in the YouTube app is now you can skip advertisements when using the Chromecast. As far as I remembered you weren't able to before until very recently. Ryan Hoffmann I've had this for months, although it randomly disappears and reappears. IMO the tap to dismiss was better. Sicilian That is kinda facinating, how YouTube app gets more and more shitugly. First that godawful and totally unintuitive arrow icon for sharing. Then the monstrosity of hamburger-free layout. Now this... Midnitte I just wish they would make the notification bar and navigation bar disappear reliably when playing a full screen video, not to mention after the update to play full screen vertical videos the app no longer changes orientation reliably... Still, an interesting change. I've frequently misclicked the pause button only to have the overlay disappear. David I got the UI update a week or so ago in Indonesia, but no X yet. Guess I am not worthy. Ahnaf Mahmud I got a new loading symbol on YouTube app today but now it's gone. Michael I bet they added the X to close the video so you can control 360 videos with touch. That's the only logical thing I can thing of. Cod3rror Give it a background audio! (without having to pay for it) mike shwilly But...... you can tap the whole screen .. Like.. how is this useful? Google please... SpcyChicken Because if you are viewing a playlist you cannot tap the sceen to make it go away or it switches to another video. This is a long needed feature. dhamp2g IDK about you guys but I get lost on YouTube for hours when I open the app. Just soooo much interesting content Doms I've had this feature for weeks and it drives me up the wall its so annoying I tried to unistall updates to get it back to tap to fade away but it didn't work apolloa Yeah, noticed the new version in my Chrome browser and on my Nexus 5 and all I have to say is in the usual typical Google fashion they have improved some things whilst breaking others, every single year they do this, every single year.... would be great if they just left the thing alone! I guess at lest this year they didn't make a clusterfuck of the interface as per the norm for them? Alan S This would happen to me whenever I streamed to my Chromecast and it's been like this for weeks now, I love that Going is always actively tweaking their apps. Matthew Fry Why not make it stop the current video? It's kind of a pain now to ensure that the video has stopped. The background play sometimes activates even if I've paused it.

As reported, one million Google users’ accounts were hacked, thanks to the scam. But the question then arises: how does one know what account is safe and what isn’t. The answer is simple. Follow the steps to know how you can get rid of apps that you feel breach your online privacy. - For starters, go to your Google Account Page ALSO READ Google Docs phishing scam: Here's everything you need to know! - The first option is Sign in and Security. At the bottom of that option is an option that says, Connected Apps and Sites’ - You are then redirected to a new window where if you scroll down, you come across an option that says, “Manage Apps” - You can choose the applications that you don’t want synced with your Google account by clicking on them and then selecting the Remove option A 'phishing' scam that tricked people with what appeared to be Google Docs links was doused by the internet giant after spreading wildly. The scam combined "a phishing attack and a worm," using a deceptive email to get people to open the door to malicious code that wriggled into their messaging programs to spread itself to others, according to Electronic Frontier Foundation staff technologist Cooper Quintin. Email sent from a known contact's real address would arrive containing a link it claimed led to a file to be shared at Google Docs online service, according to a rundown of the chicanery.

With Map Maker closed, road segment editing is available to all users on Google Maps Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 8:49am PDTMay 4, 2017 24 Plus 1 on G+ 58 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Applications Google News Map Maker was completely shut down on April 2nd and at the time, Google promised that its features would find their way to the main Google Maps app. Part of them was implemented long ago last September with the addition of missing info and fact checking cards, but that left the main Map Maker function of editing road segments. It was enabled for Local Guides a while ago and according to a post on the Local Guides Connect community, it has been made available for everyone on April 27. Sure enough, I checked on my phone and I can see the option to edit road segments. You have to open the side menu, scroll down to Send Feedback, and choose Edit the map. After that, you can pick any road segment and suggest a new name, say the road is 1- or 2-way, tell it the road is closed, and so on. I'm not sure how long these options have been there for — we're inclined to think at least a couple of months, depending on your Local Guide level — but they appear to be accessible to everyone since April 27. They might seem a little hidden away under the Send Feedback menu (that's usually a section users don't venture into that often), but it's probably precisely for that reason that they've been tucked there. You don't want any and all Maps users to suggest edits for the fun of it without knowing what they're doing.

The only real difference now is when you're reporting an issue with how a road is drawn or two-way status or something like that (something you could always do), you can now directly select which road segment you're talking about to make your report more clear instead of trying to describe the location. And there's still no way to report issues with lane guidance (aside from typing it in as a note on a report that is labeled as something completely unrelated to lane guidance), which has about a 2% accuracy rate around here.... catalysto Works for me. XerBlade Really? Because I just read through Google's official article introducing this "road editing" and how this works, and it was exactly what I just described. In other words, they are stretching the meaning of "editing roads" to the extreme. Literally the ONLY difference between what you could do before and what you can do now is you can select multiple road segments when making a report instead of just dropping a pin on a single spot. The reports themselves are the same. No actual editing any roads. Morten Ulv Map maker was never available in my country and reporting this way works great. Issues are usually fixed within a week. Getting these better tools now is just a bonus for me. iMarbot Like I said months ago. Google lied about bringing MapMaker into Maps. You simply cannot do anything as comprehensive. Ome Dries Despite the few pranks people pulled with Map Maker, I think it was a great product and a very important factor for Google Map's success. Were other maps (including the paid maps on my navigation system) are always outdated, not containing new roads or still having older roads, and almost almost missing details in roads (and bike roads) Google Maps was always better. It's an advantage they could now be loosing, because even with today's update they don't have a full substitute for Map Maker. PANDAMONIUM🚀 Since they restricted Map Maker I've found Google Maps to be very very slow in updating roads that have been recently paved or changed due to construction or new construction. Waze is a better option now for a more accurate navigation experience in my area. And their map editing tools are far superior. They also are heavily moderated, but they didn't do what Google did with Maps. Google just took a machete and cut off the whole limb because of a few bad apples. All they needed to do was follow Waze's guidelines and they'd be set. utack >Google Maps was always better I am guessing your sample size is only USA on this? Anjo Cerdeña It's still available for select regions only. I'm a level 5 Local Guide in the Philippines and it's been announced to us in a closed mapping event last month, but I still get this screen when choosing Send Feedback ❯ Edit the map. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1d4020ba64330ad00e1c6e65089b1c8117f572172e73de6dfe074f0e351ed2c2.jpg Anjo Cerdeña It was announced and made available to Level 5 Local Guides last March 8. https://www.localguidesconnect.com/t5/News-Updates/Exclusive-Edit-a-road-segment-in-Google-Maps/ba-p/149865 rndusrnm479461 How come I didn't know this!? Anjo Cerdeña Because you're not following me on Google+ yet? 🙃 https://plus.google.com/+AnjoCerdeña/posts/CDKD2kXPJbW Rita El Khoury That's exactly the source of this post. But the reason I said we don't know when these started showing up is because they might have popped up before they were announced on the Connect community. Google isn't always fast in acknowledging something is happening and we've often covered features for Local Guides that weren't yet officially announced. Anjo Cerdeña Right, and the availability is geographically limited on announcement day too. I'm a Level 5 Local Guide in the Philippines and I still don't have it yet. Here's what I get when I go to Send Feedback ❯ Edit the map. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1d4020ba64330ad00e1c6e65089b1c8117f572172e73de6dfe074f0e351ed2c2.jpg Martin They need to add a lot more options to that menu. Right now there isn't much you can do besides the few options you listed in the article. For the rest you need to write a note, which doesn't seem very efficient. For example I want to mark a road as closed to bicycles, something you could easily do in Map Maker.

"For years defendants have knowingly and recklessly provided the terrorist group ISIS with accounts to use its social networks as a tool for spreading extremist propaganda, raising funds and attracting new recruits," family members of Sierra Clayborn, Tin Nguyen and Nicholas Thalasinos charge in the 32-page complaint, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles on Wednesday. Subscribe to Newsweek from $1 per week "Without defendants Twitter, Facebook and Google (YouTube), the explosive growth of ISIS over the last few years into the most feared terrorist group in the world would not have been possible," the complaint said. Spokeswomen for Twitter and Google declined to comment on the lawsuit. Representatives for Facebook could not immediately be reached by Reuters on Thursday afternoon. Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday gathering of Farook's co-workers at a government building in San Bernardino on Dec. 2, 2015, killing 14 people and wounding 22 others. Farook, the 28-year-old, U.S.-born son of Pakistani immigrants, and Malik, 29, a Pakistani native, died in a shootout with police four hours after the massacre. Authorities have said the couple was inspired by Islamist militants. At the time, the assault ranked as the deadliest attack by Islamist extremists on U.S. soil since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. In June 2016, an American-born gunman pledging allegiance to the leader of ISIS shot 49 people to death at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida before he was killed by police. In December 2016 the families of three men killed at the nightclub sued Twitter, Google and Facebook in federal court on allegations similar to those in the California lawsuit. Federal law gives internet companies broad immunity from liability for content posted by their users. A number of lawsuits have been filed in recent years seeking to hold social media companies responsible for terror attacks, but none has advanced beyond the preliminary phases.

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks, Daniel Brierton and Ailín Ó'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>  // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>  // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>  // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>  // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It’s as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let’s try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They’re not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded. This needs to be completed for Visual ID to work</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_button">Try upload again</string> <string name="handsfree_checkin_notification_title">Checking In</string> <string name="handsfree_checkin_notification_text">This is needed for Hands Free Loyalty to work</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_title">Identifying you near checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_location_text">Visual ID uses Bluetooth and other signals from your phone to detect your location.</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_location_title">Knowing you're near a store</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_privacy_text">When Visual ID confirms your identity, Google sends your loyalty info to the store, but does not share any other info about you. You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing – picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize – it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ailín Ó’S And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ailín Ó’S No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though 😂😅 ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI 😩 Ailín Ó’S They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it 😂 Ailín Ó’S The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to €, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Dang. Well, so much for that plan. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ailín Ó’S Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ailín Ó’S Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity 😂 Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in São Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical​advanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Renan Magnetic cards aren't the rule here, we mostly use a card with a contact-chip (and the magnetic stripe, but I've never used it) that looks a lot like a SIM card chip. And I don't even know how a Contactless symbol looks like :P Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT. Fingers crossed. 4Ui812 Off topic but , Trini women are hot. xyz This is the sort of comment that is better to keep in your head and not actually post. Disqusman Trinidad and Tobago?!!

See Offers Nation & World Posted May 5 Updated May 5 increase font size Hear, hear: Voice-activated gadgets may not speak well for security Those gizmos can be more than just annoying; they can put you at risk. By MAE ANDERSONAssociated Press Share Comment Read Article NEW YORK — Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention – not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain’s 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said “OK, Google” and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger’s ingredients in homes around the country – effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout “OK, Google, stop!” Having only debuted in 2015, Amazon's Echo Dot is still experiencing growing pains even as it grows in popularity. But the next generation of voice assistants may come with better security, including individual voice recognition and even image recognition. Associated Press/Jeff Chiu Search photos available for purchase: Photo Store → Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. “It’s a wakeup call,” said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase “OK, Google” reportedly set off people’s devices. And in a January story that turned a family into media celebrities, a woman’s 6-year-old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new – the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year – they’re still having growing pains. And they’re growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn’t release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. “Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,” Forrester analyst James McQuivey said. “Very few brands want to do that.” Of course, spammers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can’t inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with “skills” that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Voice assistants are still in their “very early days,” Google says; the company plans to “monitor and learn as we go.” Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. “It’s not that we won’t see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don’t think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME The devices are going to need better security. “When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we’re accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,” Gartner’s Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person’s voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it’s more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six voices, though it won’t prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon’s new Echo Look has a camera, but it’s for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they’ll also create new privacy concerns. “Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,” Perkins said. “There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.” Share Read or Post Comments Were you interviewed for this story?

MediaRadar, a company that tracks advertising across the web for thousands of publishers, reported that YouTube suffered a decline in the number of Google Preferred customers in the US and Canada for the first time this year. Google Preferred is a program where advertisers can match themselves to highly trafficked videos of certain themes such as music or news. The ad-tracking firm noted that four major advertisers — Starbucks, Dish, Pepsi and AT&T — yanked their ads from YouTube. A few others, including General Motors, Verizon and Johnson & Johnson, continued stuck with YouTube despite the uproar. “Some of the exact brands that said they would stop actually did in April,” said MediaRadar CEO Todd Krizelman. “This suggests that at least some of the contraction is related to the negative press in late March.” YouTube is said to be a $12 billion business, a wildly popular video-sharing platform that is growing faster than its parent Google, the leader in global-search advertising. SEE ALSO Ad firm pulls spots from YouTube over proximity to white supremacist videos 0:0 Madison Avenue is finally putting the screws to ad-selling tech... Mizuho Securities analyst Neil Doshi calculated in March report that if advertiser defections cut into YouTube revenue by 10 percent, then Google’s parent company Alphabet’s earnings would shrink by 15 cents a share, or slightly less than 1 percent. The Times of London opened a hornet’s nest for Google after reporting in March that advertisers such as Walmart and JPMorgan were inadvertently showing up next to hate speech — a problem that is vigorously policed by marketers in traditional media. Google says it has changed its algorithms and is stopping anyone promoting hate speech from receiving ad dollars from its Adsense program. Adsense is a way for publishers to receive ad revenue when they hit certain traffic goals. But Matan Uziel — who runs a YouTube channel called Real Women, Real Stories, featuring women speaking out about unseen hardships — says Google’s technology isn’t sophisticated enough. He sent The Post a host of disgusting videos that he says YouTube has done nothing to remove. Uziel has worked with ad exec Madonna Badger, who champions positive portrayals of women in marketing. SEE ALSO Google wakes up to its White Power problem 0:0 Google boss Larry Page is beginning to sweat. The search... “[They] don’t know the difference between videos that are fighting the issues and videos that are from actual people who celebrate gender-based violence,” he told The Post. Uziel, based in Israel, says there are many examples of violence against children still hosted by YouTube. Last week, Google reported ad revenue of $17.4 billion in its latest quarter, up 71 percent versus the year-ago quarter. The most recent quarter didn’t include April. Speaking at the YouTube Brandcast event for advertisers on Thursday, YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki said, “We apologize for letting some of you down. We can, and we will, do better.” Together Google and Facebook are predicted to bring in $106 billion — half the world’s digital ad spending — in 2017. Google alone is projected to take in $72.69 billion, according to eMarketer.

By Corazon Victorino On 05/05/17 AT 10:12 PM Close Apple’s Phil Schiller just shared his honest thoughts about the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers. He also indirectly pointed out what he thinks is lacking in these devices.  Gadgets 360 has finally published its interview with Apple’s Senior Vice President of Worldwide Marketing when he was in Bengaluru, India last March. When Schiller was asked to comment on the famous smart speakers Amazon Echo and Google Home, he responded that he won’t give specific comments on each device. He then candidly added, “My mother used to have a saying that if you don’t have something nice to say, say nothing at all.” Schiller continued by saying that he’ll just tackle the general concepts. He first pointed out that there is definitely a market for voice-driven assistants that’s why Apple is working so hard in developing and improving Siri. However, he noted that a voice assistant device without a screen is only important at times when it’s convenient to have this type of device. He set two examples to back his statement. First, he said that a device without a screen is perfect for when one is driving. Next, he stated that this technology is also useful for when one is listening to music from a device across the room because there’s the advantage of switching songs without walking over and back to the device. READ: Amazon Prime Video coming to Apple TV this year Schiller stated that there are many other times when a voice assistant device is beneficial, but he thinks that this does not mean such devices should not come with a screen display. For this, he used asking for directions as an example. The Apple executive said that while a voice assistant can say the directions out loud, it would still be better if one can see the directions on a map. “I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route and what I’m going to do,” he said.  According to Schiller, another aspect where the voice-only assistants fail is photography. Voice assistants could never work with this application because photography requires a screen nowadays. He linked this downside to social media saying, “All the social networking apps… are now embracing photos more and more.” He also said, “The idea of a device without a screen, well it’s not really useful for that whole category of photos that we all share.” Lastly, Schiller tackled the disadvantage of voice-only devices when it comes to gaming. “The biggest category of all of apps is games, and I have yet to see any voice-only games that, for me, are nearly as fun as the one that I play on my screen,” he said. Because of this, he firmly believes that the role of the screen is very important in the tech industry, and it will remain that way.  READ: Apple Pay updated with 21 more U.S. banks While Schiller’s comments are vague, AppleInsider reports that they could be providing insight as to what Apple is planning for its voice assistant technology long-term. At present, the Cupertino giant is rumored to be working on a Siri-based smart speaker that would surely be a direct competitor to the Amazon Echo and Google Home. Details about the device are scarce, but it’s not that hard to imagine that it would feature a display given Schiller’s sentiments.  Phil Schiller gave his honest thoughts on the Amazon Echo and Google Home smart speakers.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 134 Plus 1 on G+ 316 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares534 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 143k 114k Latest Deals 20 [Deal Alert] Runtastic Road Bike Pro is free on the Play Store (down from $4.99) 2017/05/06 1:33am PDTMay 6, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 18 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks, Daniel Brierton and Ailín Ó'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>  // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>  // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>  // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>  // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It’s as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let’s try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They’re not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded. This needs to be completed for Visual ID to work</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_button">Try upload again</string> <string name="handsfree_checkin_notification_title">Checking In</string> <string name="handsfree_checkin_notification_text">This is needed for Hands Free Loyalty to work</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_title">Identifying you near checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_location_text">Visual ID uses Bluetooth and other signals from your phone to detect your location.</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_location_title">Knowing you're near a store</string> <string name="handsfree_consent_text_privacy_text">When Visual ID confirms your identity, Google sends your loyalty info to the store, but does not share any other info about you. You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing – picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize – it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ailín Ó’S And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ailín Ó’S No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though 😂😅 ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI 😩 Ailín Ó’S They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it 😂 Ailín Ó’S The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to €, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Dang. Well, so much for that plan. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ailín Ó’S Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ailín Ó’S Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity 😂 Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in São Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical​advanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Renan Magnetic cards aren't the rule here, we mostly use a card with a contact-chip (and the magnetic stripe, but I've never used it) that looks a lot like a SIM card chip. And I don't even know how a Contactless symbol looks like :P Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT. Fingers crossed. 4Ui812 Off topic but , Trini women are hot. xyz This is the sort of comment that is better to keep in your head and not actually post. Disqusman Trinidad and Tobago?!!

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Access a Web Page When It’s Down By Chris Hoffman on May 5th, 2017 Nothing ever vanishes completely from the Internet. Whether a web page has been down for a few minutes or a few years, there are a few ways you can view its content anyway. Option One: Google Cache Google and other search engines download and keep copies of the web pages they index. if a web page is down, you can easily view the most recent copy cached by Google. If you’re trying to access a web page from Google search, it’s easy to access the cached copy. Just click the back button in your web browser when the web page doesn’t load. Click the arrow to the right of the web page’s address, and click “Cached” to view the old copy. If the page appears to be taking a long time to load, you can click the “Text-only version” link at the top of the cached page. The web page will load instantly, but you won’t see any images. This is necessary when the website’s server is down and your browser can’t load the web page’s images. You’ll also see the date and time when Google created this cached copy displayed at the top of the page. There’s also quick way to view Google’s cached copy of any web page without going through Google search first. Just plug the following address into your address bar, replacing example.com/page.htm with the full address of the web page you want to view. http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:example.com/page.htm Be sure to omit the “http://” or “https://” from the start of the web page’s address if you do this. So, if you wanted to view the cached copy of https://www.howtogeek.com/226280/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10/ , you’d type: http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:www.howtogeek.com/226280/how-to-take-screenshots-in-windows-10/ While we focused on Google Cache here because most people use Google, Microsoft’s Bing search engine has its own similar feature. If you use Bing, you can click the  down arrow to the right of an address and click “Cached page” to view a copy from Bing’s cache. Option Two: The Wayback Machine The Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine also allows you to view older copies of a web page. Where Google Cache only offers you a single, most recent cached copy, the Wayback Machine offers multiple older versions of a web page going back much further, so you can see what a web page looked like years ago To use the Wayback Machine, head to the Wayback Machine page. Plug the full address of the web page you want to view into the box and click “Browse History”. For example, you can copy and paste this address from your browser’s address bar if a web page doesn’t load. If you just want to view the most recently cached copy of a web page, you can click the date at the top of the archive page. If you want an older copy, you can select a year and click a date on the calendar to view the web page as it appeared on that date. You can click links that appear on the page after it loads to view other web pages as they appeared on that date. This tool allows you to browse entire websites that have disappeared or changed dramatically. You may also have heard of CoralCDN in the past. CoralCDN was particularly useful for viewing cached copies of web pages that went down due to sudden high traffic. However, CoralCDN is now shut down. The above two tools should get you pretty far, though. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (1 REPLY) Got Feedback?

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) FILE - In this Tuesday, Oct. 4, 2016, file photo, Google Home, right, sits on display near a Pixel phone following a product event, in San Francisco. Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple’s Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. Burger King’s manipulation of Google Home illustrates the vulnerabilities intrinsic to voice assistants that can be targeted by brands, or worse, hackers. But the stunt might help speed up the next developments for home voice assistants: individual voice recognition and even image recognition. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File) Single page Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (2) New York • Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention — not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain's 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said "OK, Google" and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger's ingredients in homes around the country — effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout "OK, Google, stop!" VIDEOS TOP JOBS Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. "It's a wakeup call," said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. "It's a harbinger of things to come." TRIGGER WARNING Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple's Siri and Amazon's Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase "OK, Google" reportedly set off people's devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman's 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon's voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new — the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year — they're still having growing pains. And they're growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn't release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. "Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage," Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. "Very few brands want to do that." Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. THREATS AND COUNTERMEASURES Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can't inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with "skills" that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their "very early days," Google says; the company plans to "monitor and learn as we go." Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. "It's not that we won't see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don't think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime," said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. MORE SECURITY TO COME But before long, the devices are going to need better security. "When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we're accustomed to, related to security for computers, change," Gartner's Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. » Next page...

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.  The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you’re updating an existing app or building something new, we’ve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing. It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat.

I was not informed when I got it nor when I lost it. There were no clear rules who gets it. I also didn't see any marketing advantage (it didn't bring me more downloads). Chainfire XDA Same here. I did not ask to get it, and I did not ask to lose it. I did find it a bit odd to lose my badge with million upon millions of users and several apps with 4.0+ or even 4.5+ average ratings, while review-buyers and the likes retained theirs, but *shrug*.

The report raises the question of whether Alphabet needs to buy a company to help Google make some inroads with enterprise customers. By Tiernan Ray Updated May 5, 2017 8:33 p.m. ET Text Size Regular Medium Large Goldman Sachs analysts Heather Bellini and Heath Terry, and colleagues today issued an interesting report that summarizes points from a discussion about cloud computing that has implications for Alphabet (GOOGL). The authors spoke with RightScale, a firm that helps enterprises make the transition to cloud computing. RightScale CEO Michael Crandall told them about the trends his customers, and their views on Google, on Microsoft’s (MSFT) Azure cloud service, and on Amazon (AMZN). One takeaway the authors had was that Google’s cloud service is still “far behind Amazon and Azure.” sThat’s based on the fact that RightScale only 15% of customers report having used Google. That’s up from 10% a year earlier, but far below the 60% or so who report having used Amazon, and the 30% who report having used Azure. Crandall told the analysts that Google has “the simplest and most cost-effective structure” for public cloud computing, which allows people to save money with things like “continued-use discounts." However, Crandall tells Goldman that "in order to be successful, GCP must fully embrace the push into enterprise,” referring to Google’s cloud service, "potentially through an acquisition that would provide it with greater access into the enterprise market." "Specifically, he believes that the acquisition of a managed service provider or system integrator could make sense to add enterprise credibility, moreso than the acquisition of a cloud application."

Skip to content Naked Security Computer Security News, Advice and Research sophos.com Free Tools Go Award-winning computer security news Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Feed Update: Google Docs used for phishing? Not exactly 04 May 2017 11 Google, Malware, Phishing Post navigation Previous: NSA kept an eye on 151m phone records – but wait, didn’t bulk collection stop three years ago? Next: Have you got what it takes to hack the US Air Force? by Bill Brenner 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Updated Friday, May 5, 6:55 AM London time, with comments from Sophos principal research scientist Chester Wisniewski Since news began circulating last night of a phishing campaign parading around as Google Doc access links, the tale has taken strange twists and turns. A self-described graduate student claims he was behind the blast of emails, and that they were part of a test for a school project, not a phishing attack. But according to the university he claims to be enrolled at, he’s not a student there. Meanwhile, as the hours pass, it becomes less clear if what Google users received was truly a phishing attempt. Sophos principal research scientist Chester Wisniewski says it wasn’t, exactly: First and foremost, this is an abuse of Google’s APIs. While at first glance it appears to be a phishing attack, the emails come from Google and you are logging into the real Google. Last night, news and social media sites were ablaze with word of a new phishing campaign using fake Google Doc sharing emails to lure its prey, arriving in messages like this: Those clicking the link got a Google login and permissions page asking that they grant the fake Docs app the ability to “read, send, delete and manage your email” as well as manage your contacts: Rather than coming from the real Google Docs, this came from a bogus app called “Google Docs.” Later, someone calling himself Eugene Pupov took to Twitter claiming he sent the emails to test a program created for a graduate final. It was in no way designed as a phishing attack, he said: Cries of phishing At the time of writing, Pupov hadn’t returned messages seeking comment (if he responds, we’ll update this article). But his tweets expressed despair over the state of affairs. This story was carried by news outlets large and small, with ominous headlines about phishing attacks disguised as Google Doc access emails. Google itself confirmed it was investigating phishing attempts last night: Twitter was full of messages from people who received such messages. On the surface, it appears folks realized quickly that something wasn’t right with these links: Google acted quickly, announcing steps users could take if they had indeed clicked on the link: Wisniewski said it’s ultimately Google’s responsibility to stop these sorts of threats: Attacks on systems that are open for anyone to sign up as a developer using OAuth have been vulnerable to this type of attack for a long time, and the onus is on Google to do a better job vetting application developers. This is no different than the abuse of the Google Play store by malware authors. There is very little individuals can do other than be forever suspicious about legitimate requests from services provided by Google, Twitter, Facebook and other online services that use OAuth with an un-vetted application developer program. Twitter’s users were attacked using these techniques a few years back. Unfortunately, Google has also fallen victim to a similar attack vector. When users see official emails from Google and official login pages used in scams, this leads the goodwill Google has garnered from its users to be potentially damaged. All providers of OAuth have a responsibility to police the use of their platforms to stop users from being tricked through official requests from services like Google, Twitter and Facebook. We do suggest that users keep an eye on social media. As the Google Doc “phishing” attempt demonstrates, Twitter is a great early-warning system. There’s little doubt that the tweeted warnings saved people from being victimized. Is he for real? It remains to be seen if Pupov’s claims are genuine. An email we sent to his gmail account promptly bounced back, and we’re still waiting for him to respond to our questions via Twitter. One question we have: what was the exact purpose of his project? Other security experts, meanwhile, have pointed out that Pupov’s claims have not yet been independently verified. According to Coventry University, he’s not registered as a student there: What to do? The question, after all this, is what users should do to protect themselves. If this were a cut-and-dry phishing attempt, our tips would be to: Be careful what you click. This one is painfully obvious, but users need a constant reminder. Check the address bar for the correct URL. The address bar in your web browser uses a URL to find the website you are looking for. The web address usually starts with either HTTP or HTTPS, followed by the domain name. The real websites of banks and many others use a secure connection that encrypts web traffic, called SSL or HTTPS. If you are expecting a secure HTTPS website for your bank, for example, make sure you see a URL beginning with https://before entering your private information. Look for the padlock for secure HTTPS websites. A secure HTTPS website has a padlock icon to the left of the web address. Consider using two-factor authentication for more security. When you try to log into a website with two-factor authentication (2FA), there’s an extra layer of security to make sure it’s you signing into your account. Keep an eye on Twitter: As the Google Doc phishing attempt demonstrates, Twitter is a great early-warning system. There’s little doubt that the tweeted warnings saved people from being victimized. Since the details around what happened remain confused, it doesn’t hurt to take additional steps. For example, if someone believes they may have inadvertently downloaded a sketchy app, they can go to myaccount.google.com/permissions and revoke permissions for any apps they don’t trust. Wisniewski added: Users should check the apps they have approved to access their accounts and remove anything that may be suspicious on all OAuth-based platforms. For Google it is under your Google account -> Sign-in & Security -> Connected apps & sites. On Twitter and Facebook it is Settings & Privacy -> Apps.

Not exactly” John says: May 4, 2017 at 1:06 pm The account Eugene Pupov on twitter was only created this month, with the first tweet being that stating it was a test. The original profile picture was associated with someone completely different, which is now not associated with the twitter profile. It is unlikely this was a test. Reply Bill Brenner says: May 4, 2017 at 2:42 pm I share your skepticism, especially since Coventry University messaged me that he’s not really a student there. Reply Mahhn says: May 4, 2017 at 2:58 pm Do you think the tweets were to make people less responsive to cleaning up it’s dirty work? giving the impression it might be nondestructive Reply Bill Brenner says: May 4, 2017 at 3:01 pm That is certainly possible. Also possible is that this person was looking for attention. I doubt that, though. Reply Mahhn says: May 4, 2017 at 2:52 pm I only know of one person that fell for this, a coworkers mate at a different employer. Glad management gets to see the value in us blocking all public storage. Reply Wilderness says: May 5, 2017 at 12:44 am “Glad management gets to see the value in us blocking all public storage” That’s fantastic! Reply Edward says: May 5, 2017 at 5:03 am Except that google hasn’t fixed the vulnerability to completely spoof the omnibar and make the URL appear legit as well. At least the guy didn’t inject it with ransomware that would of been the most destructive attack in history I would imagine. Reply Keith Hanson (@keith_hanson) says: May 5, 2017 at 9:11 pm This really didn’t do much at all. I know it seems like all the facts are pointing skeptically at this new user posting the story, but the code itself (my team and I dove into it after I got caught up in it) seemed amateur, rushed, and didn’t actually do much at all with the power it held. Those facts seem to me to corroborate the student story. As for the student not being in their database – would you admit to the world under your real name as a college student? I sincerely doubt it. Reply John says: May 5, 2017 at 9:50 pm If it were an evil person instead of a student, they have a huge number of contact lists now and a huge number of email addresses. That alone would be worth $$$$ Reply Mario583 says: May 6, 2017 at 12:15 am Mailinator is used as a spam email that can ONLY receive never send. Reply Paul Ducklin says: May 6, 2017 at 11:29 am The mailinator address in the worm email is the To: address, not the From:, so that address *is* receiving, not sending. You get your copy of the email via BCC. Therefore the crook gets to keep track of how this thing is spreading. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks, Daniel Brierton and Ailín Ó'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>  // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>  // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>  // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>  // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It’s as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let’s try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They’re not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing – picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize – it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other.

Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ailín Ó’S And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ailín Ó’S No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though 😂😅 ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI 😩 Ailín Ó’S They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it 😂 Ailín Ó’S The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to €, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Dang. Well, so much for that plan. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ailín Ó’S Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ailín Ó’S Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity 😂 Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in São Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical​advanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Renan Magnetic cards aren't the rule here, we mostly use a card with a contact-chip (and the magnetic stripe, but I've never used it) that looks a lot like a SIM card chip. And I don't even know how a Contactless symbol looks like :P Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT. Fingers crossed. 4Ui812 Off topic but , Trini women are hot. xyz This is the sort of comment that is better to keep in your head and not actually post. Disqusman Trinidad and Tobago?!!

LG G6 already down to $500 at T-Mobile, plus free Google Home and G Pad X tablet Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/03 11:16am PDTMay 3, 2017 29 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 46 Share on Twitter Total Shares154 G6 LG News T-Mobile Just the other day we noticed that LG's G6 was $600 at B&H, and now the month-old flagship is down to $500 at T-Mobile. The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H, but, for those of you on the magenta carrier, it is $100 less and comes with a free G Pad X. You can even use it to take advantage of LG's current promo and pick up a Google Home. $500 for a phone, tablet, and Google Home is a pretty sweet deal if the $800 GS8 and its curvy screen doesn't appeal to you. I hope these rapid drops in price aren't a sign of trouble for LG, but in the meantime, they do serve consumers pretty well. The G6 was well regarded in our review. We found the screen to be a pretty great IPS panel if that's your preference. Battery life was also decent, and the size and feel of the phone both struck us well. If you're interested in trying out the future of flagship aspect ratios and rounded screens, the G6 is a decent way to go. The promotion for a free Google Home ($114 right now) sweetens the deal pretty well, too. All these offers have a couple of small caveats you should keep in mind if you're interested in picking up a free Google Home and G Pad X with your G6. For the Google Home you have to order your phone by May 7th, which is just a few days away, and you have to submit your registration for the promo online by the 22nd. The G Pad X requires that you hold a plan through T-Mobile with at least 2GB of data, and keep your service for 24 months. The precise terms and conditions are available at the links below.

Marty Not for a 32GB one these days. A flagship with last gen SoC, no quad DAC and the smallest memory. Simon Are you concerned by this? I'm not sure since you made only 3 comments in 3 minutes about it. Marty Yeah, I don't sound too concerned. But it's a concern. 😉 needa Making my third in three minutes here so you can see my concern also. needa $500 is the right price with those specs. Home is the bonus. Marty Get a Oneplus 3T. 128GB and SD821. Plus it has 6GB RAM. Mine works beautifully. And it's gorgeous. All for $480. needa Yeah but still have the screen and the cameras. I'd buy the 3T in a heartbeat over this. But I don't care that much about the 128. Most I ever had on my 64 OPO over the three years was thirty'ish. Deleted ten gb in roms and was back in action. Mike Not waterproof, much worse camera, update support is a giant question mark, screen is lower quality. One is a true flagship the other is a mid ranger and it shows. Marty What's wrong with the display? Mine's already updated to 7.1.1. And there's a plethora of software options in Beta. And the camera makes beatiful pics. It loads as fast as any Samsung camera. Mike If you're going to talk about current flagship specs, a screen from flagships released, what, two or three years ago doesn't make sense. Also, the OnePlus 2/X still hasn't seen Nougat, OnePlus has yet to prove they can continue with support for older devices. Marty Perfectly fine and beautiful display. It looks better than the display in my Nexus 6P. Bob Marley Except it's not. The pixel density on the OP3T display is effectively the same as the iPhone 7 due to the Pentile subpixel layout. If you have even average vision, the lack of sharpness is apparent, especially on text. Marty It looks gorgeous to me. And quantity isnt quality. needa The OPO ended with the November 2016 security patch. That is all of your fingers and toes, in months, plus a few more. They are lagging behind with the 2/x... no doubt. But they have proven support for older devices. More than some other mainstream OEMs. And with that... I have exceeded my maximum number of comments on a page by about six. See yall later. P. Sherman Sony released Nougat to Xperia Z5 and Z3+. They were released around the same time OnePlus 2 was released. Their attitude to OnePlus 2 and their users is beyond pathetic. needa Not denying they aren't behind. And not denying that they should throw the OP2 users a bone. But you can't use one example and generalize the company. Every single OEM has had their flagship that didn't get updated at a reasonable rate, or updated at all. "The beta test is over". needa hmm. ATT s6 just now getting nougat. I know I know. Oneplus is the worst. They released a new phone only few months after the s6 was released... and It DOesn't HAVe NOUGat YET? Omg. The travesty. Samsung must have been cracking the whip on their 'small team' of developers. tl;dr. It will all be ok. Life will go on. Marty Ohh...by the way, my G5 is on Android 6.0.1 with no sign of any future update. My G4 is on Android 6 and also with no sign of any future update. I'd say LG is worse than any of them for updates. YaKillaCJ You sound dense to me. OnePlus has a amoled display. Nor has LG when it comes to updates.OnePlus however has learned big time from their mistakes, openly said it and proving it. Another huge benefit is being completely open source, which means the OnePlus 3 will be running Android Q due to community support. Much how OnePlus One is running Nougat, released with KitKat. Mike Just having an "Amoled display" doesn't mean that the display is good and I was more referencing the fact that it's a 1080p panel when Marty was talking about phones using last years specs. Being Open Source is a benefit to a select few, the majority of the Android world isn't going to know what a ROM is and on the official channel, none of OnePlus' devices before the 3 have Nougat yet. I'm not saying LG is any better with updates but you can't overlook OnePlus' past with updates when looking to buy one of their phones. YaKillaCJ Yes maybe not better but neither is "better" and this is very much user preference. Me for example, I prefer Amoled and 1080p because battery life. Open source isn't a factor to the average person but it's definitely a big benefit to have in your back pocket as they say. As far as past, this works against LG. They have released probably 100 headsets over the years, only 10 gets half decent support. Vs OnePlus who released 5 devices and 3 of which has gotten better support than all of LG offerings. Both have their hardware controversy, as do every OEM. OnePlus open thrives to do better. While LG sticks the head in the sand until they getting a class action lawsuit. Every Flagship since LG-G4 will "eventually" bootloop apparently. needa But the majority of the peeps owning an OP2 had to get an invite first. OnePlus owners cannot be lumped into "the majority of the Android world". Not yet at least. needa 1080 vs 2k isn't about the quality. The 3T has a killer screen. Can't say anything about their support as the OPO that I finally sat down two days ago is still working as good as the day I got it. Just a bit long in the tooth. ie. three years of charging and hindered by the tech back then. Marty Thank you. Exactly. Resolution isn't a factor in quality just like MPs are a factor in picture quality. Leticiacmadrigal Google is paying 97$ per hour!

It's the best mid ranger around but if you can spend the extra $100 or $200 you will get a much better phone. But of course, people spend money on their phones so they will do everything in their power to convince themselves it is a perfect device so me spitting out facts is basically like banging my head against a wall. Oh, and I own neither device, I've held and used both but don't have a horse in either race. southerndinner Terrible support, never gets updated, incredibly unethical company, no IP rating and poor screen quality. I don't care much for LG but this is a way better deal than the 3T Marty What about my LG G4 and G5 that never get updated? My Oneplus 3T is on Android 7.1.1. The display is gorgeous and better looking than the display in my Nexus 6P. But let me guess, you're one of those people who equates screen quality with pixel resolution? If so, you probably determine a camera's quality based on its pixel count. Mike The 3T screen uses a resolution from flagships phones released in 2013. You mention that the CPU in the G6 is basically worthless since it's from last year but completely overlook other specs the phone has from years ago. Way to only grab the specs that back up your side, while blatantly ignoring others. Marty LG had a choice. If they chose to run with a last gen SoC they could have compensated for it by stuffing the G6 with a bunch of goodies like extra large storage and the quad DAC. But they didn't. There's nothing wrong with the SD821, but it is last gen. The 3T uses the SD821 but has quadruple the storage size for less cost than the G6 at a discount. Mike Storage size means so little these days with expandable storage being a thing. Unless you are downloading twenty 1 GB apps, you'll be fine. Some people may need more but the vast majority don't after buying a $20 64 GB SD card. The G6 is slightly more expensive but offers real world improvements such as a better main shooter, a wide angle shooter, and waterproofing over the OnePlus. So they chose to make the phone more usable over adding a better DAC that most of the US probably could care less about and if they do will go with the similarly priced V20. Either way, the 3T seems like a loss unless you are on a strict budget or don't care about mobile photography. Marty No, expandable storage sucks super bad for using as app storage. Theres a lot of disadvantage to it. It's fine for pictures, videos, music etc, though, but it isn't the same as internal storage. You're not considering the fact that the user doesn't get 32GB of actual internal storage on a 32GB device. The system takes up a considerable amount of that 32GB. And I know all too well how bad it feels not having ample space for apps and various media related projects on my devices. I love having 100GB of free user storage on my 3T. I can install app and games to my heart's desire without fretting of running out of space. Mike The phone doesn't work for you (As you've stated many times), we get it, the S7/Edge was one of the best selling phones with only 32 GB of storage last year so I don't think the general public cares nor sees it as a selling point. LG went with the majority of people looking to buy their phones not the one person online looking to install every trending app on their phone. Marty Yeah, okay. Say hi to LG for us all as they continue to languish and remain in Samsung's shadow...lol. I really hope for LG's sake you aren't any kind of decision maker for them. They'd do well to can your a ss. 😉 Mike As I said previously, I have no horse in this race. I've owned LG, Samsung, Nexii, and HTC devices and every time I go to purchase a phone I look at the landscape and go from there. Your original argument was that the OnePlus 3T was a vastly better buy than the G6. My reasoning is that (In my opinion) you get better real world features in the G6 over the OnePlus that's all. Sorry I bothered you so much. Marty I don't know where you get "vastly" from, certainly not me. But the 3T, from what I'm experiencing with it, it is definitely a better buy than the G6. I own a G5 that can't compete with the 3T. My G4 and G5 both exhibit lag and sluggishness in various ways whereas my 3T is snappy and quick. Both of my LGs act like they really don't want to get out of bed when I tap to wake them up. My 3T acts like it's raring and ready to go when I tap to wake it up. In fact, out of all the devices I own...a substantial bunch...only my LGs are sluggish about waking up. Marty And by the way, the rest of what you said sounds arrogant as all h ell. You seem to be speaking for all US users. You know what? F *ck LG. They've seen the last penny from this US user. You're arrogant attitude promoted me saying that. Mike Sorry you feel that way, I don't care what phone you buy to be honest. If by bundling the US into one segment makes me sound arrogant then so be it, but when you release one phone a year you have to go with the majority of what your users will be looking for and manage cost with that as well which is why we've never seen a perfect phone, even the S8 this year has some major flaws. On the flip side, if that's your dog in your thumbnail, it's cute as all hell. ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Marty Hey, it's no skin off my hide that LG keeps making stupid decisions year after year. They are one of the most leading smartphone makers...umm...wait... I, as a user, have much better alternatives to consider. Mike LG's stock has soared since the G6 was announced, going up 15% between the announcement and now. I guess the public likes stupid decisions. Marty Too early to tell. Give it a fiscal quarter and then make a comment. min009 So, how's beta testing for OnePlus working out? I did it with their first 2 phones. Took several months to get a stable rom after launch. Not again. Marty Don't know. I haven't indulged in the Beta testing. I'm actually fully content with how my 3T works with stock firmware. It is, though, an intriguing proposition to consider for when the device gets old and becomes secondary to newer ones. It'll be fun to play with either on Beta or custom ROMs. Jasdeep Singh The S8 effect. LG remains under Samsung's shadow! Marty Because LG makes stupid decisions. Snubbing the American market isn't wise. New_Guy Not to mention they squandered their chance to take over Android the market by constantly putting sub-par cameras in the M-line (4 Ultra Pixels......c'mon man). The only reason I got the Moto X 2014 over the M8 was because of the camera. needa Definitely the new guy. HTC New_Guy Yeah, I was trippin' there for a second....been a long g day already. needa Lol. I hear yah. I have done the same thing before. New_Guy I'd delete the comment, but whatevs.... ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Matthew Scott Smith I didn't see a mention of HTC in the above comments, but HTC is doing much worse than LG presently. New_Guy Yeah, I sort of lost myself there for a moment...been a long day, haha ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The S8 trumps the G6. Sammy got LG running like a scalded dog illregal Trumps it in what.. Not in usability, software smoothness, or camera. Tom Ireland http://www.greenbot.com/article/3194527/android/samsung-sweetens-galaxy-s8-purchases-with-6-months-of-netflix-other-goodies.html#tk.rss_all BC LG will eternally be the second and sometimes third best, as their poor choices are constantly going to make their phones less appealing. The gimped USA version had been a nonstarter to me, Smartworld is a POS...I didn't want to deal with that after the LG V20, which even after a factory reset started to become janky. I just wish LG would step up their game and become competition to Samsung. LG needs to freshen up their Android Skin, continue to work on their features and software. BigDeeNY99 exactly why i dont rush anymore to purchase the new next best phone.. Eric Vaughan Also comes with the LG G Pad X 8.0? Seems like a good deal. Marty LG disgusts me. Always skimping for the US market. 32GB max and no quad DAC. illregal Korea gets a 6gb ram 128gb S8. But just completely ignore that.. Marty No, Samsung snubs us too. Especially with updates. Buy a non carrier branded US market Samsung phone and forget about updates. Buy an international version and get updates, but no Samsung Pay. If you want updates and SP you have to invest in a carrier locked version. Screw Samsung. I'm going Oneplus, Huawei, ZTE and other Chinese brands...or Apple. balthazar The model T-Mobile is selling might not be the same version you can get from B&H[...] What are the differences? Ryne Hager T-Mobile has a more limited set of frequencies listed for their model, and B&H has the unlocked model that supports a pretty broad range. I can't be sure that the T-Mobile version is locked or unlocked or supports any frequencies outside what T-Mobile lists. Justin W Usually T-Mobile locks their network support. You can temporarily unlock, or permanent unlock, but that depends on your standing with the company. Well, unless this time around is different - the V20 I just picked up has those stipulations in place. Rod Flop much? Sohit will this work on Verizon? Margaritas Ante Porcos Great deal indeed. Although even in my medieval country g6 goes for around $600 bucks. Samsungs will drop s8 prices soon. Only few crazy nerds are buying those phones for 800. Suicide_Note A few thousand buy LG's wares, while millions have already bought the S8/S8+, and I'm sure they're not all 'nerds' as you put it. MRIANB Wow, LG is desperate and phone must not be selling against S8. Ryan Bartz Aside from the iPhone no phone can compete with Samsung. Samsung releases a respectable phone with half backed software (nothing has changed) and people forget about LG which is a damn good no gimmick phone Tom Ireland I guess Samsung has another reason for more goodies? http://www.greenbot.com/article/3194527/android/samsung-sweetens-galaxy-s8-purchases-with-6-months-of-netflix-other-goodies.html#tk.rss_all I think you could take a differing position on any add-ons a company offers. Martin Watched couple videos on YouTube and the phone is pretty damn good. And this deal is pretty sweet. Wish I was in US... Here butt naked G6 is $650.... :) TechGuy22 299 and i'd buy it Marty Same for me. At that price point, not having the quad DAC and the small memory doesn't hurt too bad. sebastianer If they are powered with random bootlooping technology… I'm totally in. Arysyn While I'm not a fan of the LG G6, this isn't a bad price, especially for what is included. It would be an even better deal if priced to go against the ZTE Axon 7, as the G6 still is a much better device, despite the features I think LG ought to have included in the G6. JD At this rate you might as well just get right to where the G6 will end up. You get a free boot-looping G6 with the purchase of every Google Home. Mike The Galaxy S8 forced the markdown J_Grouchy The "free" tablet ($240 value) requires a $10/month data plan for 24 months. Funny how that math works... Mike in KC Now throw in a BOGO deal on top of that price and I'm in. southerndinner LOL in the bargain bin already RIP LG Mobile PhillipeFelut the V20 and G6 are 50% off on at&t next as well fyi DroidBlaze I'm still liking my s7e but if the US g6 had 64gb and the quad dac I would have seriously considered getting it. As is, the US g6 is just meh. calvini Just got the G6 from AT&T for $360 with the free tablet and I also had the option of getting the LG Smart watch for $50. Registered on LGs website to get the free Google home as well. I believe this promo lasts this whole month, but to be eligible for the Google home, you need to purchase the phone before the 7th of May. Not a bad deal at all through AT&T. Edit: must sign up for "Next" payments. 30 months @ $12 or 24 months @ $15 illregal Everyone talking like they are scared of the S8.. No, not at all. They are scared of what HTC is about to unleash. The real flagship phone for 2017. steadymobb Bahahaha. Damn I was already in a good mood because it's Friday but this gave me a good laugh. Thanks!

Android Pay v1.22 prepares Visual ID facial recognition based on Hands Free and reveals testing for Brazil, Trinidad & Tobago, and Canada [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 1:23pm PDTMay 5, 2017 46 Plus 1 on G+ 31 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares127 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 New Currencies 1.2 Hands Free returns as Visual ID 1.3 Testing and error reporting tools 2 Download Android Pay may not have had a massive launch, or has it been as aggressively rolled out as Samsung Pay, but it is steadily setting up shop in more countries around the globe. If you don't happen to find yourself in one of the dozen countries that have either already seen a launch or at least have an official promise of one coming soon, you might be interested to know that Google has at least set its sights on a few other countries. Text in the latest update of the Android Pay app hints at four previously unannounced markets. There are also obvious signs Google is merging the recently closed Hands Free experiment into Android Pay and expanding it significantly. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. New Currencies The evidence for this one comes in the form of a new list of currency codes. Most of them relate to countries where Android Pay is already active, or at least Google has already said it will be soon. However, four of them belong to countries that haven't been officially announced yet. The list of currencies includes: Brazilian Real Trinidad & Tobago Dollar Irish Pound Canadian Dollar Correction: Ireland was added in December 2016. I was using an incorrect source list that was missing the rollout to AIB, KBC, and Ulster Bank. Thanks, Daniel Brierton and Ailín Ó'S. Of course, a teardown already told us last year that Canada is on the list, but Google hasn't actually taken the plunge to publicly commit. The other three are new. Rumors have circulated about all of them, particularly Brazil, which has been more officially mentioned by companies involved with the rollout of NFC-based payment terminals. Nevertheless, there haven't been any official statements about expansion into these countries by Google. Currency Codes <string-array name="currency_code"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>USD</item> <item>GBP</item> <item>SGD</item> <item>AUD</item> <item>HKD</item> <item>BRL</item>  // Brazilian Real <item>TTD</item>  // Trinidad & Tobago Dollar <item>PLN</item> <item>IEP</item>  // Irish pound <item>CAD</item>  // Canadian Dollar <item>JPY</item> <item>NZD</item> <item>OTHER</item> </string-array> This list doesn't appear to actually serve a purpose for regular users. Rather, it appears to be a tool for testers that need to switch currencies while working with payment terminals. As such, I'm not so sure the list won't be removed in the future, but at least it gives us some insight into what's coming. Unfortunately, it also doesn't tell us when to expect a launch in these new locales. Naturally, we'll keep an eye out for new information as it becomes available. A quick note about currencies: I copied Google's names for the currency codes directly. It's possible the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for IEP to be the Irish Pound, but may be using it as a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Hands Free returns as Visual ID Many people probably didn't pay much attention to the Hands Free trial Google launched in and around its home base last year. To summarize, it's basically a new way to complete an in-person transaction without using a phone or card. Actually, you still need your phone with you because it relies on the various technologies that make up location services (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS); but Instead of tapping it to a payment terminal, customers say "I'll pay with Google" and give their initials to the cashier, then their identity is confirmed using a camera and Google's facial recognition technology. A couple of months ago, the pilot program for Hands Free was shuttered, but Google left it with a somewhat promising message that hinted it wasn't really dead. Now it's clear why the message was so upbeat: Google is rolling Hands Free into Android Pay. It appears the feature will be branded Visual ID. code <string name="handsfree_landing_text1">It’s as simple as snapping a picture</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text2">A camera will recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_text3">Your points will be applied automatically</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title">Never miss out on points again</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title1">One-time setup</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title2">Works like magic</string> <string name="handsfree_landing_title3">Just pay &amp; go</string> <string name="handsfree_learn_more">Learn more about Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_title">Visual ID</string> <string name="handsfree_skip_button_title">Skip</string> <string name="handsfree_turn_on_button">Turn on</string> <string name="handsfree_welcome_button">See how it works</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_title">Snap a picture of yourself</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_setup_subtitle">This will help Android Pay recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_title">Visual ID uses location &amp; Bluetooth</string> <string name="handsfree_permissions_text">Make sure you have both turned on so that Android Pay can recognize you at the register</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_subtitle">Make sure the photo clearly shows your face with no one else in the frame</string> <string name="handsfree_photo_error_title">Let’s try that again</string> Google promises to keep privacy intact by never sharing your picture with the merchant and deleting any images taken by its cameras within the store. Obviously, that doesn't impact the store's own cameras. <string name="handsfree_consent_text_identity_text">Google creates and stores a face template based on the photo you save during setup. When you're at a participating store, Visual ID will automatically confirm your identity using facial recognition technology (your face template is compared to the image captured by the in-store Visual ID camera). Images captured by the in-store Visual ID camera can't be accessed by the store and are deleted shortly after they're captured. They’re not stored or saved.</string> Also worth noting is that this doesn't prevent customers from enjoying their loyalty cards. Google will also match stored membership cards with the merchant and automatically apply them when your identity is confirmed. code <string name="handsfree_consent_subtitle">Visual ID is a secure way to confirm your identity at participating stores, making it easier to do things like earn loyalty points and redeem rewards.</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_message">Visual ID is on and your loyalty points will be automatically applied at checkout</string> <string name="handsfree_setting_description">At participating stores, Android Pay will recognize you at the register and automatically apply your loyalty points</string> <string name="handsfree_loyalty_card_error_message">Your photo has not uploaded.

You can turn Visual ID off at any time by changing your Android Pay settings.</string> Visual ID will require a camera mounted at checkout locations in stores, which means it's probably not going to become a widespread feature anytime soon. However, if it can garner lower transaction fees from banks or offer unique benefits for stores where customers actually need truly hands-free purchasing – picture Starbucks and other places where people often carry things in and out without having time to organize – it may catch on in a few places pretty quickly. Testing and error reporting tools While it's not at all important to us as users, there were some other bits included with this release for use by testers. When issues arise during use, they can report the nature of the test and what issues came up. The "engagement type" lists the type of tests, including: Ninja Field Testing (I love this name), Smoke Testing, Country Launch Testing, and Other. I don't have much to say about the rest of it, but for those that are curious, take a look at the rest of the reporting options. code <string-array name="engagement_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Ninja Field Testing</item> <item>Smoke Testing</item> <item>Country Launch Testing</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="hiccup_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Unexpected keyguard</item> <item>Repeated keyguard</item> <item>Multiple taps required</item> <item>No hiccups</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_message"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Approved</item> <item>Decline</item> <item>Insert card</item> <item>Present one card</item> <item>Card type not accepted</item> <item>Terminal froze/crashed</item> <item>Terminal restarted</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="terminal_type"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Veriphone vx 820</item> <item>Veriphone vx 520</item> <item>Other</item> </string-array> <string-array name="user_perceived_result"> <item>Please make a selection</item> <item>Success no problems</item> <item>Success with hiccups</item> <item>Failure</item> </string-array> Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way.

Just like Samsung Pay, not every client can use it. Me included :( Mayoo something something Cana... OH WAIT ... https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jFPBQaPL5mQ/hqdefault.jpg Dáire Mooney The Irish Pound? Here in Ireland we've used the Euro since 2002, why would they add support for a dead currency? And we've already got android pay anyway... Cody Toombs I searched Google for the currency code and copied what they had listed for IEP. Perhaps the Android Pay developers don't actually mean for it to be the Irish Pound, but just using it ass a symbolic reference to the Euro when it's used in Ireland. That would make sense if there are different rules or tax laws at processing time. Daniel Brierton Also, Android Pay is already available in Ireland with AIB and KBC. Ailín Ó’S And Ulster Bank too since the other day. Cody Toombs Thanks for the heads up to both you and @Popple3:disqus. I've updated the article to clarify that Ireland isn't new. Ailín Ó’S No worries Cody. I'm still truly confused about the references to Irish Punt though 😂😅 ozone89 Meanwhile, I'm tied to BOI 😩 Ailín Ó’S They'll launch with Samsung Pay in a month or so. I'm sure of it 😂 Ailín Ó’S The reference to "Irish Pound" is bizarre. That currency which we called Punt (Irish for Pound) hasn't been in use since the early 2000s when we switched to €, and anyway, we have had Android Pay since December 2016. Bizarre. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ So, can I tape a picture of a rich person over my face, and use their credit card data and buy really expensive stuff? DavidW username checks out Matt If you steal their credit card and google account information....no. Assuming the person wouldn't ring you up if you were wearing a mask. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Dang. Well, so much for that plan. Matt It seems like installing facial recognition cameras in stores is a lot more difficult than a screen that just shows them a picture of me. It's not like they don't know what I look like - they're looking right at me. mike shwilly News articles say that Android Pay will be launched in Russia on 16th May Cody Toombs Yeah, Russia and South Korea have been confirmed either by Google, partners, or other companies involved in the rollout. They're definitely happening this year, but the dates have always been a little sloppy. I think we'll see at least a half dozen other countries by the end of the year, and maybe more. The adoption rate has been picking up. newtonfb Still waiting for Paypal to be activated.... HUEHUE BR OMG BRAZIIIIIIIL Renan Oh my god, I think I've wet my pants when I saw Brazil getting Android Pay love. God please yes! Ailín Ó’S Are NFC/Contactless terminals and Contactless debit/credit cards common in Brazil? Renan Not at all :P At least not where I live... but, to be honest, I've never asked, because I can't use even Samsung Pay (which seems to be supported here) because my old S5 doesn't seems to support it (and I'm using Lineage OS, anyway). But having support will increase interest, which will make more and more terminals to support NFC/contactless and will make contactless cards more common (or at least I hope so) Ailín Ó’S Ah, that's good Samsung Pay is there, hopefully that is encouraging Contactless take up. I suppose maybe Brazil relies a lot on the old card swipe technology and hence Samsung Pay would be of great use? When you go to pay with card don't you ever see the Contactless symbol there? I know nothing about the Brazilian payments market hence my curiosity 😂 Thalles Ferreira Look, don't know where Renan lives in Brazil, not telling he's wrong, we're the size of a continent... But in São Paulo and Rio, contactless terminals are now very common, many of them with stickers of Samsung Pay or NFC symbol. About the bank technology, it's bizarre, but Brazil uses by a decade or more the chip technology that US struggles to implement now. Here it's one of the most technical​advanced in financial market of the world (sorry about this sentence, my English ain't that good). But paying with cell phone is awkward for most people here... It looks like a Jetsons future lol. But there are banks taking the next step, removing physical use of banks (only auto terminals) or changing the old numeric password for biometrics, not only in the app but in the terminals too. If you have other questions, I'm glad to explain, as I love the theme lol Renan Magnetic cards aren't the rule here, we mostly use a card with a contact-chip (and the magnetic stripe, but I've never used it) that looks a lot like a SIM card chip. And I don't even know how a Contactless symbol looks like :P Fernando Pena Actually, they are pretty common. Most credit card terminals in Brasil are NFC supported these days (those from CIELO, REDE etc), they usually have a symbol near the screen that indicates it's supported. But many people don't know that... I have friends that use NFC payments all the time, from banks like "Banco do Brasil". Fernando Pena I really hope Nubank is related to this Android Pay initiative in Brasil. They are promising this for quite some time (maybe a year by now) and I use their card A LOT. Fingers crossed. 4Ui812 Off topic but , Trini women are hot. xyz This is the sort of comment that is better to keep in your head and not actually post. Disqusman Trinidad and Tobago?!!

After several years of service, the Google Play Top Developer program is being put to rest Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/05 3:20pm PDTMay 5, 2017 26 Plus 1 on G+ 40 Share on Facebook 51 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News The Top Developers program launched several years ago as a method of drawing attention to devs who put out great apps. We all started seeing the little blue arrow badge next to some of the developers' names, but it got easy to grow accustomed and eventually jaded to it.  The time has come, it seems, to say goodbye to the program. Google has sent out an email to some developers discussing the eclipse of the Top Developers badge and system, but there's also a promise of something new on the horizon. The Play Store's app recognition methodology will soon have more of a focus on individual apps and games that are worth noting, instead of an entire dev account. Here's the email: "The Google Play Top Developer program was created to recognize partners who developed top quality Android apps and games Every day developers like you are hard at work creating apps and games on Android. Whether you’re updating an existing app or building something new, we’ve seen an incredible increase in the level of polish and quality in so many fun, entertaining, and useful apps. We want to make sure more people find the great experiences you are creating. The Google Play Top Developer program launched many years ago to recognize developers who created high quality Android apps and games. We conducted research, with both developers and consumers, and observed a clear value and preference for the recognition of individual apps and games, instead of entire organizations. After taking a look at our existing app recognition programs, the Google Play editorial team has decided to focus its efforts on recognizing high quality and innovative apps and games. As a first step, we will be closing the Top Developer program and removing the badging from the Play Store within 30 days. We have exciting plans to recognize more of the great apps and games you create and will be sharing updates soon. We thank you for your continued commitment to Android and Google Play." It's hard to say that this is a bad thing. It will be interesting to see what Google has up its sleeve for the future of app recognition in the Play Store.

Artem Russakovskii The top developer badge stopped being meaningful to me when I saw it given out to developers with lots of bought users, reviews, tons of IAPs, etc. What I'd much rather see is a verified check mark similar to Twitter, Facebook, and G+ so people can be assured they're looking at the right dev account and not a copycat.

I was not informed when I got it nor when I lost it. There were no clear rules who gets it. I also didn't see any marketing advantage (it didn't bring me more downloads). Chainfire XDA Same here. I did not ask to get it, and I did not ask to lose it. I did find it a bit odd to lose my badge with million upon millions of users and several apps with 4.0+ or even 4.5+ average ratings, while review-buyers and the likes retained theirs, but *shrug*.

Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple’s Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. Burger King’s manipulation of Google Home illustrates the vulnerabilities intrinsic to voice assistants that can be targeted by brands, or worse, hackers. But the stunt might help speed up the next developments for home voice assistants: individual voice recognition and even image recognition. FILE – In this March 2, 2016, file photo, David Limp, Amazon Senior Vice President of Devices, pushes down on an Echo Dot in San Francisco. Voice assistants such as Google Home, AppleþÄôs Siri and Amazon Alexa have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. In January 2017, a woman’s 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Alexa for them through an Echo Dot. Since these devices are still new, they’re still having growing pains. But the next generation of voice assistants may come with better security, including individual voice recognition and even image recognition. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) NEW YORK Burger King pulled a pretty juicy marketing stunt last month that drew plenty of attention – not just to the Whopper, but also to the intrinsic vulnerabilities of a new type of voice-activated gadget. The fast food chain’s 15-second television ad targeted Google Home, a speaker that can answer questions and control other smart appliances. When an actor in the ad said “OK, Google” and asked a question about the Whopper, Google Home obediently began reading the burger’s ingredients in homes around the country – effectively extending the commercial for however long it took someone to shout “OK, Google, stop!” Google and Wikipedia quickly made fixes to shut it down. Though annoying, the stunt may have done some good by highlighting how easy it is to hijack such devices. (Just imagine a burglar spying a voice assistant and asking it to unlock all the doors.) It could also speed the development of home voice assistants with better security. “It’s a wakeup call,” said Earl Perkins, a digital security analyst at the research firm Gartner. “It’s a harbinger of things to come.” Voice assistants such as Google Home, Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Echo devices have always been susceptible to accidental hijack. A Google ad during the Super Bowl that used the phrase “OK, Google” reportedly set off people’s devices. And in a January story that briefly turned a family into media celebrities, a woman’s 6-year old daughter ordered a dollhouse and sugar cookies simply by asking Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa for them. Since the devices are so new – the Amazon Echo debuted in 2015, Google Home last year – they’re still having growing pains. And they’re growing in popularity; Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimates that Amazon sold 3 million Echo devices in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2016, bringing the total to more than 8 million. Amazon doesn’t release sales figures. Many experts believe that deliberate attempts to trigger voice assistants will be short-lived. Among other things, brands have to face the consequences of potentially annoying millions of people. “Burger King was doing what the Burger King brand is known to do, stir controversy and make sure it gets lots of coverage,” Forrester principal analyst James McQuivey said. “Very few brands want to do that.” Of course, spammers and other bottom-feeding marketers can still try to implement the technique. But voice assistants already have a few ways to block them. Amazon already makes sure its TV commercials and those of its partners can’t inadvertently trigger the speaker. Developers that provide Echo with “skills” that let it, for instance, order pizza, are also prohibited from creating Alexa commands that would trigger ads. Google says it also has techniques to block TV ads from activating Google Home. Neither company provided details on those techniques. Voice assistants are still in their “very early days,” Google says; the company plans to “monitor and learn as we go.” Hackers might also be a threat. But because voice assistants are so new and limited in scope, more established connected devices such as webcams, routers and printers pose more of a threat for now. “It’s not that we won’t see some creative or unique instance (of hacking), but I don’t think this is going to be the next great wave of cybercrime,” said Steve Grobman, chief technology officer at the security company McAfee. But before long, the devices are going to need better security. “When you move into a world of voice, some of the rules that we’re accustomed to, related to security for computers, change,” Gartner’s Perkins said. Exactly how that works could depend on exactly what task a voice assistant is performing. Asking about the weather requires less security than say, shopping or accessing a bank account. Amazon already has options for setting up security codes to shop, make financial transactions or unlock and start cars. Of course, someone could always overhear you reciting a security phrase. A better solution, and one that companies are hard at work on, would be to identify a person’s voice, much the way Google and Facebook identify faces today. Beyond improving security, that technology could help the device personalize recommendations or even ads for the individual, not the whole family. Apple already lets users voice-train its Siri digital assistant so it’s more likely to activate only when it hears a specific voice. Amazon has a voice training option for Alexa. Google Home can recognize up to six different voices, though it won’t prevent unauthorized users from activating the assistant. You need to be Logged in to sign up for Express Login. Experts suggest that companies will eventually add cameras to voice assistants. Amazon’s new Echo Look has a camera, but it’s for offering fashion advice. Combining a facial scan with voice recognition would definitely beef up security, although they’ll also create new privacy concerns. “Without any security or minimal security, (voice assistants are) going to be a fat target,” Perkins said. “There will be all kinds of innovation associated with compromising these systems.” Share this: Facebook Twitter Google WhatsApp Pinterest Reddit Tumblr More Skype LinkedIn Pocket Email Print Telegram Related Leave a Reply Cancel reply You must be logged in to post a comment.

PHOTO: AFP Attempts at cyber wire fraud globally, via emails purporting to be from trusted business associates, surged in the last seven months of 2016, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a warning to businesses. Fraudsters sought to steal $5.3 billion through schemes known as business email compromise from October 2013 through December, the FBI said in a report released Thursday by its Internet Crime Complaint Center. The figure is up sharply from the FBI’s previous report which said thieves attempted to steal $3.1 billion from October 2013 through May 2016, according to a survey of cases from law enforcement agencies around the world. Google warns users of massive Google Docs phishing scam The number of business-email compromise cases, in which cyber criminals request wire transfers in emails that look like they are from senior corporate executives or business suppliers who regularly request payments, almost doubled from May to December of last year, rising to 40,203 from 22,143, the FBI said. The survey does not track how much money was actually lost to criminals. Robert Holmes, who studies business email compromise for security firm Proofpoint Inc, estimated the incidents collated by the FBI represent just 20 per cent of the total, and that total actual losses could be as much as double the figures reported by the FBI. The losses are growing as scammers become more sophisticated, delving deeper into corporate finance departments to find susceptible targets, he said. “This is not a volume play; it’s a carefully researched play,” he said. Facebook, Google scammed out of $100 million The United States is by far the biggest target market, though fraudsters have started to expand in other developed countries, including Australia, Britain, France and Germany, Holmes said. The FBI has said that about one in four US victims respond by wiring money to fraudsters. In some of those cases, authorities have been able to identify the crimes in time to help victims recover the funds from banks before the criminals pulled them out of the system. The US Department of Justice said in March that it had charged a Lithuanian man with orchestrating a fraudulent email scheme that had tricked agents and employees of two US-based internet companies into wiring more than $100 million to overseas bank accounts. Fraudsters have also used spoofed emails to trick corporate workers into releasing sensitive data, including wage and tax reports, according to the advisory.

Riding through the streets of San Francisco, he occasionally taps or swipes his right hand over the left cuff of his jacket, as the directions he's listening to continually pop up on the screen of this advertisement. It's an ad from iconic US jeans maker Levi Strauss for Project Jacquard, an initiative with Google that the companies started two years ago for so-called “smart” denim. The future of the popular fabric was the focus at a recent international fashion fair in Paris – after all most believe the word denim derives from the French “serge de Nimes”, a serge from the city of Nimes. The fair featured many wearable innovations such as a waterproof jacket with sunscreen bands and a cable in the pocket to recharge a cellphone, or jeans that keep your body temperature stable. Once mainly the purview of athletic gear — with moisture-wicking shirts and trousers and then clothing that can track motion, heart rate, and body temperature — the new trend for fashion designers is to take everyday wear and transform it using new technologies. This is clothing made from specially woven fabric with touchscreen control capabilities that can be designed in such a way to visually stand out or go unnoticed depending on designers' wishes. French-based fashion company Spinali Design, for example, has created jeans that can give wearers directions without having to whip out the mobile at every single intersection. Through bluetooth sensors stitched into the jeans' waistband, the smartphone stays out of sight. “You put a destination into the pap (and) sensors will vibrate right if you need to turn right, left if you need to turn left,” Spinali innovation director Romain Spinali told AFP. In 2015, the company from the eastern French town of Mulhouse designed a bikini that tells women when it's time to apply more sunscreen. The two-piece retails for 149 euros (US$163) and comes with a small detachable ultraviolet sensor that, through a smartphone or tablet, sends a “sunscreen alert” when the sunbather's skin needs more protective cream. The detector is calibrated to the wearer's skin type and how much of a tan she wants to get, and is “virtually devoid of any radiation” Spinali said. The Spinali jeans, made in France, cost 150 euros and also have e-mail notification capabilities. “They will vibrate differently depending on whether the message received is from your family, your friends or work, in a way that you won't have to constantly check your e-mail on weekends or on vacation,” Spinali said. On their end, Google and Levi expect to release their denim jacket sometime this year, but it will come with a hefty US$350 price tag due in part to its special interactive fabric that allows the jacket's wearer to order various products online.   ENIVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS Other international fashion companies have also jumped on the “smart” denim bandwagon. Using thermo-regulated fabric and microfibre cloth popular in athletic wear, Brazilian textile maker Vicugna Textil has designed denims that will keep the wearer's core temperature stable. American designer Cone Denim for its part has blended its denims with technical textile fibres from equipment used on motorcycles — this to better tout the sturdiness of its clothes. But these companies recognise that there has to be more to “smart” jeans than just fashion sense and connected capabilities and that means making sure they are environmentally friendly. “The consumer demands greater traceability and ecology, especially when it comes to denim because it is a product that is a bit controversial,” said Marion Foret, fashion products chief for Premiere Vision Paris, which organises trade shows for the textile and clothing sector, including the denim show. Denim is a product “that doesn't always carry the best reputation, so textile makers are forced to use more ecological processes”, Foret added, such as making denims with organic or traceable cotton, cleaning denims without water, and using dyes that won't pollute the land. In keeping with that trend, Dutch fashion designer Pauline van Wongen makes denims using fabrics from used and already worn jeans. Others seek to keep consumers better informed like Pakistani manufacturer Artistic Fabric Mills which developed an application to retrace the history of the jeans. But for some young fashion students the future of jeans is not all about technology. “Connecting jeans to a smartphone is not necessarily what we want to have,” said Aurelia Martin, who studies fashion in Brussels. “There are problems that are a little more essential in terms of production, the dye, the cotton, the (jeans') pretty weak longevity, and the quality.” ADVERTISEMENT POST A COMMENT HOUSE RULES 1.

First, LG is offering a free Google Home to consumers that buy an LG G6 before May 7, so you can score Google’s smart speaker with the purchase of a G6. T-Mobile has a free gift of its own to LG G6 buyers, offering a free LG G Pad X 8.0. To qualify, you’ll need to buy the LG G6 (or V20) on EIP and then get the G Pad X 8.0 on EIP as well. You’ll also need to sign up for a 2GB or higher mobile internet data plan. Once you do, T-Mobile will mail you a prepaid MasterCard card to cover the cost of the G Pad X 8.0 or whatever else you’d like to spend it on. There’s no word on how long this LG G6 sale will last, so if you’re interested in getting a discounted Android flagship, you may want to act soon.

Gust Forget the monthly payment, just adds to the monthly bill for 2 years, stupid. I would bite at $350-400. Still too high. NardVa I knew the price was gone drop. Debating if I should wait for it to hit $400. Mike You probably can get a used one in the 400’s now. PiCASSiMO Remove the Google speaker (don’t need it), knock off another $100 and I will bite. HeatFan786 Just sell the speaker. I saw some on eBay on sale for like $140 or so. PiCASSiMO Doubt anyone will get $140 for it… selling for about $70-$75 on eBay: http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_sacat=0&_sop=15&LH_Complete=1&LH_ItemCondition=1000&_nkw=google%20home&_dcat=168058&rt=nc&Brand=Google thepanttherlady I agree. Just a quick Google search shows they’re selling brand new for less than $140. http://imgur.com/xZLX4OW HeatFan786 Market is flooded, so I take back the $140 rec. I would just price to sell asap at $70 or so if I am a person looking to get rid of it with the current promo. The first poster is right about asking to get $100 off instead. Saves the hassle and much more rewarding. riverhorse I’ll take the V20 @$480..besides cheaper, most specs are better / also comes with G Pad. G6 has been a huge flagship disappointment…high price n meh specs. Take another $200 off to get rid of it. Acdc1a V20 feels like a much larger phone. Not everyone is into that. I’m still sporting my Nexus 6 most of the time so I’m not in that group. Francisco Peña I passed on the v20 when it was $15 for that reason. Too large, even though I’ve got long fingers, it wasn’t comfortable in my hands, and after switching to usbC with my G5, I didn’t want to go back to micro USB for the S7 Benben Don’t buy any phones right now I was able to see the new payment plans and its going to be much cheaper Ron Kinsey When do you think the new payment plans will be out? Benben That I can not tell you All I know that the first 24 months is going to be 6-8$ and then you can trade for a newer phone or pay it off and keep it Ron Kinsey Sounds pretty good, though sounds to cheap for flagship phones. I did read something about that a day or so ago. Probably wont happen till the 3rd quarter. Sept or so. Peter Truong I think the new plan will be for T-mobile branded phone (HTC maker). Mike JOD u can upgrade three times within a 12 months . With this new plan seems like you’re stuck with the same phone until it’s paid off this is basically a weaker version of Jump with lower payments and no trade in’s for 24 months HeatFan786 So wait, if you’re on JoD already and within your 20 day return window, is it smart to do that? Or just do a JoD upgrade and then opt out of JoD within the return window? Bklynman Don’t need another tablet,already have the Gal.tab.A,from about 1 half ago,plus pick up Note 3 or Note 4 tab.from ebay,I could sell the Google home on ebay,and Lg Pad,get about $150-$200,for both,get pre-card,use that payoff the phone,then keep using my note 3,then sell G6 either on Swappa,or ebay too for anywhere from $250-$400. Then pay off the phone,walk away with $100-200.in my pocket,something to to think about. Adam I’ll wait for the removable battery option. I figure it will come out along with 600MHz support. David I have this phone , its pretty good but currently I’m paying $29 PM on JOD , would have been great deal for $20 JOD + google home don t With the 821 chip, lcd screen and lack of hifi, im afraid I’ll pass. I’ve got the ZTE axon 7. Incredible device. Fully loaded, and it’s better and faster than my pixel was and my S7 EDGE. I’ll wait for the S8. Acdc1a The device feels really great in your hand and the screen is beautiful despite being LCD. I don’t know that I’m a buyer at $410 (value of the Google Home device subtracted) but I think it’s a fine phone for the right buyer. William Kirschman Yes it does fit well in the hand. This phone just seems to be good all around and a steal at $500. The S8 looks great but not for $350 more and not without the dual camera. Mike Thaler My G4 had its bootloop fixed a few months ago (7 day turn around) – but phone started acting weird several weeks ago. Actually was thinking of V20. My take is the S8 is fine – just paying extra $ for the Samsung hype. G6 is a small step below the S8. (Screen, Processor). We were going to buy a Google Home. Tablet is of no value. So I figure G6 is costing us $400. S8 isn’t worth $350 more to us. I was hoping my G4 would last til the V30 comes out in the fall. JJCommonSense The V20 was a steal when TMO had it for $350 Mike Thaler I should have bot it. 64G internal memory and replaceable battery alone would do it now. I thought I could live w. my G4 til V30 in 6 months. Years ago had an HTC (which TM might carry again) but left them when they emulated Apple w. fixed battery. Now the V20 is virtually same price as G6. ($480/$500). NardVa Currently have a G4 that bootlooped back in December 2016. Got it fixed by LG and no problems since. Would love to get the G6 but not at $500. Probably sell the Google Home to get some of the $500 back. Klutz Ive been holding on to my Note 4 because of the removable battery and great screen. I dislike the edge style phones. Got the G6 2 weeks ago and it its pretty awesome. Screen isn’t as vibrant as an Amoled but it was only noticeable when I held them side by side. Most everything else about the G6 is great so far. And I love those dual cameras. Francisco Peña Well… problem solved.. my wife’s phone just bootlooped, and I managed to recover texts and backup the contacts (she didn’t save to google, just on the phone) via the blowdryer method. So new G6, here I come.. whether I wanted it or not.

Company Summary NSE BSE Pfizer Loading data... ADD TO PORTFOLIO ADD TO WATCHLIST SHARE YOUR OULOOK ChartsValuation & Peer ComparisonCommunity Buzz PEER COMPANIES Over $2.6 trillion is held as untaxed cash in offshore accounts by top US companies like Apple, Google, IBM, Pfizer, Pepsi and Coke, McDonald's etc according to a report by the Washington-based Institute for Tax and Economic Policy (ITEP). This is the highest-ever hoard held offshore by American companies and represents a net tax loss of a staggering $767 billion for the US government. The $2.6 trillion untaxed funds are more than the combined GDP of 153 countries, four times the US defence budget, and slightly more than the total mandatory spending of $2.45 trillion on social security, food security, medicare and unemployment by the US government in 2015. The untaxed treasure hoard is more than India's GDP. According to Richard Phillips of ITEP, this information was dug out from 10-K filings, that is, annual reports filed by companies with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Of the 500 top companies in the US, 322 were found to have large offshore holdings. How is it possible for companies to keep their profits abroad and evade taxes? The answer lies in a well-exploited loophole in the US tax code, says Phillips. "The US tax code has a provision, known as deferral, which allows companies to pay no additional US taxes on their offshore earnings until that money is repatriated.When it is technically repatriated, the companies have to pay the full US tax rate, minus any foreign taxes they have already paid," he told TOI. Eyeing this cash, President Donald Trump has proposed an amnesty scheme under which companies can bring back their offshore wealth by paying a one-time 10% tax. The going rate for corporate taxes in US is 35% and, so, a huge concession is being offered. President George W Bush had granted a similar amnesty in 2004 with a onetime tax rate of 5.25% only. However, it was thought to be a failure with companies hoarding more cash abroad hoping for tax holidays. Phillips thinks the best policy to end this hoarding of cash would be to require companies to pay US tax immediately on their offshore earnings, rather than allowing them to defer these taxes as under current law. Without the incentive of tax avoidance, companies would simply stop hoarding their cash offshore, he said.

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Malaysia related news. Finally, I'm out of US internet. Duder12 No good Android News sites in Malaysia? MrLockermanMY There is but it isn't as popular as AP. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing.

I'm getting big profits from home from this work exactly like $20000 every month and sometimes more and if you also actually want to get paid same as that then follow these particular not very difficult directions by looking at this homepage .... ➤➤➤http:[email protected] ... Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill.

May 6, 2017 8:15 PM   Subscribe I picked up this poster at an antique shop. It appears to be a joke about a fake auction sold at a curio shop called Bloch Mercantile in San Francisco around the 1920s. Is there anything else you can tell me about the shop, or about what this poster means? Amazingly, there's very little Google-able information about this thing, but here's what I've found so far: * The poster references Bloch Mercantile Co, which was a curio shop on Market Street in San Francisco in the 20s. There's a picture of the store here. This article about something else from Bloch shed some more light on what the store was and who frequented it. * I can't find the exact wording of this poster anywhere, but there are a few similar examples in newspaper archives and elsewhere online, most notably this one. These are what lead me to think this is a joke (in addition to the obviously joke-y names), but I can't tell where it originated or even what's supposed to be funny about the whole thing. I still have a lot of questions I'm hoping someone can answer. What is the joke here? Where did this come from? What was Bloch Mercantile Company, and what else did it sell? Any light you can shed on this thing's context would be super cool. posted by Apropos of Something to Society & Culture (11 answers total) 3 users marked this as a favorite   This is exciting. So, it's a fake/satirical auction sale notice. Auction notices were extremely common in print products up through, really, the 60s and maybe longer in rural areas. They were commonly submitted to and printed in newspapers, as you found - and I also found random phrases in other newspapers like this, so for certain it was a squib circulated in journalism circles and reprinted all over because, presumably, people could understand the humor and find it funny. Here's another version, from 1916, that seems to be presented as college humor. Since it is printed by E. Bloch Mercantile, which seems to be an importer/exporter, maybe it was meant as a humorous ad for their services? The earliest one I found was from 1913, so it dates back a ways, but I also found one from 1940, meaning it's a chestnut. It seems to make fun of farms going bust, resulting in an auction, and the periodic cyclical farm and financial crises that were dirt-common until we had a social safety net. The language seems like the idea is to sucker in city people looking to make a score but not knowing a lot about rural life, who'd accept these descriptions without realizing they're silly. For instance, something like "seven dapple grey chickens" would make a livestock raiser laugh, since you'd never describe chickens as "dapple grey" - that's a horse description. I also think I see traces of sort of a society dealing with technological change - like, the specs are mixed-up, some appropriate to basic farm equipment, some to newer gasoline-powered machinery, and some to fashion and food. So it sort of speaks to a moment in which consumer choices and advertising are proliferating and the language pertinent to each sale area is starting to jumble in the imagination. Maybe it also pokes fun at people ignorant about rural things. The names "I. Holdem" and "U. Socem" are puns about taking advantage of consumers, on the order of the Tappet Brothers' "Dewey, Cheatham and Howe" law firm. Beyond that, I can't contextualize that much. You've found something interesting and it appears to have had a widespread existence as a popular and common humor meme. If I were to pursue it would contact historians of journalism and advertising. posted by Miko at 8:53 PM on May 6 [6 favorites] Those are nonsense items and names. This auction wouldn't have ever happened. If you have some familiarity with farming or older tools, you'll catch some of the jokes. (Some are pretty funny!) -Bulls are boys, cows are girls. 7 milk cows 2 of which are bulls is nonsense. -poland China is a pig breed, not a cow breed -fell pony (not cow!) Is a breed of pony, "that never fell" is a play on words etc. The names I. Ketchum (I catch them) We Holdem (we hold them) and U Sockem (you sock them) are probably a joke about catching con artists. posted by windykites at 8:58 PM on May 6 Yeah, when I think about it, what's going on between 1900 and 1940 is that the US is shifting from a majority-rural to a majority-urban population. IN 1870, 1 out of 4 Americans lived in a rural household. By 1900, 2 out of 4 did - a 100% increase. In the decade 1940-1950, that went up to 2/3. So I think one of the underlying sources of humor is that people were becoming less and less literate with the language and rituals of country life. It's an auction notice full of B.S. and puns and nonsense and counterfactual things, but thrown out there in the confident tone of someone with mastery of content. I think they're sort of playing on the city slicker vs. rootsy country guy dichotomy, here. It captures a moment where knowledge of rural things is starting to matter less, and there are more and more citified people that would, in the joke, be unable to recognize how silly and BS this all is. I'm still kind of stuck on the "plan to commit suicide" angle. These notices commonly appeared after a farm owner's death. There's something interesting about the notion of planning ahead for it. And maybe it fits into the pretty classic folklore trope of having a country person get one over on a supposedly smarter city slicker - like, I'm going to sell all this before I'm dead instead of after, and convince you it's worth a lot using my fancy language, and cash in and laugh all the way to the bank. posted by Miko at 9:09 PM on May 6 [2 favorites] Here's as many more as I can figure: Calves dont have pups, and the weather wouldn't influence what day they did, Leghorns are a chicken breed, not a pig breed, and pigs don't have long golden hair growing down their backs, A wood saw doesn't need instructions, I don't know if triple extension bicycles existed but I'm sure they didn't have patent (leather) jeweled levers, (Not sure about the plow) I doubt a dung fork could have a useful fly net, but I'm sure they wished to could, I don't think you can trot, pace, or gallop a wheelbarrow, Horses are dapple grey, not chickens, Olive chilled plow with velveteen flounces- why would you chill a plow or put flounces- on it? Flounces go on dresses. (Dunno about a jassac) Double breasted is a type of jacket, not cupboard. All baking ovens would have likely been "stationary" except Dutch ovens Bob sleds aren't mechanical, they don't need automatic cutoffs of anything Cross eyed fountain pen for a left handed person... Come on... Canine constructed on the Hibernian plan (in the Hibernian style) I guess means an Irish setter? No such thing as a "Willie" goat and goats dont have red whiskers "a-la-mode" (in the modern style, or, with ice cream?) and certainly can't be made to work in teams, And if you were going to commit suicide you sure wouldn't put it on an auction flyer. Not sure what the sale time means. posted by windykites at 9:14 PM on May 6 Anyways, I think it's just a silly thing someone did for laughs. I don't think there's a big deep meaning to it. People have always liked to troll. It's funny because it's absurd. posted by windykites at 9:20 PM on May 6 [1 favorite] Not sure what the sale time means. There's a humor in just saying "next week" or "Eleven AM PDQ" because, like, when? It's an auction, so you have to be there at the precise day and time in order to buy anything at all. So I think that's part of the joke. But I don't quite get "froze to death" and the rest. It really is in soooo many newspapers - this thing was widely printed. I found a bunch more searching on "bulltoad road." Each phrase I search yields a different newspaper version. posted by Miko at 9:26 PM on May 6 Okay, cool. I'm glad I'm not the only one who finds this interesting. But I don't quite get "froze to death" and the rest. Is there something in "froze to death" being part of Oh, Susanna, given that that's also kind of nonsense-y? posted by Apropos of Something at 9:31 PM on May 6 Poland China is also a pig, not a cow. posted by Miko at 9:33 PM on May 6 But I don't quite get "froze to death" and the rest. A sideways reference to the Year Without a Summer. posted by Knappster at 9:34 PM on May 6 I doubt it; that was two generations earlier. posted by Miko at 9:37 PM on May 6 Some Google-investigating of the full phrase "1900 and froze to death" suggests that it's a not-very-common bit of vernacular, a way of humorously saying "a long time ago but I'm being intentionally vague about the exact date." Possibly originating as a reference to the winter of 1918, which was supposedly especially harsh. posted by soundguy99 at 10:00 PM on May 6 « Older Chicagoland Dog Behaviorist Recs   |   bounded compassion among buddhists Newer » You are not logged in, either login or create an account to post comments Related Questions Stores in San Francisco November 17, 2015 Fun 1-hr activities around the bay area?

The Hollywood Reporter Movies TV Business Style Politics Tech Culture Awards Video Sites Heat Vision Live Feed Esq The Race Behind the Screen Bastard Machine Rambling Reporter The Fien Print Subscribe Site Tools Newsletters Daily Edition Behind The Screen Digital Power YouTube CEO Apologizes to Advertisers: "We Can and We Will Do Better" 5:00 AM PDT 5/5/2017 by Natalie Jarvey FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Courtesy of Getty Images YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki In her NewFronts pitch, Susan Wojcicki directly addressed the backlash by top brands over some ads appearing next to racist or offensive content. In the years since YouTube held its first Brandcast pitch to advertisers in New York, the Google-owned streamer’s message has gotten increasingly easier to sell: What brands wouldn’t want to pay for access to YouTube’s influential set of homegrown stars and its more than 1 billion users?  But at the Javits Center on Thursday night, it was time for the streaming giant to issue a mea culpa. PepsiCo, Wal-Mart, Dish and several other big brands had all previously announced plans to suspend their advertising from YouTube following reports that their ads and others were appearing alongside violent, inappropriate or racist content.  "The last couple weeks have been challenging for some of you," CEO Susan Wojcicki acknowledged to the room full of advertisers early during YouTube's hourlong presentation. "I want you to know that we have taken your feedback to heart. We work hard every day to earn our advertisers' and agencies' trust. We apologize for letting some of you down. We can, and we will, do better." YouTube had already apologized for the issue and said that it was going to change its policies to monitor content. It also previously announced plans to give advertisers more control over where their ads go. But the controversy still loomed large over the annual event, part of the two-week pitchfest called as NewFronts, where YouTube is known for throwing one of the most lavish parties. (Past performers have included Sia and Bruno Mars.) Throughout the NewFronts several digital companies took aim at YouTube by discussing their platform's "brand safety," including Conde Nast Entertainment, which promised that advertisers would know exactly what they were getting when they advertised on its portfolio of brands like Vogue or GQ.  But YouTube has the scale that many of the NewFronts presenters will never reach, and after her apology Wojcicki made sure to remind the Brandcast audience of that. She rattled off several stats about the streamer, including that there are 75 percent more channels with over one million subscribers than there were last year, and that watch time of TV channels on YouTube has grown by 50 percent. Wojcicki also highlighted Google Preferred, a program that allows advertisers to buy against the top 5 percent of channels on YouTube, which gives brands more control over where their ads go and has recently been expanded into more than 20 countries.  The presentation then proceeded to make the case that YouTube is a better buy than television. "YouTube is not TV and we never will be," she proclaimed, noting the diversity, authenticity and community of endemic YouTube creators. "Our users don't come to YouTube for polish. They come for texture."  Filmmaker and vlogger Casey Neistat, who it's worth noting recently sold his company to CNN and is building a new digital business with the cable news network, came onstage to share his experience with YouTube. Halfway through the talk he literally dropped his microphone on the ground, saying "my hand is old media ... and the floor is YouTube."  But YouTube does still seem to be chasing television when it comes to original programming. The streamer announced a slate of seven new, ad-supported originals from a mix of traditional stars with big YouTube channels like Ellen DeGeneres and Kevin Hart and digital talent like Rhett & Link — all which will help YouTube target the advertising dollars that have traditionally flown into television. The projects are already winning over brands. The company announced that Johnson & Johnson — which previously told The Times that it was suspending its YouTube advertising — would sponsor Ryan Seacrest-produced competition series Best.Cover.Ever. YouTube not only used Brandcast to smooth things over with advertisers, but also with creators. The company's annual Creator Summit, held the same week as Brandcast, turned into an opportunity for it to address YouTuber's questions about declining revenue following tweaks YouTube made to its ad products in response to advertiser concerns. Sources tell THR that the issue was top of mind when creators spoke to Wojcicki on Wednesday ahead of Brandcast, but that the conversation was ultimately open and productive. And YouTube — whose parent company Alphabet just reported revenue increases of 22 percent to $24.75 billion during the first quarter of the year — didn't seem to have any problem packing hundreds of buyers and media executives into its Javits Center event Thursday night, which featured appearances by James Corden and Kevin Hart and a surprise performance by Katy Perry.    FACEBOOK TWITTER EMAIL ME PRINT COMMENTS Natalie Jarvey Natalie.Jarvey@thr.com NatJarv Comments comments powered by Disqus The Hollywood Reporter © 2017 The Hollywood Reporter All rights reserved.

But why bother trying to hunt down another console when the smartphone in your pocket can already do almost everything the Switch can — with a few upgrades. Image: Gizmodo Nintendo Switch Review: Plays Zelda Great, Doesn't Do Much Else After a shipping snafu with Amazon, I spent the better part of a day trying to track a Nintendo Switch down. I experienced exactly what many hopeful Switch owners will experience. And now I've spent the last few days living the Switch life, playing the best it has to offer and I can say, unequivocally, that this system is not worth the hassle of tracking it down. Read more You probably occasionally use your smartphone as a portable gaming machine, although limited to just quick rounds of Candy Crush as you ride the subway every day. But a modern smartphone, with a beefy processor and a decent-sized display, can do almost everything the Nintendo Switch can (sadly Breath of the Wild will still be out of your reach). What We Know About The Nintendo Switch's Garbage Graphics The Nintendo Switch looks like it might be complete weaksauce when compared to the best consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But the real question is. Does that matter? Probably not. Read more In fact, your smartphone might actually offer a few upgrades over the Switch! There are far more games available, including emulators that let you play classic titles from almost any console. Though you'll need to put in a little effort if you want to play old Zelda games on your iPhone. Besides games, your phone almost certainly offers a better visual experience than the Switch does. Nintendo chose to use an LCD display limited to a resolution of just 1280x720 pixels and many smartphones are capable of at least full 1920x1080 HD resolutions with colour saturation and fidelity that far outperform the Switch's screen. But having access to thousands of great titles on a beautiful screen means nothing when trying to play action games using a touchscreen. Ask anyone who's tried, it is an act of absolute frustration. Controllers So the first upgrade you'll need to turn your smartphone into a Switch are some better controls. After all, touchscreens suck when it comes to playing games that require more than just tapping the screen. With the right accessories you can almost perfectly emulate the Switch's handheld gaming experience, or connect multiple wireless controllers for some mobile multiplayer. Switch Style Controllers Gamevice Controller (iOS) The closest you'll get to recreating the Nintendo Switch's form factor is the $150 Gamevice that wraps your smartphone in a pair of halved controllers featuring analogue joysticks, a directional pad and a set of four action buttons. You'll at least need an iPhone 6 to use it, but it connects to the device's Lightning port without the need for battery-sucking Bluetooth. MOGA Ace Power Controller (iOS) It's essentially the same product as the Gamevice, but the MOGA Ace Power packs a rechargeable battery to help keep your smartphone running longer, but it's only compatible with older iPhones. Anything larger than the iPhone 5s will be too big for the MOGA Ace Power to wrap around. Australian stock is hard to come by, but you can always hit up eBay, where prices start at $34 (including postage). 8Bitdo Zero Controller (iOS & Android) The Switch's two controllers handily slide off either end of the console to be used for multiplayer experiences, and if you want a similarly super tiny controller for your iOS or Android device than maybe you should consider the $30 8Bitdo Zero. It works with any device that can wirelessly connect to Bluetooth peripherals and offers basic controls including shoulder buttons, a directional pad, and four action buttons. Switch Pro Style Controllers SteelSeries Stratus XL Controller (Android) We're a big fan of SteelSeries, so while the $89 SteelSeries Stratus XL isn't ideal for travelling, we still think it's a good choice for when your smartphone's connected to a TV for big-screen gaming. It's not as cool as a Switch controller but its a comparable alternative to the Nintendo Switch's Pro Controller. And while it doesn't have any force feedback features, it does promise 40 hours of gameplay on a single pair of AA batteries. SteelSeries Nimbus Controller (iOS) The $100 SteelSeries Nimbus wireless controller is the iOS equivalent of the company's Stratus XL, giving you essentially the same experience as the full-size Nintendo Switch Pro Controller. With a few bonuses: It can be charged using the same Lightning cable you plug your iPhone into every night and it features a dedicated menu button for navigating iOS or your Apple TV. 8Bitdo Wireless NES & SNES Controllers (iOS & Android) The Nintendo Switch will inevitably get access to the company's Virtual Console, letting you play your favourite classic games. But with a smartphone running an emulator you can play them all now. And with 8Bitdo's $53 NES and SNES Bluetooth controllers, near-perfect recreations of the originals, you might feel like you're back in your parent's basement, slamming cans of Passiona while playing Super Mario World. Video Adapters One of the Nintendo Switch's most unique features is its ability to transform from a handheld gaming system to a part of your entertainment center so you can play your games on a big screen TV. The Switch relies on a cumbersome dock to do this, but there are more elegant ways to connect your smartphone to a TV, including going wireless. There are pros and cons to each approach, however, so you'll need to decide what works best for you. Going wireless means you don't have to deal with your smartphone being tethered to a long HDMI cable. But it might mean some costly hardware upgrades if you don't already have a reliable wireless network in your home, or a TV setup that facilitates streaming from a mobile device. Using a video adaptor physically connected to your TV means you'll have to wrangle HDMI and charging cables while you play. Yet it also guarantees smooth frame rates at all times, and the ability to enjoy your games on a friend's TV, or a TV in a hotel room, where you can't easily connect to a reliable (or secure) wireless network. The Wireless Options Apple TV (iOS) If you want to wirelessly connect your iPhone to your TV using AirPlay, the Apple TV is your easiest solution. However, at $239 it's half the price of a Nintendo Switch and you'll need to ensure your wireless router is up to the task of streaming video to your TV without dropping frames, which can ruin the gaming experience. Google Chromecast (Android) Chromcast can with iPhones games streamed to the TV too, but the experience isn't always pleasant. Yet, for mirroring the gaming action on your Android smartphone to a TV, using a Google Chromecast is the way to go. Its small and unobtrusive and is only $59. That's a downright bargain — as long as you can live with resolutions that top out at 1920x1080 HD. Google Chromecast Ultra (Android) Can the Nintendo Switch do 4K? Nope. But your Android smartphone probably can when connected to your TV via the Google Chromecast Ultra. It goes $99 — just ten dollars more than a Switch game and it has an ethernet port for connecting directly to your router. That should help take some of the load off of your wireless network to ensure solid frame rates when streaming your favourite games. The Wired Options Apple Lightning Digital AV Adaptor (iOS) Reliable wired options for iOS devices are few and far between. If you're using an iPhone your best bet is to shell out a few more bucks to Apple and buy the $75 official Lightning to HDMI adaptor. Fortunately it also includes an additional USB-C port so you can power your device while it's connected to a TV using its Lightning port. MicroUSB to HDMI Adaptor (Android) If you're using an older Android device that doesn't have a USB-C connection, you'll need this microUSB to HDMI adaptor. You probably won't be able to push 4K resolution games to your TV, but at $8 it's a cheap and compact solution. Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adaptor (Android) The iPhone doesn't support USB-C just yet, but most of the Android smartphones released in the past year do. As do many laptops. So Apple's USB-C to HDMI adaptor might be worth the $109 investment. When you're not using it to connect an Android smartphone to your TV for gaming, it also has a USB-A port for connecting older peripherals to your fancy new laptop. Games This is where your makeshift smartphone Switch can run laps around Nintendo's console — at least in terms of selection. At the moment, the best reasons to buy a Nintendo Switch are Zelda: Breath of the Wild, and Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. That's just two games. They both happen to be very good games, but the iTunes App Store and the Google Play store both have thousands of titles you can download, and plenty that are actually good. But which platform offers the better gaming experience? Apple's walled garden approach to its app store means you're less likely to get fooled buying a knock-off game. Its MFi certification program also ensures that if a controller says 'Made for iPhone' on the packaging, it's guaranteed to connect and work with your phone right out of the box. Not all iOS games will work with a MFi-approved controller, however, and using a generic Bluetooth gamepad with your iPhone is hit and miss. Android smartphones, on the other hand, have access to the Google Play store, which is like the wild west when it comes to content. Anything and everything goes, and you can probably find exactly what you need if you know where to look. That includes games, apps for remapping the buttons on a Bluetooth controller so it works flawlessly with any title, and emulators. Part of the appeal of recent Nintendo consoles has been the company's Virtual Console which allows you to play classic NES, SNES, and Game Boy games on modern hardware. But with the right emulator, Android smartphones can play classic games from countless different consoles, including the Atari 2600, Playstation, Game Boy Advance, PSP, PS2 and even the Game Cube. As for finding those games (commonly referred to as ROMs) that's between you and a strategic Google search. How To Build Your Own Mini SNES The NES Classic Edition is almost perfect — short controller cords not withstanding — and if you can buy one, it's one of our favourite gifts, especially if you don't want to leave the house. But it only plays NES games, and 30 games at that. Plenty of people — us included — would love a tiny system to play our favourite Super Nintendo games. Or Genesis games. Read more Can you play games like Zelda: Breath of the Wild or Mario Kart 8 Deluxe on your smartphone yet? No. So the Nintendo Switch will always be able to hold that over your smartphone FrankenSwitch. But you just saved yourself $US300+ ($404)+, and having to wait in yet another line hoping that Best Buy has restocked enough of them. WATCH MORE: Gaming News Comments Join the discussion!

Adobe software has always been expensive, but at least it was one upfront cost. As it turns out, we were right. Another annual price increase for Creative Cloud is happening a month from now, and it represents the latest jump in a nearly 250 per cent price rise for some Creative Cloud plans since it started.

Wonder Woman is finally getting a movie, and the trailers we have seen look fantastic. So, like any upcoming superhero movie, here we are expecting to be swamped with teasers, behind the scenes footage, interviews, merchandise, advertising, magazine covers, talk show appearances - except that's not what is happening at all.

Not at the plate, where his batting average is .246, certainly not indicative of the lasers he has been spraying around the field early on this season. No, Castellanos is going through an early season slump at third base, where defensively, he hasn’t been making the kind of plays he’s been expected to after such an improvement last season and this spring. “Just a little bit of a slump,” Ausmus said. “Defensive slumps happen. They don’t happen as often as offensive slumps, but they do happen.” Castellanos committed his sixth error of the season in Friday night’s win over the Athletics. In 2016, he committed nine total errors, though that campaign was shortened by a six-week injury.

Have the same confidence despite the recent struggles.” The view from the press box is this: Castellanos’ defensive strides last season, and certainly this spring, were real. They will show up soon enough. For some time, he has made most of the necessary plays at third base. The same could not be said this season, too often botching routine plays. He’s shown improved range and should snap out of the defensive slump sooner rather than later. Contact Anthony Fenech: afenech@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @anthonyfenech.

Search | Advanced search Home | Entertainment | WHY POP-UP SHOPS ARE THE FUTURE WHY POP-UP SHOPS ARE THE FUTURE 07/05/2017 01:39:00 BY PHUMLA DLAMINI Font size: I was amazed by a report last week announcing that pop-up stores are now worth E2.3 billion to the UK economy. From Google to Ugg boots pop-up shops have become a great way for businesses to market themselves, but it’s incredible to think that such small shops can contribute so much. More than that, though, it’s refreshing to see that physical retail still has a very important place in the modern economy. Amidst all the news of the rise of ecommerce and billion-Dollar tech companies, it’s proof that physical retail can innovate and that customer experience is still important. In fact, it’s often the experience element that leads digital businesses to launch temporary stores, as they look for an innovative way to attract new customers. CJ Accessories, which is an online business entity run locally, is one such business that has done very well from its pop-up initiatives. Their Covent Garden-based pop-up is always a roaring success having recently put-up a pop up at Funtown in Fonteyn. I am personally a big fan not least because, with its live craft demonstrations, it really emphasised the unique nature of the artisanal online marketplace. Pop-up shops are a booming new trend that has broadened thinking in the traditional retail sector. Temporarily opened to take advantage of a seasonal product or to test the potential of a product or concept in the market, pop-up shops have gained an increasing popularity in Swaziland. Pop-up shops are an ideal way for entrepreneurs to sell and promote their business, and by doing so, it allows them to gauge whether or not it will have long-term benefits in the market. It is cost effective, with low overheads and does not require the commitment of a full lease agreement. With the dismal Swazi economy, entrepreneurs and retail centres are forced to find ways of making additional revenue. Pop-up shops offer many benefits to both the entrepreneur and the shopping centre. New business owners that are looking to expand should take advantage of an opportunity like this to create awareness around their brand. Opening a pop-up shops comes with its own set of challenges for entrepreneurs. It is difficult for business owners to find staff and shop assistants that are willing to enter in a contract of employment that is on a short-term basis and does not offer long-term financial security. In addition to this, training staff for such a short period of employment is costly for business owners, he says. Shopping centres are seeing some great benefits with the opening of temporary stores. Instead of having shops that are vacant, landlords are placing pop-up shop tenants, also known as nursery tenants. This allows the centre to ascertain if the products or services being offered are suitable for their target market and if it is worth offering the nursery tenant a permanent lease agreement. : del.icio.us | Digg Comments (0 posted): Post your comment Your name: Your e-mail address: Add your comments:  Please enter the code you see in the image: Image: Code: Most Popular Most E-mailed ‘I AND THOU’ COPS USED ME TO CATCH KIDNAP SUSPECTS - PLUMBER DISQUALIFIED COMPANY GIVEN E330M TENDER NO BUSINESS WILL BE REMOVED NEAR HILTON GARDEN HOTEL – PSPF SIBUSISO MANANA DIES! ‘I AND THOU’ COPS USED ME TO CATCH KIDNAP SUSPECTS - PLUMBER DISQUALIFIED COMPANY GIVEN E330M TENDER NO BUSINESS WILL BE REMOVED NEAR HILTON GARDEN HOTEL – PSPF SIBUSISO MANANA DIES!

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 143k 114k Latest Deals 19 [Deal Alert] Runtastic Road Bike Pro is free on the Play Store (down from $4.99) 2017/05/06 1:33am PDTMay 6, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 18 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Making a mockery of 'justice' | Bangkok Post: opinion News Business Video Photos Opinion Lifestyle Auto Jobs Property Travel Learning Tech More OPINION Log in Sign up Web search MENU Search Switch Archive Today's paper DIGITAL VERSION SIGN IN About E-Newspaper Subscribe Report problem Free Trial HOME DELIVERY opinion homepage Opinion View latest View by columnist Postbag Online poll Most commented Expat forum Opinion > Postbag Making a mockery of 'justice' Postbag Views from readers of the Bangkok Post Mail Facebook Twitter 7 May 2017 at 04:00 NEWSPAPER SECTION: NEWS 990 viewed2 comments - + As things stand now, wealthy fugitives from Thai law, such as Thaksin Shinawatra or Vorayuth "Boss" Yoovidhya, who is wanted over a hit-and-run killing of a policeman, can evade accountability for their alleged crimes simply by fleeing overseas until the statutes of limitations applicable in their cases expire, after which the suspect is free to return, untouchable by the law. That hardly deters crime and makes a mockery of the Thai system of justice. I propose that where warrants have been issued, if the person goes overseas, the clock on the statute of limitation in their cases be stopped automatically until such time as the suspect is placed under custody. I accept that the Thai system of justice is itself badly in need of reform, but fleeing the country doesn't foster such change. The accused must face the music, all the while fighting for a trial that is impartial, transparent and fast. Burin Kantabutra A good sporting chance All sport is free to watch on the internet and it's all legal. You will need a computer with a Windows operating system and Google Chrome, which works best with an ad-blocker installed. Go to the Google web store and install for free Ad Guard Ad-blocker, which works well. Search for stream2watch.cc and you're ready. Once you're there, click on live sports and you will be redirected but click on the x on the address bar (very quickly) and you will get back to the page. When you click on a game, wait for a white window and, after the seconds count down to zero, double click the x and you're ready. If you do not get a white window, click on a different stream and try again. Every time you get redirected, click on the x in the address bar -- do it quickly -- and you will get back to where you want. You can watch all sports from everywhere with a great picture. I have been using it for four months and I get a great deal of sports. Another one is sportp2p.com with a good amount of sports, though not as good as the other site. If you want American TV on the internet, all channels just like cable in the States, go to streamlive.to and click on premium and see what you get. It's close to HD quality. You can't beat this deal. I cancelled True when I found out about this one. Bill Hisler Avoid it like the plaque As is so often the case, the cover-up -- like the missing plaque -- attracts more attention than the original act. The "government", through the police, are now ordering groups not to discuss it (BP, May 4). Somehow it all manages to be both hilarious and deeply sinister. It's hard to resist the feeling that solving this little mystery would provide the clearest insights into where the country is heading and who is heading it. Yanawa David High speed doesn't mean all stops Bravo to the Transport Ministry, ("Rail study slammed for its 'lack of details'") for slamming the SRT study for a high-speed rail link between Bangkok and Korat. One hardly expects any high-speed rail service to stop at every little whistle stop as that would put it on par with the present SRT local runs. A train picks up paying passengers to rely on profit. A high-speed Bangkok to Korat train might make one or two stops between its leaving and arriving terminals. A high-speed train that does not fill its passenger quota per run would be equivalent to the now-defunct Concorde flying half empty. The SRT should first concentrate on improving service and rolling stock, and that should attract more passengers. The free rides on commuter lines are no answer to anything, having led to an attitude by the SRT of "who cares as long as it moves". The Transport Ministry is demanding, and rightfully so, to see studies involving the "what if" factor, in the event these high-speed trains are, in the end, not financially viable. I guess there is always room in Sattahip for them next to the aircraft carrier and the soon-to-be purchased submarines, along with the army's defunct blimp, plastic fake mine detectors and the other forgotten cast-offs, rotting away. It is sort of like the cavernous (outdoor) storage facility in the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark. Jack Gilead Let's see who's really lying Re: "Court rejects 6 sex ring warrant bids", (BP, May 4). The news that Thai police investigators are planning to put one of the victims in the Mae Hong Son child sex-for-sale scandal to undergo a lie detector test is profoundly unbelievable. Instead of doing so, why don't we put the ex-governor of the province and other police and provincial officials -- who are alleged to have been the masterminds and customers in this child prostitution case -- to the lie detector to see whether they are lying? Vint Chavala Disgraceful discrepancy A new water park at Phantai Norasingh opens this week. I am shocked to see the ticket price difference stated in Thai and in English. For Thais: Adults @ 399 baht, Kids @ 299. In English: Adults @ 999, Kids @ 899. You want to charge foreigners higher but with such a difference? How can Thai tourism survive in the future? Or is it because you are trying not to have foreigners visit? Millie Tan System is deeply flawed Bravo to the Justice Office, which, according to local media reports, is contributing 2 million baht for bail for the two elderly people sentenced to prison for 15 years (reduced to five) for picking mushrooms. Doesn't something seem obviously flawed in a system that sentences mushroom pickers, who were made scapegoats for illegal logging, the shoddy investigative work in the Koh Tao murders, and then, on the other hand, letting the killer driver elude justice (seemingly willingly on the part of the police) for the past five years? Something grossly stinks, and I can tell you it's more than rotten mushrooms.

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 143k 114k Latest Deals 19 [Deal Alert] Runtastic Road Bike Pro is free on the Play Store (down from $4.99) 2017/05/06 1:33am PDTMay 6, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 18 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

He began the meeting by responding to questions about Wells Fargo's fake accounts scandal with strong criticism for how the bank handled the situation, saying it was a "huge, huge, huge error" if the company ignored calls from employees reporting misconduct. "They totally underestimated the impact of what they had done once it became uncovered," he said. "The main problem was that they didn't act when they learned about it." Buffett placed blame on Wells Fargo's incentive system, which paid, graded and promoted workers based on the number of services they sold to customers. "It turned out that it incentivized the wrong kind of behavior," he said. He added the company had become too accustom to paying fines much larger than the $185 million it paid the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and didn't properly assess the severity of the misconduct. "They measured the seriousness of the problem by the dimensions of the fine and they thought it signaled a less offensive practice," he said. The annual powwow was attended by thousands of Buffett investors and disciples. The annual Berkshire Hathaway meeting has been dubbed "Woodstock for capitalists." Buffett, 86, was ranked this year by Fortune magazine as the world's second-richest man, worth an estimated $75.6 billion. Even the Oracle of Omaha admitted he's made mistakes. He was critical of himself while speaking to shareholders as he and vice chairman Charles Munger admitted they made a mistake not investing in Google early, despite his subsidiary Geico being an early user of its ad service. "We were close on seeing the impact," Munger said. Buffett marveled at modern tech companies and their ability to accumulate market value with minimal fixed assets or capital needs. "The five largest market cap companies in America are worth $2.5 trillion and require no equity capital. That is an extraordinary change from the past," he said. He said this change in market led him to value his investment in IBM less and seek out more stock in Apple. "We do view them very differently," he said. "I think Apple is much more of a consumer products business."

Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Latest Business Technology Artificial Intelligence VR/AR Autonomous Vehicles Graphene Financial Glossary Smartphone-based UK retail searches up 23 percent Smartphone-based UK retail searches up 23 percent May 6, 2017, 9:11 PM BST | Written by Catharine Paddock | Analysis of the volumes of UK retail searches made in the first quarter of 2017 shows that the growth of smartphone use for online retail browsing has outstripped that of all other devices. Figures from the latest issue of the British Retail Consortium (BRC) Google Online Retail Monitor reveal that the volume of UK retail searches made on smartphones grew by 23 percent in the first three months of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The latest figures for UK retail searches highlight the need for retailers to make their online shops as easy to use on a smartphone as on other devices. Image: pixabay-791644 This growth in smartphone use for online retail browsing is over three times faster than usage across all devices, which was 7 percent up in Q1 of 2017 compared to the previous year. Smartphone shopping needs to be as easy as on other devices The figures for UK retail searches highlight the important need for online retailers to serve shoppers browsing for goods on their smartphones as well as they serve shoppers browsing on other devices such as their laptops and computers. BRC Chief Executive Helen Dickinson says, this means, for example, that: “Smartphone-ready sites and quick loading times are essential to holding customers’ attention and converting searches into sales.” Martijn Bertisen, Retail Director at Google says the figures indicate that – for the first 3 months of the year at least – “digital continued to drive growth for our UK retailers.” Regional contrasts On a regional basis, the analysis reveals some stark contrasts. While there was a slowdown in UK retail searches made from the London area, down 8 percent on Q1 of 2016, searches made in the South West were up 23 percent on Q1 of 2016. UK retail searches from overseas also remains strong, “with countries as far flung as Estonia and large markets like Germany seeing particularly strong growth,” says Dickinson, who also adds: “Online sales now consistently make up over a fifth of total retail sales at home, while the appetite for UK brands abroad is clear to see. Satisfying this interest from home and abroad, via computer or smartphone, is the key for UK retailers to make the best of their online offering.” Average spend via smartphone shopping also up Meanwhile figures announced a month earlier by IMRG, the UK’s online retail association, reveal that not only are shoppers making more use of mobile devices, but that the average amount spent is also rising. IMRG managing director Justin Opie says: “Over the past few years we have recorded very strong online retail sales growth through smartphone devices and it seems shoppers are getting more confident about checking out with higher baskets through these devices.” He suggests that a likely reason for this is that online retailers are paying more attention to making the smartphone versions of their sites as easy to use as possible. Another reason could be the next-day delivery enticement, he notes, “it has become fairly common for online retailers to offer next-day for free if the total spend is above a set threshold.” Share this article: Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Print No part of this website or any of its contents may be reproduced, copied, or modified, without prior consent, unless otherwise indicated for stand-alone materials.

Cameron, Defender Guest Writer Leave a comment 8 reads Mindfulness is a type of meditation that’s said to enhance emotional well-being. It’s become extremely popular in recent years, with major companies such as Google, Goldman Sachs and General Motors encouraging its practice amongst their employees. NASA, the US Olympic team and the Navy SEALs are just three organizations said to use this type of meditation as part of their training. Mindfulness has also been promoted by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Kobe Bryant and Emma Watson. So what exactly is mindfulness and how is it practiced?  What exactly is mindfulness? Worry and anxiety often enter our minds via thinking about what has happened in the past or what may happen in the future. Mindfulness is a way of controlling this type of instinctive, yet negative thinking. By being fully focused on the present moment, it means you are not thinking about the past or future and the worries or anxieties that may accompany this. As such, practiced regularly, mindfulness is said to have long-term benefits on how to cope with the stresses of everyday life. What are the origins of mindfulness? The name mindfulness is a translation of the Sanskrit word for remembrance or awareness. It’s known mostly as a form of Buddhist meditation but is also thought to date back to ancient Hindu traditions 2,500 years ago. It has gained popularity and recognition in recent times, most notably through Jon Kabat-Zinn who introduced the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program at the University of Massachusetts in the late 1970’s. Mindfulness has continued to grow in popularity, becoming an accepted part of modern-day psychology. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is the most recent innovation of this stress-reducing technique, building on work achieved with MBSR. Who can benefit from practicing mindfulness? Mindfulness can be beneficial to anyone wishing to reduce stress and worry. It’s particularly helpful for people suffering from psychological conditions such as severe anxiety, depression and addiction. It’s also thought to help with physical ailments such as heart disease, gastrointestinal problems and chronic pain. This is, in part, because those suffering from medical conditions like depression and physical pain are more prone to negative thoughts. Mindfulness in more detail. Without realizing it, at any given moment, the brain is a hub of hyperactive mental activity. Thoughts can be racing away in many different directions, making connections, one thought leading to another and another. Often these thoughts lead to possible negative scenarios or memories of past events that have caused worry, emotional or physical pain. Mindfulness stops that. It creates a barrier between those runaway thoughts and your consciousness. It makes you more aware that this type of negative thinking is there in the first place. By doing this and slowing thoughts down at a given time, it lets you take a moment to just be, to experience a present moment and nothing else.  Mindfulness itself has also highlighted the strong connection between psychological problems and physical problems. In other words, how we think can have an effect on what we physically feel. This is why many people experiencing a condition such as chronic pain say practicing mindfulness helps them cope better with that pain. Is there any scientific evidence mindfulness works? There has been a number of controlled, scientific studies that have highlighted the positive effects of mindfulness. For example, a study by neuroscientists from Harvard University showed an eight-week program of mindfulness therapy produced changes in brain structure that were beneficial to patients. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, they revealed that participants practicing twenty seven minutes of mindfulness a day increased grey matter density in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is associated with compassion, self-awareness and introspection.  Meanwhile, the area of the brain that is associated with depression and anxiety, the amygdala, decreased in density. This made many patients more open to a positive way of thinking thus reducing stress, pain and/or depression. A similar study published in the British medical journal The Lancet concluded that MBCT was just as effective as drug treatment in preventing patients relapsing into depression. Mindfulness being a lot less expensive than medication means it’s both beneficial for patients and medical practitioners. How do you practice mindfulness? To begin the practice of mindfulness, find a quiet environment for yourself. Try to be as fully relaxed as you can be. Regulate your breathing. Become more aware of this breathing rhythm. As you breathe in and out, become aware of your senses. Don’t judge or think about them, just sense where you are in the present moment. Sense, for example, your body against the chair. The temperature of the room. Sounds you hear. What you smell. However, don’t let thoughts randomly enter your mind or wander off. Whenever you feel this is happening, bring your thoughts back to your breathing rhythm. Only sense that present moment where you’re practicing mindfulness. The aim here is to be in control of your thoughts, to make the present moment everything. Once you are only aware of the here and now, you are on your way to successfully practicing mindfulness. Incorporating mindfulness into your daily life. Although it can be helpful, it’s not necessary to be in a completely quiet environment to practise mindfulness. Once you learn the technique or, ideally, adapt a technique that’s best suited for yourself, you will be able to practice it almost anywhere. It could be while sitting on a bus or train, at work or during leisure time. Likewise, the amount of time a mindfulness session can last is up to you. For example, you could begin with short periods of around ten minutes a day and build up your time practicing mindfulness to forty minutes a day as you get used to it.  The more you practice mindfulness, the more beneficial it can be. Mindfulness is not a miracle cure for a number of psychological or physical conditions. It is, however, recognized more and more as a very effective help to anyone who wishes to lead a more stress-free life.

Seeing Future with Amazon Echo & Alexa: What to Expect. May 6, 2017 by Staff   Filed under Opinion, Tech/Internet, Weekly Columns 1 Comment Like Like Love Haha Wow Sad Angry 1 Tweet (ThyBlackMan.com) We are surrounded by devices like Amazon Echo, Echo Look, Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick and many other AI inspired gadgets. Our desire for smart homes and smart devices is rapidly growing, so as the demand for more advanced technologies. Since many companies have joined the artificial intelligence bandwagon, tech giant Amazon is not left behind. Its virtual voice assistant Alexa is reaching out to people with Echo and it won’t stop here. Amazon has some strong plans for the device’s future and here’s what you can expect from the company. Amazon Ruling Its Own Realm When Microsoft is ruling the PC world, Google and Apple are fighting the smartphone war, but Amazon created its own third platform with Alexa and Echo. Alexa connects devices that are beyond PCs and smartphones. It is connecting the devices that don’t even have screens. Surprisingly, Alexa is now being incorporated in some of the everyday life appliances and machineries such as refrigerator, cars and even LED lamps. Google, however, is trying to beat Amazon, but it looks like it’s too late. So, in its third platform which is very less saturated, Amazon has a lot of scope for development, design changes and innovation. Voice Search Is the Future Whether it’s a smartphone or a home security system, artificial intelligence advocates are promoting voice assistance more than ever. Changing music or surfing internet while driving is risky, and you know that. But just imaging if you can search, play and forward music by simply asking Alexa to do so. Imagine that how easy it would be to dig out necessary details from the internet by simply asking a virtual voice assistant. This is going to come true. Ford has already confirmed that its cars will be featuring Amazon’s Alexa support. LG has also confirmed that some of its future product to feature Alexa support. Asking you microwave or air conditioner to set temperature itself, and asking your TV set to play your favorite movie without having to find remote is possible with Alexa and many of these ideas are already in progress. More Than Just Voice Computing Alexa competes with many other digital voice assistants and the Amazon Echo has emerged as one of the leading voice assistants. But the company doesn’t want to keep the device limited to the voice commands. According to Amazon’s head scientist for Alexa, Rohit Prasad, the company is encouraging communications with machines. Conversations are something that connect, and machines can be more human-like if they are capable of having better conversations. At present, the standard Alexa Echo looks like a black tower with only sound capabilities. The company is reportedly working on a new version which will include a display system as well. If the leaked image from Amazon’s server is something to go by, Amazon Echo with display will look like a monitor with a speaker. Some reports, earlier this year, have already claimed that Amazon is working on a touchscreen Echo device. Amazon Is Giving More Power to Echo Amazon is planning to open a new research center in Cambridge for its scientists working on different technologies including Alexa which is used in Echo. The company also aims to expand its employee base, meaning that it will continue working with the devices like Echo which will accommodate Alexa. We have already seen Amazon Echo Look, which is capable of rating your apparels. So now, the technology is much advanced that it can turn out to be a reliable friend who can help you learn some good dressing sense and improve it. However, the entry of camera and voice recording capabilities have sparked discussions about safety, but when the technology gets advanced, we are left with no other option than choosing the ‘smart’ life or living a slow one. Bottom Line If everything goes well with Echo, the voice-based virtual assistance service will likely remain at the top position. To some extent, Amazon is strategically selling the benefits of Alexa to fashion conscious people. There are many people who still find Google Home and Echo not worthy enough to invest in, but as the consumers who purchase the new versions of Amazon Echo, for example Echo Look are being introduced to Alexa in a great way which is surely going to make them rely on the technology in the long run.

Mark the date: Android Wear 2.0 will arrive on February 9 Claire Bautista January 27, 2017 9:11 am TECHNOLOGY 1.7K 0 DUBAI – Google’s smartwatch Android Wear 2.0 will be launched on February 9. A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

Cameron, Defender Guest Writer Posted 13 hours ago Leave a comment 51 reads Mindfulness is a type of meditation that’s said to enhance emotional well-being. It’s become extremely popular in recent years, with major companies such as Google, Goldman Sachs and General Motors encouraging its practice amongst their employees. NASA, the US Olympic team and the Navy SEALs are just three organizations said to use this type of meditation as part of their training. Mindfulness has also been promoted by celebrities such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Kobe Bryant and Emma Watson. So what exactly is mindfulness and how is it practiced?  What exactly is mindfulness? Worry and anxiety often enter our minds via thinking about what has happened in the past or what may happen in the future. Mindfulness is a way of controlling this type of instinctive, yet negative thinking. By being fully focused on the present moment, it means you are not thinking about the past or future and the worries or anxieties that may accompany this. As such, practiced regularly, mindfulness is said to have long-term benefits on how to cope with the stresses of everyday life. What are the origins of mindfulness? The name mindfulness is a translation of the Sanskrit word for remembrance or awareness. It’s known mostly as a form of Buddhist meditation but is also thought to date back to ancient Hindu traditions 2,500 years ago. It has gained popularity and recognition in recent times, most notably through Jon Kabat-Zinn who introduced the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) Program at the University of Massachusetts in the late 1970’s. Mindfulness has continued to grow in popularity, becoming an accepted part of modern-day psychology. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is the most recent innovation of this stress-reducing technique, building on work achieved with MBSR. Who can benefit from practicing mindfulness? Mindfulness can be beneficial to anyone wishing to reduce stress and worry. It’s particularly helpful for people suffering from psychological conditions such as severe anxiety, depression and addiction. It’s also thought to help with physical ailments such as heart disease, gastrointestinal problems and chronic pain. This is, in part, because those suffering from medical conditions like depression and physical pain are more prone to negative thoughts. Mindfulness in more detail. Without realizing it, at any given moment, the brain is a hub of hyperactive mental activity. Thoughts can be racing away in many different directions, making connections, one thought leading to another and another. Often these thoughts lead to possible negative scenarios or memories of past events that have caused worry, emotional or physical pain. Mindfulness stops that. It creates a barrier between those runaway thoughts and your consciousness. It makes you more aware that this type of negative thinking is there in the first place. By doing this and slowing thoughts down at a given time, it lets you take a moment to just be, to experience a present moment and nothing else.  Mindfulness itself has also highlighted the strong connection between psychological problems and physical problems. In other words, how we think can have an effect on what we physically feel. This is why many people experiencing a condition such as chronic pain say practicing mindfulness helps them cope better with that pain. Is there any scientific evidence mindfulness works? There has been a number of controlled, scientific studies that have highlighted the positive effects of mindfulness. For example, a study by neuroscientists from Harvard University showed an eight-week program of mindfulness therapy produced changes in brain structure that were beneficial to patients. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, they revealed that participants practicing twenty seven minutes of mindfulness a day increased grey matter density in the hippocampus, the part of the brain that is associated with compassion, self-awareness and introspection.  Meanwhile, the area of the brain that is associated with depression and anxiety, the amygdala, decreased in density. This made many patients more open to a positive way of thinking thus reducing stress, pain and/or depression. A similar study published in the British medical journal The Lancet concluded that MBCT was just as effective as drug treatment in preventing patients relapsing into depression. Mindfulness being a lot less expensive than medication means it’s both beneficial for patients and medical practitioners. How do you practice mindfulness? To begin the practice of mindfulness, find a quiet environment for yourself. Try to be as fully relaxed as you can be. Regulate your breathing. Become more aware of this breathing rhythm. As you breathe in and out, become aware of your senses. Don’t judge or think about them, just sense where you are in the present moment. Sense, for example, your body against the chair. The temperature of the room. Sounds you hear. What you smell. However, don’t let thoughts randomly enter your mind or wander off. Whenever you feel this is happening, bring your thoughts back to your breathing rhythm. Only sense that present moment where you’re practicing mindfulness. The aim here is to be in control of your thoughts, to make the present moment everything. Once you are only aware of the here and now, you are on your way to successfully practicing mindfulness. Incorporating mindfulness into your daily life. Although it can be helpful, it’s not necessary to be in a completely quiet environment to practise mindfulness. Once you learn the technique or, ideally, adapt a technique that’s best suited for yourself, you will be able to practice it almost anywhere. It could be while sitting on a bus or train, at work or during leisure time. Likewise, the amount of time a mindfulness session can last is up to you. For example, you could begin with short periods of around ten minutes a day and build up your time practicing mindfulness to forty minutes a day as you get used to it.  The more you practice mindfulness, the more beneficial it can be. Mindfulness is not a miracle cure for a number of psychological or physical conditions. It is, however, recognized more and more as a very effective help to anyone who wishes to lead a more stress-free life. comments – Add Yours This Week’s CD!

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 05.06.17. 05.06.17 Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am Teflon Amazon, Where Bezos Gets Rich and Bad News Never Sticks Amazon.com founder and CEO Jeff Bezos.David Ryder/Getty Images Tech is enduring an industry-wide public relations crisis. Mark Zuckerberg just announced that Facebook will hire 3,000 people to screen Facebook Live videos for violence. Google has its own army of workers monitoring YouTube for extremism and other unsavory content; the search giant also launched an initiative aimed at ridding its search snippets of misinformation. Meanwhile, thanks to scandals ranging from Theranos to #juicegate to basically everything about Uber, the public now sees tech entrepreneurs not just as innovative underdogs but cruel moguls, con artists, or both. Related Stories Brian Barrett Amazon’s ‘Echo Look’ Could Snoop a Lot More Than Just Your Clothes Klint Finley The Amazon S3 Outage Is What Happens When One Site Hosts Too Much of the Internet Geoffrey A. Manne and Jennifer MacLean Sorry, But Amazon Isn’t Actually Annihilating Retail Jobs But Amazon has distinctly bucked the trend. While advertisers are asking Mark Zuckerberg why their money is subsidizing fake news and livestreamed murders, Amazon is racking up Oscars and Emmys. While investors are questioning why they should keep subsidizing Alphabet CEO Larry Page’s moonshots, Amazon’s share price ratchets ever higher despite the company’s relatively scant profits. In the process, CEO Jeff Bezos inches ever closer to becoming the world’s richest person while chasing dreams of drone deliveries and brick-and-mortar stores with no cashiers. Despite growing concerns about online privacy, Amazon has even convinced more than 11 million people to install an always-on recording device in their living —and may soon coax people into buying Amazon-connected cameras for their bedrooms as well. Amazon’s ability to evade blemishes owes itself in part to a less fraught business model. Amazon sells products and services to make money, not ads slapped on user-generated content. Not that controversy doesn’t touch Amazon. It’s just that none of it sticks. Like the Gipper, the company and its CEO Jeff Bezos seem to be covered in non-stick coating: teflon Amazon. Pleasing Everybody Amazon doesn’t create algorithmically generated newsfeeds read by billions of people. It doesn’t try to offer “one true answer” to people’s burning questions on its search results pages. By keeping its platform free of current events, it’s managed to largely avoid the fake news fracas that erupted after the 2016 election. Also, though it sells ads on its product pages, advertising is a relatively small source of Amazon’s revenue. So while Facebook and Google have to balance the needs of users, content creators, and advertisers, Amazon can focus primarily on its customers. Yes, Amazon also has to consider the needs of sellers and suppliers, but the decisions it makes are perhaps less delicate because there are fewer constituencies it needs to please. So long as the correct orders show up on time undamaged, Amazon’s customers are happy. The online retail giant has also been lucky. Amazon owns a video game-focused livestreaming site called Twitch, which apart from a few close calls has thus far managed to avoid broadcasting any high-profile murders or suicides. It seems like it’s only a matter of time until it plays host to some sort of tragedy. But until then, the hazards of livestreaming are Facebook’s PR problem, not Amazon’s. Neither luck nor its business model can completely explain Amazon’s ability to avoid the publicity crisis its peers face, however. Conditions for its warehouse workers are notoriously grueling, and in 2015 the New York Times reported that even its white collar workers are miserable. Amazon has long been accused of strong-arming book publishers and just settled an antitrust case in Europe over its e-book business. Earlier this year it finally started collected sales tax in five states where it had long avoided doing so1. Somehow none of these issues have haunted Amazon the way criticism of its labor practices have haunted Uber or the way antitrust accusations plagued Microsoft. Sure, its low prices and the convenience of two-day shipping could well be enough to keep customers buying from Amazon despite its controversies. But consumers don’t seem to view Amazon a bad guy at all. According to The Harris Poll, Amazon has a better reputation than any other well-known company in the US, edging out other tech companies like Apple and Google. Wal-Mart, another retailer that offers low prices, finds itself beset by labor-related controversies and ranks towards the bottom of the same list. Amazon’s ability to avoid the villain label probably owes something to Bezos’s obsession with the company’s image. In his book on Amazon, The Everything Store, Brad Stone uncovered a memo from Bezos describing the qualities of “cool” companies. Cool companies, according to Bezos, are polite, take risks, and take on bigger, less sympathetic companies. You can see those principles in play in Amazon’s generous return policy, the way it keeps rolling out new products and services, the way it took on incumbents like Barnes and Noble and Wal-Mart. So far it’s been able to avoid looking like a bully by constantly picking fights with companies that are bigger than it. The question is how long it can keep this up. When it runs out giants to topple, it could become the target of the next cool company. Maybe then its teflon coating will peel off. 1Correction at 9:30pm on 5/6/2017: An earlier version of this story said that Amazon collected sales tax in only five states. It now collects sales tax in all states that charge sales tax. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article. Amazon Media Skip Social. Skip to: Latest News. Share Share Tweet Comment Email Skip Social.

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Malaysia related news. Finally, I'm out of US internet. Duder12 No good Android News sites in Malaysia? MrLockermanMY There is but it isn't as popular as AP.

Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 143k 114k Latest Deals 19 [Deal Alert] Runtastic Road Bike Pro is free on the Play Store (down from $4.99) 2017/05/06 1:33am PDTMay 6, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 18 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

However, you shouldn’t buy one right now. With big curved screens and water resistance they are tempting options, but we’d recommend holding off for a little longer. Read on to find out why. Aside from the recalled Galaxy Note 7 Samsung had a strong year in 2016. This year though, things are looking even better. And although the upcoming Galaxy S8 release has been delayed it will be here soon enough. Along with countless other good choices in 2017. Read: Galaxy S8 Release: 5 Reasons to Wait for It & 3 Not To A little over a year after the Galaxy S7 release there are multiple reasons we’d say not to buy one right now. And that isn’t just because the Galaxy S8 is coming. In fact, there are severals reasons which we’ll explain below. If you need a phone right now go ahead, but you’ll be glad you waited if you do. Right now is a bad time to buy any of the great smartphones on the market. That goes for the iPhone, Google Pixel, or even the famous Galaxy S7. Now that we’re into 2017 an entire wave of new smartphones are on the horizon. We’re not saying wait and buy the Galaxy S8, but wait to see what options present themselves instead. Like LG G6 deals. Here is why you shouldn’t buy the Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge right now. Although by the end of this you may decide to get one anyways, which is perfectly fine. Lets get started. Galaxy S8 Release Date (and Galaxy S8 Plus) There are a number of reasons why we’d avoid buying the Galaxy S7 right now, but none are more apparent than the incoming Galaxy S8. Simply put, it will be Samsung’s best smartphone to date. The company is coming off a recall, have a lot to prove, all while preparing to release one stunning smartphone. Everything we’ve seen so far suggests it’s the most capable smartphone yet, and really shows what 2017 will be all about. This is the Samsung Galaxy S8 The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus will be the best of the S7 and Note 7.  All combined into one sleek device with a huge screen. Now we know, not everyone wants a big phone. And the Galaxy S8 will have a 5.8-inch screen, with a 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus. It sounds crazy, but they will be about the same size as past Samsung phones. As you can see from the image above, Samsung’s managed to slim the bezels down a ton. By making the bezel smaller and removing the fingerprint scanner to the back, the front is all screen. Add in double the storage, a great camera, big battery cells and more, this will be the phone to get. Read: Galaxy S8 Release: Everything We Know Right Now The only problem we see with waiting, is the delay. That’s because the Note 7 recall caused Samsung to be more cautious. They added an 8-point battery inspection and delayed the Galaxy S8 launch event to March 29th. Yes, that’s coming up quick. Still, you won’t be able to buy one until late April. It’ll be worth the wait though. Galaxy S8 Design Shows the iPhone’s age. So it will be later than any prior year, but worth it. If you don’t need a phone right this minute, and can wait another few months, it will be a great decision. These phones have a beautiful display and look pretty sharp. LG G6 Release If you can’t wait until April when we’re expecting the Galaxy S8 release, LG may have the perfect solution and timing. We know a lot of you may think about the LG G5 and instantly write off the LG G6, but stay with us for a minute. For 2017 LG completely changed their approach to the smartphone market. They’ve added a premium all glass and metal design, water-resistance, and a similar tiny bezel to a huge screen. It has a 5.7-inch screen with rounded edges like the Galaxy S8, improved dual cameras on back, and it’s water-resistant too. This is the year LG might finally take on Samsung, which is one more reason it could be a better choice than the Galaxy S7. Sadly the LG G6 has the same processor as the Google Pixel (which is still fast, but not a 2017 model) and only 32GB of storage. That said, everything else about it puts it in the same high-tier as upcoming Samsung phones, and the iPhone 8. Read: LG G6 Release Date Breakdown For those unaware, the LG G6 is available right now for pre-order. Our link above has all the details. Get one from Verizon starting March 30th, or all other US carriers on April 7th. It’s also available right now in South Korea. More details about the LG G6 can be found right here. HTC U Ultra While it only has a few improvements overall, the new HTC U Ultra is another option worth considering. Everything about it slightly nudges out the Galaxy S7 on paper, aside from maybe battery life. It also has a beautiful design similar to the Galaxy S7, while rocking a huge 5.7-inch display. Then a second screen above it, like an LG. The HTC U Ultra has a sleek new premium design, good camera, fingerprint scanner, and that second screen is actually pretty helpful. It’s a bit expensive starting at $749, and it isn’t being sold by carriers, so get one unlocked if you’re interested. The reviews haven’t been the best, but HTC fans should enjoy all it has to offer. It’s better than the Galaxy S7, it just won’t be able to compete with some of the flagship phones in 2017. Still, it’s a consideration, and that’s what we’re here for. Other Competition For the sake of time, and because they likely won’t be here until summer or later, everything else will be added to this last category. We’re talking about the OnePlus 5, which should be the best $449 smartphone on the planet when it’s released. The OnePlus 3 was excellent. Yes, they’re rumored to be taking on Samsung and skipping four. Going right to five. Additionally Lenovo in charge of Motorola has big plans for their smartphones of 2017. We could see another Moto X along with a new and improved modular Moto Z of some sort. Furthermore, both LG and HTC have mentioned they’ll have another flagship phone this summer. Reason for the late arrival is Samsung took all the new Snapdragon 835 platform processors for their phone. Which is the computing platform that makes these phones so capable and powerful. Think an early arrival of the LG V30, and a new HTC 11. iPhone 8 Concept And while it may not run Android, this will be a huge year for Apple. It marks their 10 year anniversary since the first iPhone. We could see an iPhone 7s, or the company could jump straight to the iPhone 8. There are some beautiful renders floating around too. Not to mention the rumored iPhone X. It’s an idea, right? Last but not least though, is Google. In 2016 the first phone “made inside and out” by Google was released. Called the Pixel and Pixel XL. Many have called it the best Android smartphone ever, or of the year. And while it didn’t get everything right, for their first try it was extremely impressive. This is the Google Pixel XL We have big hopes and expectations from Google in 2017 with the Pixel 2. From a stunning new bezel-free phone, to water-resistance and a world class camera. There are even some rumors floating around already. In 2016 the Google Pixel had the highest rated smartphone camera ever released, and it ran Android 7.0 Nougat before anything else. The possibilities are endless, and Google is in an excellent position to jump near the top of the marketshare. Expect big things from a Google Pixel 2 running Android O in October or so. Read: Android O Release: What You Need to Know So Far At the end of the day it really comes down to a users needs, wants and preferences. If you need a phone right now, the Galaxy S7 Edge is still great. However, so is the OnePlus 3T for a lower price. Or the upcoming LG G6. Not to mention the highly exciting Galaxy S8 lineup. Sometimes getting a phone when you find a deal is nice, but it often pays to wait. And that will be more true than ever in 2017. Not to mention Galaxy S7 deals will be everywhere in a few months. Give it a little time, wait to see what’s available, and then make the best choice for you. One Response 05/06/2017 Burns Reply Way to much “JUNK ” on the Edge.!!

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 143k 114k Latest Deals 19 [Deal Alert] Runtastic Road Bike Pro is free on the Play Store (down from $4.99) 2017/05/06 1:33am PDTMay 6, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 18 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Posts: 1 Joined: 05/17 Posted: 05/04/17 03:42 AM By way of introduction, I know nothing about Chevy engine rebuilds. Two days with Google is about it.  I don't know any of the jargon or engineering. I'm not (yet) seeking advice on the specific technicals of my rebuild, brands and models of parts, but on what kind of general direction I should go.  There are so many ways to do a SBC rebuild, that the starting direction is almost a philosophical question more than a technical problem.  Too many choices. My situation:  I have bought an old exotic car which has a Gen I 350 Chevy transplant. This is not ideal from a purist point of view, but I'm not a purist, and it's there! The other unusual part of my situation is that I live in a place where engine transplants are essentially forbidden.  There seems to be an exemption for changes done over 30 years ago, which this seems to be, so I can probably do a rebuild what I have, but I can't change the block.  So, a crate engine is not an option, nor can I do any other engine swap.  The other alternative is to put in the original model of engine, which is spectacularly expensive. So, this question assumes that I have high goals, but *must* start with this old block. The block I have ends with code TDR, which I believe makes it a 1972 350 from a K-10 or K-20 pickup. The car will be redone to be pleasant for touring.  I live in Europe, so it's nice to travel around by road.  Not for racing, just driving fast on nice roads. So, what do I want from the rebuild?  Any design choices are always tradeoffs among * driveability * reliability * peak power * performance profile:  torque curve, responsiveness * cost I want an engine that is *extremely* reliable and a joy to drive, with as much performance as I can get within that constraint, and, to whatever extent it can be done. I'd like to be able to head out on a 2000 mile trip with no thought of the engine bay, nothing but oil and standard tune ups for the next 15 years. Also, the ideal is a bit of the "feel" of a European performance engine.  I know I can't get  7000 RPM, but some design choices will be more or less consistent with that goal. The good news is that I'm not particularly sensitive to what it will cost.  The rebuild will be so vastly less expensive than putting in the original model of engine that I'll be ahead no matter what I do to the Chevy.  From what little I have read, it seems you can do an awful lot with $10-15k. Here is where it gets tricky:  I would like, so far as possible, to get a bit that exotic car feel.  To me, this means that the ideal would be maybe 80% of peak torque down low (2000ish), rising slowly to a relatively high RPM peak torque (5000ish?). Yes, I'm speaking of rising torque, not just rising power. The down low is for real world driving, I can pootle around in traffic at 1800 RPM if necessary, and the rising torque curve is to give that sense of eagerness when I do push down on the throttle. It's a subtle thing:  the sense that, even if you don't want or need to rev high, the engine gives you the impression that it is eager and willing to do so. In effect, I imagine that tuning a Chevy for relatively high torque peak will do some of this, as there are enough cubes that low-down torque will probably always be fine, provided it is firing smoothly. Ideally I want it to be smooth as butter, with a smooth idle, minimized hot rod V8 thump-bump sound. I am happy to give up some peak power for those things, though of course everybody wants as much power as they can get within the constraints. Maybe an X-connected exhaust would help. Given my enthusiasm for smoothness and reliability, my plan is to have full modern EFI with port injection, probably&preferably distributorless ignition. I assume that absolutely everything but the block will be replaced, but that the displacement will probably be unchanged within rounding error. Other misc information: * right now the engine starts, but that's about the limit of its capabilities. * 95 octane gas is not a problem around here, and I can usually get 98. * I don't mind a relatively high idle, so long as it's smooth. * The rebuild is being done near Toronto. * There is a height constraint in the engine bay.  It's OK with the current 2-barrel and oval air cleaner, but it can't go too much higher.  I don't have the exact measurement right now, but there will be no hood scoop. * I plan to have a nice new rad and 2 electric fans. * I plan to add air conditioning. * Current plan is a brand new transmission.  Probably Tremec TKO-500, as it is very adaptable. * It won't actually get driven very many miles per year.  It's not my only car. So...what direction should I take for the build? What sorts of things will alter the torque curve a bit in the direction I want, so far as possible with the other goals? Should I start with a compression ratio target first? What should I tell my shop to look for  when they are making component selection decisions? Are there particular styles of kit that seem most suited to these goals? Thanks for reading this far...

Celcom will be the first Malaysian carrier to use Google Jibe RCS Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 8:32am PDTMay 6, 2017 4 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares129 Carriers Google News The first carrier to support Google's Jibe RCS technology was Sprint, back in November of last year. Since then, several carriers in Canada, Asia, and Europe have made the switch. Now it looks like Celcom will support Jibe RCS, becoming the first carrier in Malaysia to do so. If you need a refresher, RCS is designed to replace SMS, with features like read receipts and high-quality media sharing. Similar to different email services 'talking' to each other, different RCS clouds are inter-operable as long as they use the RCS Universal Profile. Thus, anyone on a carrier supporting Jibe RCS or another Universal Profile cloud can use the technology. Celcom did not provide a timeline on when Jibe RCS would be fully rolled out to its customers, but hopefully it won't be too long.

Malaysia related news. Finally, I'm out of US internet. Duder12 No good Android News sites in Malaysia? MrLockermanMY There is but it isn't as popular as AP. Emmammeadows Have you ever earned lots of money without offering for sale a thing and even without working on any mlm marketing sort of business without having to make an investment any-thing.

I'm getting big profits from home from this work exactly like $20000 every month and sometimes more and if you also actually want to get paid same as that then follow these particular not very difficult directions by looking at this homepage .... ➤➤➤http:[email protected] ... Duder12 Fuck TMobile for delaying their rollout by switching to Samsung's RCS ProductFRED Samsung RCS works with Google's/Universal. It's just that they prefer Samsung's backend infrastructure for whatever reason. None of this makes a difference to the user experience. Duder12 Did you even read my post? I dont give a shit who they use. Fuck TMobile for **delaying** their rollout by ProductFRED I understand your frustration, but there's got to be a good reason for it. Also, as someone who uses multiple pieces of Google software daily at work (many of them enterprise-level), I can tell you that Google's products are in perpetual beta. They're buggy, and they change features every 5 minutes, and their Enterprise support kind of sucks. eddiepearson Wait what? Where did you read this? You have to be kidding right? We were supposed to get it like 3 months ago....What's the timeline now? If Sprint wasn't such crap, I'd switch in a heart beat. TMO is on thin ice with me. MJ Fucking Android Police... There is more to the world than Malaysia. Any news on the roll out of RCS in Uruguay? vzwuser76 And what about the 5G rollout in Atlantis? I guarantee Arthur Curry is feeling left out. AP really needs to expand their coverage. Borgman Can another answer these RCS questions.... Can I use Textra and someone else use a different SMS client, will RCS be working? As in 'reading, typing, etc' shows up. What about me using Textra and someone else using iMessage? And I just found out how much Allo compresses images (pisses me off), will RCS not compress since it's 10MB limit? Or will it still compress for some ungodly reason? What if Verizon uses RCS, but not the universal profile, will RCS still work for someone on verizon sending to Sprint? And would you have to use Verizon's messagin app for RCS to work? Is that a serious concern? Or will SMS clients (Textra) be able to implement RCS? Corbin Davenport As far as I know, Google has not released any kind of API for RCS, so Textra hasn't (and can't) add support until they do. I'm not sure about image compression. The Verizon/Sprint example you used wouldn't work, because Verizon's RCS implementation doesn't use the Universal Profile. I can't really answer the app question, but I do know that Android Messages supports more than just Jibe RCS. Vodafone is still using their own RCS implementation (that supports the Universal Profile), but that works with Android Messages. Borgman So if Verizon decides to use a different RCS profile, it won't work with ANYONE if they aren't on Verizon? :( Corbin Davenport Correct. Borgman Ugh that hurts. Big time. Ughhhh Eric Walker Does Verizon even have an rcs profilel? Last I checked they said rcs was stupid and made their own app. Jayson Stephenson That's just it. Verizon does utilize RCS (I don't know if you can call it a profile tho) but it's proprietary to people that are on their carrier only. And must use their messenger (Verizon Messages) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Ns9oV0Dh8_S5M-JHDvJ8sNHR6rpbiq2N6qZlP3g9zQ/edit#gid=0 Eric Walker Is that really even fit to be called rcs then? It sounds more to me like an instant messaging service like iMessage Jayson Stephenson Technically you would be correct. But it helps people that don't fully understand it know how it works. Eric Walker Also, wow. That's a great spreadsheet, it's cool that whoever made this has taken the time to get everything down in one place simply. Jayson Stephenson Thanks ;-) It's mine. Borgman That it the worst news lol. MUST use their messaging app and nothing else. Basically defeats the purpose of RCS across different devices and carriers. Jayson Stephenson Don't feel so down, once the API's are released and T-Mobile rolls-out RCS. Any other US-based carriers will start feeling the pressure from it's users not being able to utilize the neat features. I think it will happen sooner or later. senoredusty That's not a real concern though, as Verizon is one of the backers of the UP :-) it's just a matter of when Jayson Stephenson Google is not the one we are waiting for to release any API's. It's the GSMA. http://www.gsma.com/futurenetworks/universal-profile/ Which is stated to release Quarter two of this year (So between now and July 1st) MrLockermanMY does a mvno that rides on host network that supports rcs also supports rcs? Jayson Stephenson An MVNO can implement RCS almost the exact same way any other main carrier does. They have to sign-up on the cloud (Unless they create their own infrastructure which is super unlikely). http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2013/05/03/mvnos-can-benefit-from-rcs-too/ JG My understanding, if the parent network implements RCS on it's network, the MVNO(s) using the host's network will not automatically gain access to the host's RCS. The MVNO would have to set up their own RCS system, which they could do independent of their host. So an MVNO could have RCS even if it's host provider does not or presumably offer a different RCS. Which leads one to wonder... If Google is pushing all of these various carriers to support Google's own RCS standard... The obvious question.... Why doesn't Google's Project Fi support Google's RCS yet??? Especially with the running gag being that using Google products means we're beta testers... One might argue that Google's own carrier would have been the perfect testing ground for their RCS. A relatively small subscriber base (most of which probably with above average tech skills, able to cope with beta testing a new feature) with a limited number of supported devices... In @jaysonstephenson:disqus's linked article, it mentions RCS will work on cellular and WiFi data. If it accepts data from external, non-carrier controlled networks, then it, presumably at least, should be able to handle Fi's multi-carrier approach without too much issue. Jayson Stephenson You put it in better words than I could. I believe the reason why we don't see carriers like Project Fi or many MVNO's using RCS yet is because they are still using data from the MNO's tower's. I think if Project Fi were to get RCS they would have to get permission from the other 3 carriers to zero-rate the services so they can still use the "Unlimited Messaging" claim without it being deducted from our bill. MrLockermanMY thank you @JG42:disqus and @jaysonstephenson:disqus for explanation :) Nogib RCS on Sprint was great...right up to the point it stopped working beginning of April and I haven't seen it come back to my phone yet. :( Follow Android Police 1.49M 467k 143k 114k Latest Deals 19 [Deal Alert] Runtastic Road Bike Pro is free on the Play Store (down from $4.99) 2017/05/06 1:33am PDTMay 6, 2017 0 [Deal Alert] Costco offering cash cards, charging kits, and more for Galaxy S8/S8+ activations 2017/05/05 6:53pm PDTMay 5, 2017 3 [Deal Alert] Fossil smartwatches discounted 25% everywhere 2017/05/05 11:36am PDTMay 5, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Finish off the week with 44 temporarily free and 12 on-sale apps 2017/05/05 9:06am PDTMay 5, 2017 18 [Update: Groupon] Deal Alert: Bragi's truly wireless earbuds, The Dash, are $100 on Woot for a refurbished pair ($200 off) 2017/05/05 1:10am PDTMay 5, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A #SocialSkim: Twitter's Livestream News and Live Shows, YouTube's New Design: 10 Stories This Week by Christian Neri  |   May 6, 2017  |  100 views Tweet Kindle Email Top This week's 'Skim sees Facebook and Twitter dominating the social media conversation. Twitter took to its first NewFronts to showcase its plans to live-stream 24/7 and woo advertisers; YouTube previewed its new facelift; Facebook is testing QR codes for in-store rewards redemption, launches Instant Games on Messenger; Google+ introduced searchable topics and themes. Also: learn three steps to building Facebook Messenger ads, why brands use social listening tools, and much more... Skim to stay on top of your social media game! 1. Twitter partners with Bloomberg for 24/7 news service, with Buzzfeed and Viacom for more Twitter is all about what's happening now, and its newest project with Bloomberg shows the company's out to prove it. Last week we filled you in on Twitter's plans to eventually stream live content 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, and now it seems Bloomberg is ready to dive in to help the social network accomplish just that. The financial news network will create a unique, 'round-the-clock program consisting of live reporting from various bureaus around the world, as well as verified user-generated content from Twitter users. Video has been Twitter's highest source of advertising revenue, so we can probably expect to see similar endeavors down the road. Check out all of Twitter's announcements, including about new live shows with Buzzfeed and Viacom. 2. YouTube previews its new design The Google-owned video Site is letting users preview its new design, optimized for simplicity, consistency, and beauty, according to one of the company's product managers. Based on Material Design, the new look also includes an optional dark theme both to provide users with a better viewing experience and to reduce glare. The design will be consistent throughout Google platforms, including YouTube's mobile app. Want to preview the new design? Navigate over to www.youtube.com/new and let us know what you think. 3. Facebook testing rewards QR codes in mobile app A new Rewards section within the More tab of Facebook's mobile app has appeared for a group of users, as the social network tests a feature for scanning personalized QR codes while customers are physically in stores in order to redeem discounts or bonuses. The addition could pave the path for Facebook to incorporate brand loyalty programs into its platform, and to better connect businesses with their consumers while they're physically in-store. Such features could also open the door to beacon-like technology that could have Facebook alerting shoppers to available discounts or coupons based on physical location and more. The sky's the limit... Will you be prepared? 4. Google+ now lets members browse public posts and more based on themes Google+ has added a Topics feature, letting users search and browse for public posts, Communities, and Collections based on themes or interests. Users' home streams will now feature a Topics section, which covers everything from sports and animals to photography; they can click to discover posts made by public profiles, as well as connect with like-minded people by joining the Communities or Collections that surface based on any given Topic. The addition is rolling out to users now. 5. Twitter's getting serious about reversing its advertising woes The social network headed to its first ever NewFronts to showcase its grand plans in video in an effort to lure advertisers away from other platforms. Although Twitter's user growth increased in its most recent quarterly report, Twitter's ad revenue hit a two-year low last quarter, so the company is pitching advertisers with ambitious media partnerships to feature livestreaming content around the clock. Challenging brand-safe spaces like television where content is heavily regulated, Twitter faces challenges in convincing advertisers that their ads won't appear among the onslaught of objectionable content that exists online. Despite the progress Twitter has made in the last year, and faced up against Facebook's 2 billion monthly active users, Twitter faces an upward battle to convince advertisers that its 328 million monthly active users are worth both the risk and investment. 6. Facebook launches Instant Games worldwide Facebook has formally begun rolling out its Instant Games, originally announced in November 2016, to users across the world: Pac-Man, Words with Friends, and more just became accessible to all of the social network's users who have the Messenger mobile app installed. Instant Games is rolling out on both Android and iOS, and it should be available to all users in the coming weeks. Facebook is bolstering its Messenger platform to provide even more reason for advertisers to place ads and for users to spend more time within the app. 7. Three steps to creating a Facebook Messenger ad There's a new way to engage prospects on Facebook that you probably haven't taken advantage of yet. Facebook Messenger ads appear on the Facebook News Feed, but users who click are redirected to the Messenger app, where they're subsequently able to ask a company a question, get feedback, or redeem a reward. Social Media Examiner has a step-by-step guide to developing relationships and potentially opening up new revenue streams using the Messenger ad format—from defining your custom audience and choosing the right call to action for your goal, to creating the ad and launching the campaign. 8. You can now use Reactions on Facebook comments Facebook users now have five new emotions to express themselves with when reacting to comments on posts. The social network is rolling out the ability for users to use the same five Reactions on comments that users can use for posts: love, haha, wow, sad, and angry. Facebook added Reactions to the News Feed in February 2016 and to Messenger in March 2017; it already counts 300 billion uses by users since those launches. 9. Why brands use social listening tools A recent report from Clutch gives us some deeper insights into why brands are using social media listening tools, proving the value brands find in having a ear on social conversations. The main purpose for a brand's use of social listening software is to improve customer service, while reaching new customers and staying ahead of competition rank second and third, respectively, as the most common purposes. But what do these same marketers feel is the primary benefit of using such tools? Check out the MarketingProfs recap to find out. 10. We'll wrap up with Facebook's hiring spree in the wake of livestreamed murders The social network has run into its fair share of controversy after its Facebook Live feature was used in multiple instances to live-stream shootings, hate speech, murders, and other crimes. Facebook is ready to fire back, and it's hiring 3,000 new employees to keep to monitor the platform for harmful videos and content. Facebook already has 4,500 employees working in a similar capacity, but it's also been working on ways to streamline the reporting process for users to flag objectionable content and make it easier for the social network's monitoring team to contact law enforcement when necessary. Between accusations of playing host to fake news that can derail governments to serving as a place for criminals to livestream their crimes, Facebook faces a burden unlike anything it's seen before.

Follow Raw Story! Follow @rawstory In the early years of the internet, it was revolutionary to have a world of information just a click away from anyone, anywhere, anytime. Many hoped this inherently democratic technology could lead to better-informed citizens more easily participating in debate, elections and public discourse. Today, though, many observers are concerned that search algorithms and social media are undermining the quality of online information people see. They worry that bad information may be weakening democracy in the digital age. The problems include online services conveying fake news, splitting users into “filter bubbles” of like-minded people and enabling users to unwittingly lock themselves up in virtual echo chambers that reinforce their own biases. These concerns are much discussed, but have not yet been thoroughly studied. What research does exist has typically been limited to a single platform, such Twitter or Facebook. Our study of search and politics in seven nations – which surveyed the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain in January 2017 – found these concerns to be overstated, if not wrong. In fact, many internet users trust search to help them find the best information, check other sources and discover new information in ways that can burst filter bubbles and open echo chambers. Surveying internet users We sought to learn directly from people about how they used search engines, social media and other sources of information about politics. Through funding from Google, we conducted an online survey of more than 14,000 internet users in seven nations. We found that the fears surrounding search algorithms and social media are not irrelevant – there are problems for some users some of the time. However, they are exaggerated, creating unwarranted fears that could lead to inappropriate responses by users, regulators and policymakers. The importance of searching The survey findings demonstrate the importance of search results over other ways to get information. When people are looking for information, they very often search the internet. Nearly two-thirds of users across our seven nations said they use a search engine to look for news online at least once a day. They view search results as equally accurate and reliable as other key sources, like television news. In line with that general finding, a search engine is the first place internet users go online for information about politics. Moreover, those internet users who are very interested in politics, and who participate in political activities online, are the most likely to use a search engine like Bing or Google to find information online about politics. But crucially, those same users engaged in search are also very likely to get information about politics on other media, exposing themselves to diverse sources of information, which makes them more likely to encounter diverse viewpoints. Further, we found that people who are interested and involved in politics online are more likely to double-check questionable information they find on the internet and social media, including by searching online for additional sources in ways that will pop filter bubbles and break out of echo chambers. Internet-savvy or not? It’s not just politically interested people who have these helpful search habits: People who use the internet more often and have more practice searching online do so as well. That leaves the least politically interested people and the least skilled internet users as most susceptible to fake news, filter bubbles and echo chambers online. These individuals could benefit from support and training in digital literacy. However, for most people, internet searches are critical for checking the reliability and validity of information they come across, whether online, on social media, on traditional media or in everyday conversation. Our research shows that these internet users find search engines useful for checking facts, discovering new information, understanding others’ views on issues, exploring their own views and deciding how to vote. International variations We found that people in different countries do vary in how much they trust and rely on the internet and searches for information. For example, internet users in Germany, and to a lesser extent those in France and the United Kingdom, are more trusting in TV and radio news, and more skeptical of searches and online information. Internet users in Germany rate the reliability of search engines lower than those in all the other nations, with 44 percent saying search engines are reliable, compared with 50 to 57 percent across the other six countries. In Poland, Italy and Spain, people trust traditional broadcast media less and are more reliant on, and trusting of, internet and searching. Americans are in the middle; there were greater differences within European countries than between Europe as a whole and the U.S. American internet users were so much more likely to consult multiple sources of information that we called them “media omnivores.” Internet users generally rely on a diverse array of sources for political information. And they display a healthy skepticism, leading them to question information and check facts. Regulating the internet, as some have proposed, could undermine existing trust and introduce new questions about accuracy and bias in search results. But panic over fake news, echo chambers and filter bubbles is exaggerated, and not supported by the evidence from users across seven countries. William H.

Meaning users can’t pull the battery if it’s frozen or acting up. As a result, this quick guide will explain how to reset a frozen Nexus 5x or Nexus 6P that’s not performing right, or experiencing problems. At the end of September Google unveiled not one but two new Nexus smartphones for 2015. Those being the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Both are excellent smartphones with great cameras, front facing speakers, fingerprint scanners, and even the Nexus 6P has a 5.7-inch Quad-HD screen and a premium metal design. They’re great phones, but some users may have the occasional issue. Read: How to Delete Your Nexus 6P Browser History This doesn’t happen often, but many old Samsung or LG owners are used to just pulling out the battery for a minute or two. A trick that solves almost all most minor problems users and family members often ask me about. That isn’t an option here, so if your phone is frozen below are the simple steps to reset it. Both of Google’s new phones run the latest Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow that’s as fast and fluid as any operating system they’ve ever released. It’s faster, more efficient, more secure, and has better battery life thanks to some new features. Each phone also has powerful processors with 2 or 3GB of RAM, plenty of storage, cameras that are worth using, and finally a first for any Nexus — good battery life. And while the phones are blazing fast and usually don’t have any issues, some owners may occasionally have some problems that can’t be fixed. We haven’t seen too many reports of the Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P freezing, but if they do, here’s how to solve it. Instructions Just like the Galaxy S6, the iPhone and many other phones where the battery can’t be accessed, holding down a certain button for an extended amount of time is all that’s needed. If the phone is starting to slow down or act funny, hit the recent apps menu and close unused running apps. However, if things are completely frozen here’s what to do. Press and hold the power button for 8 seconds Let it reboot Users are instructed to push and hold down the power button for at least 8 seconds, and the phone will perform what’s called a soft reboot. It could take nearly 10 seconds, but typically eight or so is all that’s needed. The phone will turn off, reboot, and should start-up and work just as it should. Push and Hold Power for 8 Seconds If there’s something else wrong problems could persist. Try closing running apps, uninstalling anything new, or putting it on the charger in case it’s getting low. Sometimes phones can also struggle if there isn’t enough storage. Read: How to Close or Clear Apps on the Nexus 6P The base Nexus 5X only has 16GB of storage and no micro-SD slot. So if users filled it up, things could be acting slow. As a result you may need to uninstall some big apps or games, delete old photos or video, and clear up some space so things are working smooth again. Head into settings > storage > and see how much is left. This is different than booting into recovery mode, which is another route users can take and clear the cache at the same time, but that’s for another day. Typically a quick hold of power for eight seconds and a reboot is all that’s needed. Drop us a comment below if you’re having other problems. One Response 05/06/2017 Louis van der Zalm Reply The problem is that my Nexus 5x after the upgrade to 7.1.1 and after doing things in the settingsmenu it is going to reboot. Als it does not recognize my fingerprint. so when i do a soft reboot and then goes into the settingsmenu (for example trying to make a fingerprint -entry) after a while my nexus is gooing t reboot. It keeps rebooting for ever il I pushed the on/off button. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

It’s a garden-variety tussle, but for some reason Williams loses the head completely and throws Llorente to the ground. The striker gets up and does the Why?! mime. Williams thinks about escalating the situation. The referee steps in. Very strange, because this match has been played in good spirit, despite the tension. Ashley Williams grabs Fernando Llorente before throwing him to the ground.

Not quite. The young right-back tries again. This time Mawson hacks clear. It’s attack versus defence, though. Davies makes good down the right and hoicks one inside. Fer heads upfield, but Baines latches onto the clearance, takes a touch and shoots. The shot flies over the bar.

He cuts inside and from the right-hand edge of the D smashes an unstoppable shot ... into the side netting. Had that been on target, Fabianski would have had no chance, so sweetly was it struck. But Swansea survive. Hearts in mouths there, though, with the home side so close to three precious points in their fight to avoid the drop. Romelu Lukaku looks frustrated after missing a chance.

Fer opens his body up and lets fly with a sidefoot. Stekelenburg somehow manages to parry it. The ball clanks back off Williams and out of play for a corner, which isn’t much of an event.

Llorente nearly wins a towering header on the edge of the box, but Williams does enough. Right now, Swansea are struggling to hold the ball up in the final third, more often than not. Everton are on top, a state of affairs that’s emphasised when Lukaku once again causes merry hell down the right wing, but can’t quite find a team-mate in the centre. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.44pm EDT 13:44 56 min: And this was nearly 1-1, as Lukaku sashays down the right and whips a low ball straight through the Swansea area. The ball somehow evades both Davies and Mirallas, and flies out of play to the left of the goal. Any touch and that was surely in. Speaking of touches, just before that move Britton slid in very hard on Gueye, and was very fortunate to escape a booking.

Llorente cuts in from the wing and lashes a shot which turns into a cross. The ball hits Mawson, still up from the corner, and drops to Ayew on the penalty spot. Ayew, leaning back slightly, swings a leg and scuffs a shot onto the outside of the right-hand post and away. Stekelenburg was rooted to the spot, so had Ayew connected properly, that was 2-0.

Ross Barkley replaces Dominic Calvert-Lewin. His team-mates get the ball rolling. And in lieu of action, here’s Mac Millings to fill a space: “If I’ve done the maths right (and let’s be honest here), the mighty Hornets’ 3-0 reversal at the home of the Champions makes them one goal better than Manchester City, and as such, puts them in the driving seat for a Champions League spot for the first time in their illustrious history - finally making up for the 1984 Cup Final heartbreak, when, to quote Gary Naylor himself: ‘Cheating Andy Gray unfairly headed the ball out of Steve Sherwood’s innocent hands, thus delivering the trophy to an utterly undeserving (and highly overrated) journeyman Everton side.’ But I’m over it.” Hopefully Naylor’s at the theatre and/or can’t be bothered to respond.

(Credit: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) × DOJ Launches Criminal Investigation Into Uber Over Tool Built to Help Drivers Dodge Law Enforcement The logo of the ride-sharing service Uber in front of its headquarters in San Francisco. (Credit: Justin Sullivan / Getty Images) Last week, Uber teased ambitious plans to develop a network of flying cars by 2020. The press event briefly redirected the media’s attention to the skies at a time when Uber is bombarded with PR crises on the ground. But the wheel of PR misfortune has resumed spinning. Uber is now reportedly the subject of a criminal probe from the Department of Justice over a tool it built to help drivers dodge law enforcement in cities like Portland, Oregon, where Uber was not allowed. Uber and the Justice Department declined to comment on the investigation. “We support the criminal investigation by the United States Department of Justice into Uber’s use of the Greyball tool to evade regulators, and will continue to move forward with our own efforts to subpoena the requested records from Uber,” Portland Commissioner Dan Saltzman said in a statement. The ride-hailing startup also entered the courtroom this week to defend itself against charges it stole trade secrets and intellectual property for its self-driving car business from Google’s Waymo. The case risks undermining what Uber describes as “potentially … the most lucrative business in history.” And if that’s not enough, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick recently bailed on appearing at a big tech conference amid an ongoing internal investigation into sexual harassment allegations made by a former employee. Call it the new normal for Uber. Once the unstoppable darling of Silicon Valley, the startup has been tripped up by a series of stumbles this year. It is now besieged by lawsuits, executive departures, resurgent competitors and bad headlines. “Public perception is shaken,” Mike Walsh, an early Uber investor, told CNNTech. “But I’m hopeful and confident that’ll come back.” The damage has been months in the making. Uber was hit by a viral boycott in late January after it was perceived as breaking up a strike of taxi drivers who were protesting President Trump’s travel ban. The next month it launched an “urgent” investigation in response to sexual harassment allegations. Weeks later, Kalanick was caught on camera arguing with an Uber driver. Along the way, there have been a series of executive departures, including president Jeff Jones, who quit because of concerns over the firm’s management culture, and Rachel Whetstone, head of policy and communications. It “sends a bad signal to other employees and potential hires,” Walsh said. “A company can’t grow and excel without top talent, so this is concerning to me.” Meanwhile, some of Uber’s competitors are benefiting from its stumbles. Lyft, Uber’s top rival in the U.S., recently raised $600 million in funding and said it experienced a 60% increase in new passenger signups the week after the Uber boycott. “Lyft was doing well before Uber shot itself in the foot,” Michael Moe, a Lyft investor, told CNNTech in an interview last month. “But certainly those issues at Uber… have created an acceleration to Lyft’s business.” That doesn’t mean Uber’s drivers are suddenly fleeing the service. Harry Campbell, a driver for Uber and Lyft who runs a popular blog for drivers in the industry, said “Uber is just as busy as ever for drivers.” But the string of public setbacks does raise questions about Uber’s long-awaited IPO. It has raised more than $10 billion in funding. The company has stayed vague on timing for going public, but IPO expert Lise Buyer suggests its valuation could take a hit when it does. “Can a company with a black eye or five go public? Depending on what those errors were and how convincingly the problems have been solved, absolutely yes,” said Buyer, an IPO adviser with Class V Group who helped take Google public. “But, generally, there is a cost.” 45.523062 -122.676482 Trademark and Copyright 2017 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

The new Q, collaboratively designed with acclaimed National Geographic photographer Cory Richards, keeps in that tradition and runs Android Wear 2.0 to boot. Hardware | Richards has long been a fan of Fossil, and this model, though part of the Q Marshal collection, is based on the Fossil Blue he wore in his twenties. It’s definitely a looker — the stainless steel design feels every bit as premium as it looks, and with both a metal and leather strap included in the box, you can adjust it to whichever style best matches your outfit and preference on a given day. It’s also IP67 dust and water resistant, something an outdoorsman like Richards will appreciate. The notched bezel and crown look great, but they don’t do anything. It’s always nice to see a round display on a smartwatch, though much like the Moto 360, the Fossil Q bares a “flat tire” at the bottom to hold the ambient sensors. The display itself has a 360 x 360 resolution and looks … fine. It’s not particularly vivid or well-suited for outdoor viewing, and other smartwatches like Samsung’s Gear S3 certainly look nice, but it gets the job done. Still better than a Pebble (RIP), right? With a 45mm casing and coming in at 14mm thick, it’s a pretty sizeable watch. That large casing houses some decent specs, though: 4GB internal storage, 512MB RAM, Qualcomm’s Snapdragon Wear 2100 chipset, a gyroscope, and more. What I found frustrating about the design of the watch were the notched bezel around the display, and the crown to the side. Don’t get me wrong, they’re great to look at … but they don’t do anything. I adore the rotating bezel on my Gear S2 and much prefer it to fiddling with the tiny touchscreen, and the digital crown is a great way to interact with the Apple Watch, so to see both visual cues here with no real functionality feels like a cruel tease from Fossil. Software | Android Wear 2.0 is the star of the Fossil Q. From Google Assistant to the standalone Play Store to better activity tracking with Google Fit, it has all of the features you’d expect from a Wear 2.0 device … and not much more. Fossil’s own website highlights activity tracking as one of the callout features of the Q, mentioning step count, distance, and calories burned, but notably missing from the watch is a heartrate monitor. Those who just want a smartwatch for notifications and not much else won’t mind this omission, but for the more health- and fitness-focused it’s strange to see such a simple feature missing. Still, the software experience on the Q is a pleasingly fast and snappy one. You can wake the display with a press of the stationary (yes, I’m still bitter) crown, and pressing it again from the home screen opens the app list. Fossil has included a few custom watch faces, with plenty of different color and dial combinations. They’re organized within the preinstalled Fossil Q app (though they’re still accessible through a long press of the home screen as well) and add just a touch of uniqueness to this otherwise unremarkable software experience. The most frustrating part of using the Fossil Q x Cory Richards is the poor and inconsistent tilt-to-view functionality. More often than not, I’ve angled the watch towards my face to check a notification only to find that the Q didn’t acknowledge the gesture. To combat this, you could leave the always-on display enabled, but that just leads to another shortcoming… Battery life | …The Q’s subpar battery life. Fossil claims the Q x Cory Richards should last you all day with its 360mAh battery, and while that can easily be achieved with the always-on display setting turned off, flip it back on and you’ll probably need to recharge by dinnertime. To be fair, that’s not a problem exclusive to Fossil — nearly every Android Wear device suffers from poor endurance, but most alternatives do a better job at raise-to-wake detection. Sadly, here your only options are an always-on-except-when-it-dies-halfway-through-the-day display, or a tilt-to-view-sometimes display. When it does come time to re-up the Q, however, its magnetic charging puck is small and easily pocketable, unlike the pedestal style of the Moto 360 or Gear S3. It’s reasonably quick; about an hour and a half should be all it takes to reach 100%. Final thoughts | Whether or not you should buy the Fossil Q x Cory Richards depends on a number of factors. Your wrist size, for one — even at the tightest setting of the leather strap it’s far too big for my tiny wrists, and as much as I enjoy the aesthetics of the watch that’s going to keep me from continuing to use it. It’s also pretty expensive by smartwatch standards at $325, though that’s hardly unheard of for a stainless steel, limited edition designer watch. The Q checks a lot of boxes. It’s well-made, water resistant, runs modern software, and ships with two high-quality watch bands. To sweeten the deal, Fossil also provides a two-year limited warranty. But its high cost and lack of differentiating features make it hard to recommend over other, cheaper smartwatches running Android Wear 2.0. If you have your eyes set on this watch, however, act fast — from May 4 to May 14, Fossil is offering 25% off of the Fossil Q lineup, with the pricing already adjusted on Amazon.

News Stocks Technology Science Tech Space Human Earth Health Politics World Videos TheTape Latest Follow WSP Newsletter RSS Facebook Twitter Google+ Search for: HomeNewsMicrosoft Has Just Unveiled An Awesome Piece Of Hardware (MSFT) Microsoft Has Just Unveiled An Awesome Piece Of Hardware (MSFT) It's about time Redmond came up with a laptop that's comparable with Apple's MacBook Air and Google's Chromebooks. May 6, 2017 WSP At the recent Microsoft EDU event held in New York City, Microsoft’s corporate vice president for Surface Computing, Panos Panay, unveiled what could be one of the company’s best creations ever — a hybrid of the Surface Book laptop and the Surface Pro tablet minus a detachable keyboard: the new Surface Laptop. Scheduled to debut on June 15 at a price tag of $999, the laptop weighs 2.76 lbs., measures 14.55mm thick, and comes in four colors, namely — burgundy, cobalt blue, graphite gold and platinum. It features a 13.5-inch screen, with a resolution of 2256 x 1504 ppi, a 3:2 aspect ratio, and a touchscreen display. It comes with a fabric-covered keyboard that feels unusually warm to the touch (and might take a little getting used to, though in a positive way). Being part of the Surface family, the device works with the Surface Pen (which allows the user to draw on the screen), the Surface Dial and all other standard Windows accessories. On its right side, you’ll find its power connector and a Surface Connect port that allows Surface Dock expansion. On its left, you’ll find a headphone jack, a regular USB 3.0 port, and a Mini DisplayPort. On its bottom under the keyboard are its speakers. There’s no USB-C port, though. Which is kind of surprising and maybe a little bit disappointing considering that most new high-end laptops that come out in the market today already offer this as a standard feature. The laptop is powered by an Intel Core i5 processor with 4 GB of RAM, 128 GB SSD (solid state drive) storage and Intel HD Graphics 620. Its high-end version, on the other hand, features an Intel Core i7 processor, 16 GB of RAM, 512 GB SSD storage, and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640. Double-power specs mean a higher price, of course — $2199. The device runs on Windows 10 S, a version of Windows 10 that’s designed to load faster and demand less from its hardware. It’s also restricted to running apps downloaded exclusively from the Windows Store, which means that traditional desktop apps can only run on the device if they’re specially packaged to work with it, or if the user opts to upgrade to Windows 10 Professional. According to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), its battery will last up to 14.5 hours, and that if you put the device to sleep, then resume working on it a few days later, it will be just like you left it — with no amount of battery loss whatsoever. It’s quite a bold claim, especially in light of the recent report released by British testing publication ‘Which?’, basically saying that most laptop manufacturers’ battery life claims are overstated. But if the Surface Laptop does manage to last 14 hours like Microsoft is claiming, then kudos to the software giant for achieving quite an impressive feat. Based on what has been revealed about it so far, the Surface Laptop seems to be a formidable device that looks great on the outside, and is expected to operate well from the inside. It’s even priced reasonably too. As for its actual performance, we’ll know how it fares in about 2 months. In the meantime, you may watch this video released by Microsoft for a glimpse into what the Surface Laptop is all about.

The update is reportedly rolling out for Koodo’s customers in Canada through the “tkpca” software channel, while Brazilian users are able to download it through the “retbr” channel. It’s currently unclear whether the rollout of the new software package is even wider, though that may not necessarily be the case seeing how Motorola Mobility usually resorts to staged releases as far as Android security updates are concerned. Regardless, the new software version ships with the build number NPNS25-137-24-1-9 and contains a number of fixes for specific vulnerabilities in the Android operating system while also resolving some security issues related to the particular software running on the Moto Z Play. The new update seemingly doesn’t contain any major changes to the end user experience and it doesn’t bring the Android 7.0 Nougat on the device to a higher version of Google’s ubiquitous operating system. Given how the software package is being distributed as an over-the-air (OTA) update, it’s likely rolling out in stages and it may be a while until all users receive a notification telling them that the security patch is available for download. Owners of the Moto Z Play who are feeling impatient may try scanning for the update manually by launching the Settings app on their device and tapping the “Software updates” option located in its “About phone” menu. Alternatively, the user who originally reported about the availability of the update also uploaded the software package to MEGA so that anyone with the necessary know-how can sideload it onto their device. Those interested in doing so can find the software by following the source link beneath this writing, though note that no one can guarantee that an anonymously uploaded security update for the Moto Z Play is legitimate and you’ll be sideloading the software at your own risk. More details about the availability of new software for the device will likely follow in the coming weeks.

Unfortunately, it’s not perfect because a few users experienced some freezes and crashes. The Chromebook suddenly just stops responding and even reboots. There’s a solution and we’ve got it thanks to ChromeOS’s simplicity. Any Chromebook presenting with the above problems can benefit from the solutions listed below. Give them a try in order and you’ll likely solve your Chromebook headaches. The first two options offer the simplest solutions, but didn’t fix the freezing and crashing many users of the new Samsung Chromebook Plus experienced. I had to use the third solution below and reinstall ChromeOS from a flash drive. However, start with the first two since they’re easy to do on a Chromebook, take less time and solve most of the problems people experience with Chromebooks. Reboot the Samsung Chromebook Plus This may seem trite, but have you tried turning it off and on again? That’s a simple non-destructive option for problems on any Chromebook or even a Mac or Windows PC. This often works with your iOS or Android devices, too. To restart a Chromebook press the power button till it turns off and then press it again to turn it back on. While Windows PCs and Macs both include a quick way to restart, the Chromebook doesn’t include such a button. However, it’s still easy. Just Press your Chromebook’s power button or lock button usually in the upper right corner of the keyboard above the backspace key and next to the volume up key. When the Chromebook finishes shutting down, press the button again to restart. I find that easier than clicking the Windows Start button and then clicking the power icon and the restart option. If that doesn’t fix the problems, then try to Powerwash your Chromebook. Powerwash Your Samsung Chromebook Plus This sounds like we’re suggesting you lay your computer out in the driveway and use a pressure washer to clean if up, but the strange term Google used means resetting your computer to factory specs. This erases the computer and it reboots ready to log in with any account. Log in with your account and all your web apps and settings will go back to the way they were. It might solve your Samsung Chromebook Plus freezing problem. This becomes a little more complicated with Google’s addition of the Google Play Store and installing Android apps on ChromeOS. Powerwash your Chromebook by clicking on the user icon in the lower right corner of the screen. Then click on the Settings icon just above the date in the lower left corner of the pop-up box. The new Settings screen will show a search box at the top of the screen. Start typing the word “Powerwash” and you’ll see the option to Powerwash your Chromebook. Click it. Then click on Restart. If you’re Chromebook doesn’t have the latest version of ChromeOS, you’ll need to find the Advanced settings section. Click on Advanced Settings and then find Powerwash by scrolling down. Click it and then click Restart. The Chromebook will restart and show the above screen. Click on the Powerwash button and your Chromebook will erase and restart ready for you to log into your account with a pristine fresh install of the latest version of ChromeOS. After you log in, the system will add back all your Web Apps and settings. Give it a few minutes to complete. The system should work better than it did before. If it doesn’t solve your problem, then try the following. Reinstall ChromeOS in Recovery If you still can’t get your Chromebook working properly, then the final solution may mean reinstalling ChromeOS from a recovery boot drive created by the Chromebook Recovery Utility. The Web App will install in ChromeOS or the Chrome browser on a Mac or Windows PC. This is how I solved my Samsung Chromebook Plus’s freezing problem. Follow the steps on the Google support page for creating your ChromeOS Recovery disk using the web app. You’ll need a USB flash drive or a flash card if your computer supports one. Typically Chromebooks include an SD card slot or a micro-SD card slot. Follow the onscreen instructions in the app. Now it’s time to use the flash drive or card to restore the OS.

Apple executive Phil Schiller revealed he is not a fan of the Amazon Echo or Google Home smart speakers. Apple is reportedly working on its own rival product. Arjun Kharpal | @ArjunKharpal 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Phil Schiller, Apple A top Apple executive revealed he is not a fan of either Amazon's Echo or Google Home's speakers, amid speculation that the company could be releasing its own rival product. In a recent interview with Gadgets 360, Philip Schiller, Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing, took a dig at the devices—which have voice assistants built in. "My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all," Schiller said. Home and Echo both allow users to speak to them and get responses, or carry out "smart home" tasks like managing the thermostat and ensuring security. Apple has yet to release its own product, but a noted analyst recently said that the company is working on a device to rival Amazon and Google. "There is an over 50 percent chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note. WWDC is Apple's annual developers conference. Schiller did however give his thoughts on Siri, Apple's own voice assistant, and acknowledged that there are situations where a screen would not be needed. "For example, if you're driving (and) you want Siri to work for you without having to look at the screen, that's the best thing," Schiller said to Gadgets 360. "Or maybe you're across the room, and you want to ask Siri to change the song you were listening to - you don't have to walk over and back (and you can use Siri instead)." He added that while a voice assistant is "really beneficial" at times, having access to a touch screen device was still essential. "So the idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations," the executive told the publication. "For example if I'm looking for directions and I'm using Maps, Siri can tell me those directions by voice and that's really convenient but it's even better if I can see that map, and I can see what turns are coming up, and I can see where there is congestion, I understand better my route, and what I'm going to do," Schiller said.

Google creates highly accurate lip-reading software Ryan Thomas Namia December 4, 2016 12:45 pm TECHNOLOGY 2.3K 0 DUBAI – Researchers from Google’s AI division DeepMind and the University of Oxford have collaborated and used artificial intelligence to make the most accurate lip-reading software to date. According to a report by cbronline.com, the AI system, which was trained using almost 5,000 hours of TV footage from the BBC, contained a total of 118,000 sentences from the videos. The key contributions include a “Watch, Listen, Attend and Spell” (WLAS), a network that learns to transcribe videos of mouth motion to characters. In an article published by arix.org, the goal of the work was to recognize phrases and sentences uttered by a talking face, with or without the audio. DeepMind stated that unlike previous works that have focused on recognizing a limited number of words or phrases, they tackle lip reading as an open-world problem – unconstrained natural language sentences, and in the wild videos. The same media report added that the AI was trained on shows which aired during the period between January 2010 and December 2015, and later tested its performance on programs between March and September of this year. The lip reader was only able to decipher less than one-quarter of the spoken words, whilst the WLAS model was able to decipher half of the spoken words. Based on the report, citing the News Scientist, Ziheng Zhou at the University of Oulu, Finland, said that it was a big step for developing fully automatic lip-reading systems. “Without the huge dataset, it’s very difficult for us to verify new technologies like deep learning,” he added. In its summary, the architecture of the WLAS model surpassed the performance of all previous work on standard lip reading benchmark datasets, and demonstrated that visual information helps to improve speech recognition performance even when audio is used.  Facebook Comments Website Comments mike tyson March 6th, 2017 Reply z1SL9Y Really appreciate you sharing this article.Thanks Again. rasen schneiden March 6th, 2017 Reply A big thank you for your blog article.Really looking forward to read more.

Of course, this gives users hope that it also meant the start of Android O’s beta program. Development in Android’s beta program should now shift to the next version of the Android platform, and users are hoping to jump on early to that particular bandwagon. For the last two Android releases, Google’s beta program allowed Nexus and Pixel users to test out upcoming features and builds before anyone else. It looks like this is set to continue – fingers crossed – with Android O. Android O’s developer preview has been available for a few months, but it was plainly said that this was not the public beta and wasn’t intended for a mainstream audience. Now, if we go by what information is available at Android’s developer page, it looks like there will be a second developer preview build in the middle of May – which is listed as a beta. We can only hope that this means the public beta for Android O will begin. If you want to stake out that particular bit of information, you can hang around the official community account at Google+. Anything that would be announced should go through that account as well, so happy waiting, you guys.

(Jason DeCrow/AP Images for Microsoft) Microsoft's new Windows 10 S system, which the company showed off Tuesday, looks like a direct competitor to Chrome OS, the operating system that powers Google's low-cost Chromebooks. (Jason DeCrow/AP Images for Microsoft)   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     Microsoft just held a big launch in New York, but it didn't show off flashy new software or a pricey new piece of hardware for the average consumer. Instead, it gathered media and analysts together to talk about going back to school. The company announced a slew of products for the education market on Tuesday, including a school-focused version of Windows, new features for Office and a new type of laptop targeted at college students. All of its announcements aim to get more of its technology into the hands of more students -- regardless of their abilities or economic status. "Talent is everywhere. Opportunity is not," said Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella, who opened the presentation with a personal story about how his great-grandfather's education paved the way for his own success. Competition in the education space has been ramping up in recent years, as Google's inexpensive Chromebook laptops have shaken Apple's long-standing association with education. Chromebooks made up 58 percent of K-12 mobile-device shipments late last year, according to estimates from the consulting firm Futuresource -- a gain of 50 percent from the year before, while Microsoft made up 22 percent and Apple's iOS and MacOS together captured 19 percent. Microsoft, after years of focusing on business customers, is refocusing some of its efforts on the lucrative education market as part of a broader strategy to attract creative users. That was clearly the target market for the $999 Surface Laptop, which boasts an impressive 14.5 hours of battery life, as compared with the 10 to 12 hours from Apple's MacBook line. Its touch screen also works with the Surface Pen stylus, and the laptop is compatible with the Surface Dial -- features that Microsoft hopes will attract users who want to move beyond the keyboard and trackpad. With its new Surface Laptop, Microsoft is taking steady aim at Apple and its popularity among college students. The laptop's sleek design echoes the clean lines of the MacBook Air and MacBook, but the four extra hours of battery life could make it easier to finish an after-class library study session without having to haul around a charger all day. The $999 laptop isn't exactly a budget device, but it fits a critical audience that may not be able to afford Microsoft's high-power $1500 Surface Book. "This fills an important gap in their device offerings," said Christopher Voce, an analyst at Forrester, who expects that this new device will be critical to Microsoft's Surface line in the future. The company's new Windows 10 S system, which the company showed off Tuesday, looks like a direct competitor to Chrome OS, the operating system that powers Google's low-cost Chromebooks. Users will only be able to install programs from the Windows store, including its Office Suite, that are similar to the stripped-down options that come on Google's lightweight laptops. The system is due out before the new school year. Microsoft also announced new Office features, including upgrades to OneNote, Word and PowerPoint, to make all of them easier for people with learning or physical disabilities to use. For example, there's an Office feature that will read text aloud at various speeds, and separate words into syllables, which can be particularly useful for those with dyslexia. Those features make a world of difference to her students, said Lauren Pittman, a special-education teacher in Canton, Georgia, whose students were allowed to test the features before they were officially announced. Her students are "so much more confident, that's the biggest thing," Pittman said, because the features let them learn at their own speed and spare them the embarrassment of having to have a staff member read their class materials with them. Other features, such as built-in support for the screen readers that the visually impaired use to read documents on a computer, also make it much easier for teachers, students and parents to interact and communicate -- offering the opportunities that Nadella said he wants the company to provide for all students. From a business standpoint, locking up the lucrative education market -- in which companies often sell hundreds or even thousands of devices at a time -- is critical for any company that makes hardware, analysts said. It also has a sort of "hearts and minds" aspect to it, Voce said. "You're indoctrinating students into a way to engage with technology. The manner in which we use devices and apps is influenced by what we use in school," he said. For Microsoft, which has refocused its message around "creators" and the liberal-arts set that has traditionally belonged to Apple, being able to boost student creativity and productivity is critical to appealing to a new generation.

The Chromebook has gone from a standing start in 2011 to wild popularity in the market for education technology, which tech companies have traditionally viewed as a critical way to win over the next generation of users. In 2016, mobile devices running Google’s Chrome operating system accounted for 58% of the U.S. market for primary and secondary schools, according to Futuresource Consulting. The Microsoft products, including a new version of its Windows OS software to boost collaboration among students and a new Surface laptop, clearly show the influence of the Chromebook, industry watchers say. ‘Awakes giants’ The success of the Chromebook has awakened sleeping giants, said Tyler Bosmeny, CEO of Clever, an education technology company. “There’s so much investment into the space, it’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen.” For years after the release of the Chromebook in 2011, Apple Inc. and Microsoft stuck to their strategies of offering slightly modified and discounted versions of their products for educators. But the Chromebook’s low price, starting at $149, and easy management proved irresistible to many schools. Google also saw a key chance to expand its market share several years ago with the approach of an online testing mandate in the U.S. To capitalise on the opportunity, Google created a test mode, restricting access to the rest of the Web while students complete assessments, said Rajen Sheth, a senior director of product management at Google. The preparations paid off: sales of the Chromebook jumped tenfold between 2012 and 2013, he said. While Google makes some Chromebooks, the devices aimed at the education market are supplied by partners such as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. and Acer Inc. The OS is free for educators and hardware manufacturers, and Google sells schools an education package, with device management and support for a $30 fee. ‘Emulating Chromebook’ For Microsoft, Tuesday’s event was the culmination of a campaign to emulate key aspects of the Chromebook strategy, said Mike Fisher, associate director, education division, Futuresource Consulting. Microsoft’s hardware partners are now selling hybrid devices based on the Surface design starting at $189. Microsoft executives boasted that the OS announced Tuesday boots up rapidly, a hallmark of the Chromebook. The company also introduced a code-builder to its Minecraft education edition to help students learn coding skills through the popular game. For Microsoft, the test will be how easily it can explain its offering to educators, he said. The Google education ecosystem is quite straightforward,” he said. “With Microsoft, there’s a lot of moving parts.” Microsoft declined to comment. Apple, for its part, has lowered the price of the iPad to $299 for education customers and made it possible for students to share devices. It’s about trying to reach every teacher and every student, said Susan Prescott, a vice president of product management and marketing at Apple. Despite Google’s U.S. dominance, its position is weaker in classrooms overseas, said Mr. Fisher of Futuresource Consulting. In 2016, devices running Android and Chrome made up 23% of the mobile market outside the U.S., compared with 65% for Microsoft’s Windows, according to Futuresource.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

Public domain. By many accounts, 2017 is poised to be a breakout year for virtual assistants and the artificial intelligence (AI) technologies underpinning those tools. This year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas featured the dominance of Amazon.com Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Alexa virtual assistant which was baked into all kinds of consumer product offerings at the show, from refrigerators to automobiles. Wider development of AI and virtual assistant technologies are already being produced by many of America’s tech giants and should support one-fifth of human interactions with smartphones by the year 2019. As defined by market research firm Gartner, virtual assistants are conversational, computer-based characters which simulate a conversation to deliver either voice- or text-based information to a user via a Web, kiosk or mobile interface. A recent survey of American consumers by sales and marketing AI developer Conversica found that 52 percent of respondents felt that the use of virtual assistants at work would help them to be more productive in their jobs, with younger respondents being much more willing to use virtual assistants than senior citizens. Virtual assistant tech is also making forays into customer relationship management (CRM) operations in industries including healthcare and air travel. Millennials have been embracing the use of virtual assistants for performing a wide range of simple tasks, including making phone calls, playing music, shopping, setting alarms and checking their personal calendars. Despite the fact that every major tech name is involved in the development of virtual assistants, conversational AI services continue to be introduced by smaller firms and startups in the space all over the world. French telecommunications company Orange (NYSE:ORAN) has recently rolled out a new Djingo virtual assistant service for its customers which is incorporated into the company’s set-top boxes. French information technology services firm Atos (EPA:ATO) has recently released the Atos Virtual Assistant providing machine learning capabilities via cloud services to improve user IT support. In mid-April, Cambridge, MA-based software developer Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) unveiled the Pega Intelligent Virtual Assistant, an AI tool which uses natural language processing to create responsive chatbots for a variety of business scenarios. Lucida is an open source platform designed for the development of intelligent personal assistants which incorporate image and language processing technologies. Based on research performed at the University of Michigan’s (UM) Clarity Lab, Lucida began as a research platform for identifying ways in which future data centers and cloud computing technologies should be developed to optimize virtual assistants, according to UM research fellow and Clinc Inc. VP & co-founder Johann Hauswald. “Through open source packages, we’ve actively developed open source tools and put together a representative application to see what such an assistant would look like if deployed by Google or Apple,” Hauswald said. Hauswald said that the work of Clarity Lab and Clinc, an Ann Arbor, MI-based startup founded by the UM research team, was responsive to desires among business contacts which want to develop their own virtual assistant without relying on Siri or Google Now. “The differentiator here is that we allow full customization and control of not only the features but also the data,” he said. Companies seeking to develop their own virtual assistants want to do so in order to keep their customer data private and not create privacy issues with major tech firms having third-party access to that data. Clinc is a startup based on the research performed at Clarity Lab but there has been no tech transfer from the university, Hauswald said. Rather, Clinc uses the open source Lucida platform to develop virtual assistants for personal finance applications. Last March, Clinc closed its first round of seed funding, taking in $1.2 million and reaching a market valuation of $5 million. This February, news reports indicated that Clinc raised another $6.3 million in funding which the company would use on additional R&D and hires. Hound, the virtual assistant developed by Santa Clara, CA-based sound search tech developer SoundHound Inc., is an option on the market which is backed by a fairly strong suite of intellectual property. “We’re the only private company that has the entirety of the technology suite you need to do natural language processing,” said Katie McMahon, general manager at SoundHound. Readers might remember the original SoundHound app first released in 2005 which could find information about songs using sound recognition technology. Hound uses similar technology to perform state-of-the-art natural language processing tasks. One competitive edge held by SoundHound is its portfolio of what McMahon called “sound-to-meaning” technologies. Most virtual assistants utilize speech-to-text technologies which transcribe what a person says into text and then processes that text for meaning. This introduces an extra transcription step which can introduce errors in transcription and add to the latency of the technology. The deep meaning understanding of SoundHound allows users to query the system using questions which have a much more complicated syntax than what a Siri or Alexa can handle. One example given by McMahon is the voice command, “Show me hotels in Seattle with amenities [within a certain price range] within two miles of the Space Needle.” “When you envision the future in 25 years, are we going to speak stilted Tarzan speak to everything around us?” McMahon asked, noting that SoundHound has gone to excruciating pains to develop technologies which effectively answer the need for speech-to-meaning technologies. “It takes a small, nimble group of folks to go through the painstaking process in R&D,” she said. Along with the Hound and SoundHound apps, SoundHound also offers a Houndify virtual assistant development platform for businesses to create customized Hound operating systems for their own customers. According to McMahon, the Houndify community included 24,000 developers as of 2017 producing hundreds of active Houndify projects. When Houndify launched in 2015, it already offered developers 100 domains in natural language processing including local search, unit conversion, weather, financial information, site status and places of interest. Comparatively, McMahon noted that Siri launched with six domains and even after years of development, both Siri and Google Now only offer a couple dozen domains. Although McMahon wouldn’t disclose the size of the company’s patent portfolio, she did say that we can “assume that intellectual property is critical and tantamount to what we do.” The company has been able to effectively leverage its portfolio for successful rounds of investment funding, including a $75 million round of funding which closed this January. That round of funding followed announcements earlier in the month that SoundHound has established Houndify partnerships with audio device developers Onkyo and Sharp for developing their own customized virtual assistants for use in their respective devices. Last September, SoundHound announced that Uber and Yelp were developing their own respective virtual assistants on Houndify for developing voice-enabled conversational intelligence tools. Sunnyvale, CA-based Mezi offers a virtual assistant which focuses on a person’s travel needs. Mezi actually pivoted its focus late last year from an all-purpose virtual assistant to a travel assistant which, unlike other online travel booking services, handles both discovery and the actual transaction for the consumer. “Through major partnerships with travel category leaders like Expedia and American Express, Mezi is targeting its search and personalization functionality on corporate travel, creating both efficiency for the corporate travel agent and a seamless experience for the end-user,” said Swapnil Shinde, CEO and co-founder of Mezi. According to Shinde, Mezi is attempting to create the first end-to-end travel booking experience for corporate travel which is entirely powered by artificial intelligence. The virtual assistant utilizes natural language messaging interaction tools which both create a more personable experience and helps to gather requirements and preferences for each corporate employee booking travel options through the service. As of this February, the effectiveness of Mezi’s virtual assistant bot was allowing the company to serve three times as many customers that the company’s human employees serve each day, completing 60 percent of Mezi’s flight requests and 38 percent of hotal requests processed by the company. Shinde also noted that Mezi can also help business professionals adjust their travel itinerary in the midst of their trips. “Users tell Mezi what needs to be done and then Mezi handles the onerous tasks like re-booking flights, changing hotel reservation, updating dinner reservations and anything else that might come up as well as make personalized recommendations on things to do and sights to see in the area for maximizing after-work hours in a new city,” Shinde said. Last July, Mezi announced a $9 million Series A round of funding months before the company shifted its focus towards travel booking services.

They should have scored more than one in a dominant first-half display; they certainly made up for that in the second period. They go into third, four goals better off than Liverpool, who have been nudged down to fourth. Champions League football next season is now within touching distance. As for Palace, safety is not yet guaranteed. Wins for Hull and Swansea later on would seriously turn up the pressure; the game between Palace and Hull at Selhurst next week now looms large.

First Zabaleta tries to find Sterling on the penalty spot from the right. Not quite. Then Fernandinho curls one in from a deep position on the same wing. Sane, coming in from the left, meets it first time and attempts to guide it into the bottom right. Nice idea, but poor execution, as the ball flies miles wide right.

City come back at Palace again, Silva twisting this way and that down the inside-right channel, working space to shoot on the right-hand edge of the D. His low effort is pulled wide right.

City will wonder how they’re not miles out in front. But they let Palace grow into the game towards the end of the half. Their season in microcosm. It’s all set up for a fascinating second 45. Don’t go anywhere! Pep Guardiola looks frustrated during the first half.

Free kick. The City fans aren’t happy, because a few seconds earlier, Puncheon clattered into Sane as the winger crossed from the left, but the whistle didn’t go. The resulting free kick is plucked from the sky by Hennessey, and Zaha’s sent skittering down the left. De Bruyne and notorious hard man Silva take turns to send Zaha spinning, but again the whistle doesn’t go. On the touchline, Sam Allardyce delivers his own verdict in the Anglo-Saxon style.

Now the roles are reversed, as De Bruyne pays him back with an agitated clip on the Palace man’s ankle. The referee tells both players to stop being so bloody stupid, grown men and all.

He’s very nearly robbed by Benteke, and takes a clank on his tootsies for the trouble. He hops about in pain, but at least he’s not feeling the hot flush of embarrassment across his cheeks.

Google Nexus 6P – Why Does it Stand out from the Rest?

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. All rumors and speculations are indicating towards the fact that Google wants to refresh its Nexus 6P offering. The smartphone was first launched back in the fall of 2015 and it’s still making waves in the smartphone industry. One of the most intriguing things about Nexus 6P is not the fact that it’s selling so well despite its age but that it has managed to gather a large fan base. We think that the reason why Nexus 6P has one of the largest fan bases in the Android world is because first off all Google is directly in charge of it and also because it provides users with outstanding performances. Huawei is the company that was in charge of equipping Nexus 6P with hardware parts and it’s safe to say that the Chinese manufacturer has done an amazing job at that. With that being said, today we’re going to take look under Nexus 6P’s hood and see what makes it so special. Processor and RAM Qualcomm is the biggest mobile processor manufacturer in the world right now and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Nexus 6P is fueled by one of Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 810 CPU. The processor features eight cores which clock at 1.55GHz and 2.0GHz. If this doesn’t seem impressive enough, maybe you should know that Nexus 6P’s processor has also been coupled with 3GB RAM and an Adreno 430 graphics processing unit. Storage Space and Battery Smartphones have become essential items to our everyday lives because of their endless amount of uses. Many users tend to store work related documents on their gadgets in order to make it easier to edit and carry them around and this is why Nexus 6P’s storage space matters so much. Because Google decided to not include microSD support, Nexus 6P offers a wide range of storage space in compensation for that. The smartphone can be acquired in the 32GB, 64GB and 128GB of on-board storage space variants. When it comes to battery, Nexus 6P impresses with its huge non-removable Li-Po 3,450 mAh battery that’s able of lasting for days on end.

Google’s update helps avoid crowds in real time Ryan Thomas Namia December 4, 2016 12:33 pm TECHNOLOGY 2.4K 0 DUBAI – Google’s latest update helps users avoid packed places in real time. Photo from Google) The firm has started to roll this out last week, just look up a business and tap on the arrow to get more information. The search engine will give users a live analysis on how busy the business is and what users are up against if he goes there. The latest enhancement, according to a cnet.com report, will determine how crowded an area is within an hour’s time based on aggregated, anonymized location history data. “It can also help users manage their time by providing live crowd numbers for specific businesses,” the report said noting that one could check the stores around it to see where he can go to kill time until the crowd dies down. For restaurants, it added that it will give you a hint of how long one might have to wait for a table well before reaching the door.  Facebook Comments Website Comments clash of clan hack December 28th, 2016 Reply I always spent my half an hour to read this web site’s articles every day along with a mug of coffee. love anal March 5th, 2017 Reply jaJiDQ Your means of describing the whole thing in this post is really good, all be able to easily understand it, Thanks a lot. venue finder March 6th, 2017 Reply Hey, thanks for the blog post.Really looking forward to read more.

Business Standard Fake news, echo chambers and filter bubbles: Underresearched and overhyped Don't panic: An international survey finds concerns about fake news are overblown William H.

Send me a copy:   http://mybs.in/2UVetbv ALSO READ Devangshu Datta: Peddling fake news Google, Facebook cut ad revenue to 'fake' news sites post US election controversies Facebook shareholders propose reports on 'fake news', pay equality Fake news, real threat Here's why Facebook's 'fake news' plan is doomed to failure In the early years of the internet, it was revolutionary to have a world of information just a click away from anyone, anywhere, anytime. Many hoped this inherently democratic technology could lead to better-informed citizens more easily participating in debate, elections and public discourse. Today, though, many observers are concerned that search algorithms and social media are undermining the quality of online information people see. They worry that bad information may be weakening democracy in the digital age. The problems include online services conveying fake news, splitting users into “filter bubbles” of like-minded people and enabling users to unwittingly lock themselves up in virtual echo chambers that reinforce their own biases. These concerns are much discussed, but have not yet been thoroughly studied. What research does exist has typically been limited to a single platform, such Twitter or Facebook. Our study of search and politics in seven nations – which surveyed the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and Spain in January 2017 – found these concerns to be overstated, if not wrong. In fact, many internet users trust search to help them find the best information, check other sources and discover new information in ways that can burst filter bubbles and open echo chambers. Surveying internet users We sought to learn directly from people about how they used search engines, social media and other sources of information about politics. Through funding from Google, we conducted an online survey of more than 14,000 internet users in seven nations. We found that the fears surrounding search algorithms and social media are not irrelevant – there are problems for some users some of the time. However, they are exaggerated, creating unwarranted fears that could lead to inappropriate responses by users, regulators and policymakers. The importance of searching The survey findings demonstrate the importance of search results over other ways to get information. When people are looking for information, they very often search the internet. Nearly two-thirds of users across our seven nations said they use a search engine to look for news online at least once a day. They view search results as equally accurate and reliable as other key sources, like television news. In line with that general finding, a search engine is the first place internet users go online for information about politics. Moreover, those internet users who are very interested in politics, and who participate in political activities online, are the most likely to use a search engine like Bing or Google to find information online about politics. But crucially, those same users engaged in search are also very likely to get information about politics on other media, exposing themselves to diverse sources of information, which makes them more likely to encounter diverse viewpoints. Further, we found that people who are interested and involved in politics online are more likely to double-check questionable information they find on the internet and social media, including by searching online for additional sources in ways that will pop filter bubbles and break out of echo chambers. Internet-savvy or not? It’s not just politically interested people who have these helpful search habits: People who use the internet more often and have more practice searching online do so as well. That leaves the least politically interested people and the least skilled internet users as most susceptible to fake news, filter bubbles and echo chambers online. These individuals could benefit from support and training in digital literacy. However, for most people, internet searches are critical for checking the reliability and validity of information they come across, whether online, on social media, on traditional media or in everyday conversation. Our research shows that these internet users find search engines useful for checking facts, discovering new information, understanding others’ views on issues, exploring their own views and deciding how to vote. International variations We found that people in different countries do vary in how much they trust and rely on the internet and searches for information. For example, internet users in Germany, and to a lesser extent those in France and the United Kingdom, are more trusting in TV and radio news, and more skeptical of searches and online information. Internet users in Germany rate the reliability of search engines lower than those in all the other nations, with 44 percent saying search engines are reliable, compared with 50 to 57 percent across the other six countries. In Poland, Italy and Spain, people trust traditional broadcast media less and are more reliant on, and trusting of, internet and searching. Americans are in the middle; there were greater differences within European countries than between Europe as a whole and the U.S. American internet users were so much more likely to consult multiple sources of information that we called them “media omnivores.” Internet users generally rely on a diverse array of sources for political information. And they display a healthy skepticism, leading them to question information and check facts. Regulating the internet, as some have proposed, could undermine existing trust and introduce new questions about accuracy and bias in search results. But panic over fake news, echo chambers and filter bubbles is exaggerated, and not supported by the evidence from users across seven countries. William H.
